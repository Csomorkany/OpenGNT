# Upgraded to Version 3

<b>25 August 2018:</b> The base text of OpenGNT project had been upgraded to version 3.  Previous versions, 1 & 2, are no longer supported.

There are 2 major files: 
- Base Text of OGNT: <a href='https://github.com/eliranwong/OpenGNT/blob/master/OpenGNT_BASE_TEXT.zip'>OpenGNT_BASE_TEXT.zip</a>
- Keyed Features and Mapping IDs: <a href='https://github.com/eliranwong/OpenGNT/blob/master/OpenGNT_keyedFeatures.csv.zip'>OpenGNT_keyedFeatures.csv.zip</a>

The base text of OpenGNT project, OGNT, is currently the closest equivalent to the text of NA28.

The base text and the rest of Open Greek New Testament Project is released under a public license described below.

Comparison between OGNT and NA28 is briefly described <a href='https://github.com/eliranwong/OpenGNT/tree/master/mapping_BGB/compare_OGNT_NA28'>HERE</a>.

# Open Greek New Testament Project

Open Greek New Testament project aims to provide a bundle of high-quality and open-source materials on Greek New Testament for biblical studies.
<br><br>
An eclectic text, namely "Open Greek New Testament [OGNT]", is first produced as the base text for the rest of the project.  The text of OPNT is built upon a group of high-quality scholarly materials</a>.  This aims to provide all bible students or scholars <b>a free text</b>, which is <a href='https://github.com/eliranwong/OpenGNT/tree/master/CompareOGNTwithNA28'><b>the closest equivalent to the text of NA28</b></a>, for studies or research purposes.

# Source: A brief History 

<b>From Nestle (1904) to OpenGNT</b>

The latest base text of Open Greek New Testament Project, OGNT in short, was compiled from Berean Greek Bible and its associated database, which is primarily based on the Greek New Testament, <a href='https://sites.google.com/site/nestle1904/'>Η ΚΑΙΝΗ ΔΙΑΘΗΚΗ</a>, edited by Eberhard Nestle, published in 1904 by the British and Foreign Bible Society.

The Greek New Testament (Nestle, 1904) is now a public domain document worldwide, without any limitations for use or copyright issues.  <a href='https://berean.bible/committee.htm'>The Berean Bible Translation Committee</a> adopted it years ago as the base text for developing Berean Greek Bible and associated resources on New Testament.  

The final text of <a href='https://greekbible.org'>Berean Greek Bible</a> is primary based on Nestle Greek New Testament (1904), with standardisation of spellings and textual decisions reflecting the best and earliest manuscripts.  In addition, Berean translation table marks some significant textual variants of popular critical Greek New Testament editions, with <a href='https://greekbible.org'>a set of symbols</a>.

In August, 2018, Eliran Wong [<a href='https://biblebento.com'>BibleBento.com</a>] received permission from John Isett [<a href='https://biblehub.com'>BibleHub.com</a>] to integrate Berean Greek Bible and its associated data into Open Greek New Testament Project, for compilation, mapping resources and distribution.

As the original Greek New Testament (Nestle, 1904) is akin to recent editions of NA texts (e.g. NA27, NA28), Berean Greek data soon became obvious to be a very good source for compiling a base text for use in Open Greek New Testament Project, for further mapping valuables resources based on NA27 / NA28.

<b>Compilation of the base text of OGNT</b>

Berean Greek Bible and its associated data were then taken into review and processed, for compilation of a NA-equivalent Greek New Testament.  The process of compilation is briefly described below:

- Variants markers were reviewed, a few were refined.
- Three missing variants from Byzantine text were added to the database.
- <a href='https://github.com/greekcntr/BHP'>Bunning Heuristic Prototype Greek New Testament</a>, BHP in short, released by <a href='https://greekcntr.org'>Center for New Testament Restoration</a>, was compared in the review process.  BHP was taken into weighing textual decisions, as it reflects the latest efforts to reflect the best and earliest manuscripts.  BHP was not considered in the development of Berean Greek Bible, because it had not been published at the first launch of Berean Greek Bible.  The result is that two textual variants, taken from the text of BHP, were added to the database.
- Berean Greek Bible uses KJV versification.  Mapping data to original GNT's versification (Nestle 1904).  Minor variations follows the versification of SBLGNT.
- Punctuation marks adapts data provided in <a href='https://github.com/tyndale/STEPBible-Data'>TANTT - Tyndale Amalgamated NT Tagged texts</a>.  OpenGNT project further places punctuation marks into two groups, i.e. those preceding a word and those following a word.

<b>Transparency</b>

- To ensure transparency, the original database for compilation, including Berean Greek Data, and additional data mentioned above, is uploaded <a href='https://github.com/eliranwong/OpenGNT/blob/master/mapping_BGB/source_BereanGreekBible_Inclusive.csv.zip'>HERE</a>.
- The process of the compilation is repeatable through the use of a simple Python script uploaded <a href='https://github.com/eliranwong/OpenGNT/blob/master/mapping_BGB/script/compileOGNT.py'>HERE</a>.  The script is provided for the sake of transparency.  In addition, it may be useful for validation or checking.

Usage of the script:
- unzip file "source_BereanGreekBible_Inclusive.csv.zip"
- places files "berean_tablesInclusive.csv" and "compileOGNT.py" in the same folder
- run command "python compileOGNT.py"

<b>Result and Comparison with NA28</b>

The resulting text is suprisingly very close to the text of NA28.  The latest version (version 3).  It only has 111 words different from from the text of NA28.  It is not only the closest equivalent to the text of NA28 / NA27, but also the best candidate, apart from copyrighted NA28 / NA27, for mapping resources originally keyed to NA28 / NA27, e.g. OpenText Linguistic Annotations, Levinsohn Greek New Testament discourse features.
