000500	where
000501	
000502	the Christ
000503	was to be born.
000504	
000505	
000506	they said,

000511	of Judea,”
000512	this way
000513	“for

000537	
000538	my people

000540	
000541	Israel.’”
000542	Then
000543	Herod
000544	privately
000545	summoned
000546	
000547	the wise men
000548	and determined
000549	from them

000551	
000552	when

000655	their own country.
000656	
000657	After they had gone,
000658	
000659	
000660	
000661	an angel

000681	
000682	and stay
000683	there

000712	
000713	He stayed
000714	there
000715	until
000716	
000717	died.
000718	Herod
000719	In this way
000720	was fulfilled:
000721	
000722	what was spoken
000723	by
000724	the Lord
000725	through
000726	
000727	the prophet
000728	
000729	out of
000730	Egypt.”
000731	“I called
000732	
000733	my Son
000734	
000735	
000736	When Herod
000737	saw
000738	
000739	that he had been tricked
000740	by
000741	
000742	the wise men,
000743	he became enraged.
000744	
000745	
000746	He sent
000747	men to kill
000748	all
000749	
000750	the children
000751	
000752	in
000753	Bethlehem
000754	
000755	
000756	and throughout
000757	
000758	the surrounding region
000759	
000760	from
000761	the age of two
000762	
000763	and under,
000764	according
000765	
000766	to the time
000767	
000768	he had learned
000769	from
000770	
000771	the wise men.
000772	Then
000773	was fulfilled:
000774	
000775	
000776	by
000777	Jeremiah
000778	
000779	the prophet
000780	what was spoken
000781	“A voice
000782	in
000783	Ramah,
000784	was heard
000785	weeping
000786	
000787	wailing,
000788	and loud
000789	Rachel
000790	weeping
000791	
000792	for her children,
000793	
000794	
000795	and she did not
000796	want
000797	to be comforted,
000798	
000799	gone.”
000800	because they were
000801	had died,
000802	
000803	
000804	After Herod
000805	
000806	an angel
000807	of the Lord
000808	appeared
000809	in
000810	a dream
000811	
000812	to Joseph
000813	in
000814	Egypt
000815	saying,
000816	“Get up,
000817	take
000818	
000819	the child
000820	
000821	
000822	and his mother,
000823	
000824	
000825	and go
000826	to
000827	the land
000828	of Israel,
000829	are dead.”
000830	for
000831	
000832	those who were seeking
000833	
000834	life
000835	
000836	the child’s
000837	
000838	So
000839	he got up
000840	and took
000841	
000842	the child
000843	
000844	
000845	and his mother
000846	
000847	
000848	and returned
000849	to
000850	the land
000851	of Israel.
000852	when he heard
000853	But
000854	
000855	that Archelaus
000856	was reigning
000857	
000858	over Judea
000859	in place of
000860	
000861	his father
000862	
000863	Herod,
000864	he was afraid
000865	there.
000866	to go
000867	After being warned
000868	
000869	in
000870	a dream,
000871	he went
000872	to
000873	
000874	the regions
000875	
000876	of Galilee.
000877	
000878	He came
000879	and lived
000880	to
000881	a town
000882	called
000883	Nazareth
000884	there. Then
000885	was fulfilled,
000886	
000887	what had been spoken
000888	by
000889	
000890	the prophets
000891	
000892	a Nazarene.
000893	that Jesus would be called
000894	In
000895	
000896	
000897	days
000898	those
000899	came
000900	John
000901	
000902	the Baptist
000903	proclaiming,
000904	into
000905	
000906	the wilderness
000907	
000908	of Judea
000909	
000910	
000911	“Repent,
000912	is near.”
000913	for
000914	
000915	the kingdom
000916	
000917	of heaven
000918	
000919	For
000920	he is
000921	
000922	
000923	
000924	Isaiah
000925	
000926	the one about whom the prophet
000927	had spoken:
000928	“The voice
000929	of one shouting
000930	in
000931	
000932	the wilderness,
000933	‘Prepare
000934	
000935	the way
000936	for the Lord,
000937	straight.’”
000938	make
000939	
000940	his paths
000941	
000942	
000943	Now
000944	
000945	John
000946	wore
000947	
000948	clothing
000949	
000950	made from
000951	hair
000952	camel’s
000953	
000954	belt
000955	with a leather
000956	around
000957	
000958	his waist,
000959	
000960	
000961	and
000962	his diet
000963	consisted of
000964	
000965	locusts
000966	
000967	honey.
000968	and wild
000969	Then
000970	were going out
000971	to him,
000972	
000973	people from Jerusalem,
000974	
000975	as well as all
000976	
000977	Judea
000978	
000979	and all
000980	
000981	the region around
000982	
000983	the Jordan,
000984	
000985	and he was baptizing
000986	them in
000987	
000988	the Jordan
000989	River
000990	
000991	
000992	as they confessed
000993	
000994	their sins.
000995	
000996	when he saw
000997	But
000998	many
000999	
001000	Pharisees
001001	
001002	and Sadducees
001003	coming
001004	to
001005	
001006	his baptism,
001007	
001008	he said to them,
001009	
001010	“You offspring
001011	of vipers!
001012	Who
001013	warned
001014	you
001015	to flee
001016	from
001017	
001018	the coming
001019	wrath?
001020	produce
001021	Therefore
001022	fruit
001023	that proves
001024	
001025	your repentance,
001026	
001027	and don’t
001028	think
001029	you can say
001030	to
001031	yourselves,
001032	as our father.’
001033	‘We have
001034	
001035	Abraham
001036	I tell you
001037	For
001038

001040	can
001041	
001042	that God
001043	from
001044	
001045	these stones!
001046	
001047	raise up
001048	children
001049	
001050	for Abraham
001051	now
001052	Even
001053	
001054	the ax
001055	at
001056	
001057	the root
001058	
001059	of the trees,
001060	is laid
001061	every
001062	and
001063	tree
001064	that does not
001065	produce
001066	fruit
001067	good
001068	will be cut down
001069	
001070	into
001071	the fire.
001072	and thrown
001073	
001074	
001075	
001076	“I baptize you
001077	with
001078	water,
001079	for
001080	repentance,
001081	
001082	but
001083	after me
001084	
001085	the one coming
001086	more powerful
001087	
001088	is
001089	
001090	I am not
001091	than I am –
001092	worthy
001093	
001094	his sandals!
001095	to carry
001096	
001097	
001098	He will baptize you
001099	with
001100	Spirit
001101	the Holy
001102	
001103	and fire.
001104	
001105	
001106	His winnowing fork
001107	is in
001108	
001109	his hand,
001110	
001111	
001112	and he will clean out
001113	
001114	his threshing floor
001115	
001116	
001117	and will gather
001118	
001119	his wheat
001120	
001121	into
001122	
001123	the storehouse,
001124	
001125	but
001126	the chaff
001127	he will burn up
001128	fire!”
001129	with inextinguishable
001130	Then
001131	came
001132	
001133	Jesus
001134	from
001135	
001136	Galilee
001137	in
001138	
001139	the Jordan River.
001140	to
001141	
001142	John
001143	
001144	to be baptized
001145	by him
001146	
001147	
001148	But
001149	
001150	John tried to prevent him,
001151	
001152	saying,
001153	
001154	“I need
001155	
001156	by you,
001157	
001158	to be baptized
001159	
001160	
001161	and yet you come
001162	to me?”
001163	
001164	replied
001165	So
001166	
001167	Jesus
001168	
001169	to him,
001170	
001171	“Let it happen
001172	now,
001173	
001174	for
001175	right
001176	it is
001177	for us
001178	to fulfill
001179	all
001180	righteousness.”
001181	Then
001182	John yielded to him.
001183	
001184	was baptized,
001185	
001186	
001187	After Jesus
001188	just as
001189	he was coming up
001190	out of
001191	
001192	the water,
001193	
001194	
001195	opened
001196	
001197	
001198	the heavens
001199	
001200	and he saw
001201	
001202	the Spirit
001203	
001204	of God
001205	descending
001206	like
001207	a dove
001208	
001209	and coming
001210	to rest on him.
001211	
001212	
001213	
001214	And a voice
001215	from
001216	
001217	heaven
001218	said,
001219	
001220	“This is
001221	
001222	Son;
001223	
001224	
001225	my one dear
001226	in
001227	him
001228	I take great delight.”
001229	Then
001230	
001231	Jesus
001232	was led
001233	into
001234	
001235	the wilderness
001236	by
001237	
001238	the Spirit
001239	to be tempted
001240	by
001241	
001242	the devil.
001243	
001244	After he fasted
001245	days
001246	forty
001247	
001248	nights
001249	and forty
001250	
001251	he was famished.
001252	
001253	came
001254	
001255	The tempter
001256	and said
001257	
001258	to him, “If
001259	the Son
001260	you are
001261	
001262	of God,
001263	command
001264	
001265	
001266	these stones
001267	
001268	bread.”
001269	to become
001270	
001271	But
001272	he answered,
001273	
001274	“It is written,
001275	does not
001276	by
001277	bread
001278	alone,
001279	live
001280	
001281	‘Man
001282	but
001283	by
001284	every
001285	word
001286	that comes from
001287	
001288	the mouth
001289	of God.’”
001290	Then
001291	took him
001292	
001293	
001294	the devil
001295	to
001296	
001297	the holy
001298	city, had him
001299	
001300	stand
001301	
001302	on
001303	
001304	the highest point
001305	of the
001306	temple,
001307	
001308	and said to him,
001309	
001310	“If
001311	the Son
001312	you are
001313	
001314	of God,
001315	throw
001316	yourself
001317	down.
001318	it is written,
001319	For
001320	
001321	
001322	his angels
001323	
001324	‘He will command
001325	concerning you’
001326	
001327	
001328	and ‘with
001329	their hands
001330	they will lift
001331	you up,
001332	so that you will not
001333	strike
001334	against
001335	a stone.’”
001336	
001337	your foot
001338	
001339	said to him,
001340	
001341	
001342	Jesus
001343	“Once again
001344	it is written:
001345	‘You are not to put
001346	to the test.’”
001347	the Lord
001348	
001349	your God
001350	
001351	Again,
001352	took him
001353	
001354	
001355	the devil
001356	to
001357	mountain,
001358	high
001359	a very
001360	and
001361	showed him
001362	
001363	all
001364	
001365	the kingdoms
001366	of the
001367	world
001368	
001369	
001370	and their grandeur.
001371	
001372	
001373	And he said to him,
001374	
001375	
001376	
001377	all
001378	“I will give you
001379	these things if
001380	you throw yourself to the ground
001381	and worship me.”
001382	
001383	Then
001384	said to him,
001385	
001386	
001387	Jesus
001388	“Go away,
001389	Satan!
001390	it is written:
001391	For
001392	the Lord
001393	
001394	God
001395	your
001396	‘You are to worship
001397	
001398	
001399	only him.’”
001400	and serve
001401	Then
001402	left him,
001403	
001404	
001405	the devil
001406	
001407	
001408	and angels
001409	came
001410	
001411	and began ministering to his needs.
001412	
001413	when Jesus heard
001414	Now
001415	
001416	that John
001417	had been imprisoned,
001418	he went
001419	into
001420	
001421	Galilee.
001422	
001423	While in Galilee, he moved
001424	
001425	from Nazareth
001426	
001427	to make his home
001428	in
001429	Capernaum
001430	
001431	by the sea,
001432	in
001433	the region
001434	of Zebulun
001435	
001436	and Naphtali,
001437	so that
001438	would be fulfilled:
001439	
001440	
001441	by
001442	Isaiah
001443	
001444	the prophet
001445	what was spoken
001446	“Land
001447	of Zebulun
001448	
001449	and land
001450	of Naphtali,
001451	the way
001452	by the sea,
001453	beyond
001454	
001455	the Jordan,
001456	Galilee
001457	
001458	of the Gentiles –
001459	
001460	the people
001461	
001462	who sit
001463	in
001464	darkness
001465	light,
001466	have seen
001467	a great

001470	and on those who sit
001471	in
001472	the region
001473	
001474	and shadow
001475	of death
001476	a light
001477	has dawned.”
001478	
001479	From
001480	that time
001481	began
001482	
001483	Jesus
001484	to preach
001485	
001486	this message:
001487	“Repent,
001488	is near!”
001489	for
001490	
001491	the kingdom
001492	
001493	of heaven
001494	As he was walking

001497	
001498	the Sea
001499	
001500	of Galilee
001501	he saw
001502	two
001503	brothers,
001504	Simon
001505	
001506	(called
001507	Peter)
001508	
001509	and Andrew
001510	
001511	his brother,
001512	
001513	casting
001514	a net
001515	into
001516	
001517	the sea
001518	they were
001519	(for
001520	fishermen).
001521	
001522	He said to them,
001523	
001524	“Follow me,
001525	
001526	
001527	
001528	and I will turn you
001529	
001530	into fishers
001531	of people!”
001532	
001533	
001534	immediately
001535	They left
001536	
001537	their nets
001538	and followed him.
001539	
001540	
001541	Going on
001542	from there
001543	he saw
001544	other

001565	
001566	their nets.
001567	
001568	
001569	Then he called them.
001570	
001571	
001572	
001573	They immediately
001574	left
001575

001577	
001578	
001579	and their father

001619	
001620	People brought to him
001621	
001622	all
001623	
001624	who suffered
001625

002946	“Therefore
002947	I tell you,
002948	
002949	do not
002950	worry
002951	
002952	about your life,
002953	
002954	what
002955	you will eat
002956	or

002961	about your body,

002965	Isn’t
002966	
002967	to life
002968	there more
002969	
002970	
002971	than food
002972	
002973	
002974	and more to the body
002975	
002976	than clothing?
002977	Look at
002978	into
002979	
002980	the birds
002981	
002982	in the sky:
002983	
002984	They do not

002992	
002993	
002994	Father
002995	
002996	
002997	yet your heavenly
002998	feeds them.
002999	
003000	Aren’t you
003001	
003002	more
003003	valuable than they are?
003004	
003005	which
003006	And
003007	of
003008	
003009	you by worrying
003010	can

003015	
003016	hour
003017	even one
003018	
003019	about
003020	clothing?
003021	Why
003022	do you worry
003023	Think
003024	
003025	the flowers
003026	
003027	of the field
003028	about how
003029	grow;
003030	they do not
003031	work
003032	or
003033	spin.
003034	I tell you
003035	Yet
003036	
003037	
003038	that not even
003039	Solomon
003040	in
003041	all
003042	
003043	his glory
003044	
003045	was clothed
003046	like
003047	one of these!
003048	
003049	if
003050	And
003051	
003052	grass,
003053	
003054	the wild
003055	today
003056	which is here
003057	
003058	and tomorrow
003059	into
003060	the fire to heat the oven,
003061	is tossed
003062	
003063	how God
003064	this is
003065	clothes
003066	won’t he clothe you
003067	even
003068	more,
003069	
003070	you people of little faith?
003071	don’t
003072	So then,
003073	worry
003074	saying,
003075	‘What
003076	will we eat?’
003077	or
003078	‘What
003079	will we drink?’
003080	or
003081	‘What
003082	will we wear?’
003083	
003084	For
003085	
003086	
003087	the unconverted
003088	pursue
003089	knows
003090	
003091	
003092	Father
003093	
003094	
003095	these things, and your heavenly
003096	
003097	that you need them.
003098	
003099	
003100	pursue
003101	But
003102	above all
003103	
003104	his kingdom

003110	
003111	
003112	
003113	and all
003114	these things will be given
003115	to you as well.
003116	do not
003117	So then,
003118	worry
003119	about
003120	
003121	tomorrow,
003122	
003123	for

003146	
003147	and the measure
003148	you use
003149	will be the measure you receive.
003150	
003151	Why
003152	
003153	do you see
003154	
003155	the speck

003571	rock.
003572	
003573	Everyone
003574	
003575	who hears
003576	of mine
003577	
003578	these words
003579	
003580	and
003581	does not
003582	do
003583	them
003584	is like
003585	man
003586	a foolish
003587	who
003588	built
003589	
003590	
003591	his house
003592	on
003593	
003594	sand.
003595	
003596	fell,
003597	
003598	The rain
003599	
003600	came,
003601	
003602	the flood
003603	
003604	
003605	
003606	and the winds

003608	beat against
003609	
003610	house,
003611	that
003612	
003613	and it collapsed –
003614	
003615	it was
003616	
003617	destroyed!”
003618	
003619	utterly
003620	
003621	
003622	When
003623	finished
003624	
003625	Jesus
003626	
003627	saying
003628	
003629	were amazed
003630	
003631	these things, the crowds
003632	by
003633	
003634	his teaching,
003635	
003636	
003637	because
003638	he taught them
003639	
003640	like
003641	authority,
003642	one who had
003643	
003644	not
003645	like
003646	
003647	their experts in the law.
003648	
003649	After he came down
003650	
003651	
003652	from
003653	
003654	the mountain,
003655	followed him.
003656	
003657	crowds
003658	large
003659	
003660	
003661	And a leper
003662	approached
003663	and bowed low before him,
003664	
003665	saying,
003666	“Lord,
003667	if
003668	you are willing,
003669	you can
003670	make me
003671	clean.”
003672	
003673	He stretched out
003674	
003675	his hand
003676	and touched him
003677	
003678	saying,
003679	“I am willing.
003680	Be clean!”
003681	
003682	Immediately
003683	was cleansed.
003684	
003685	
003686	his leprosy
003687	
003688	said to him,
003689	
003690	
003691	Then Jesus
003692	“See
003693	that you do not
003694	speak
003695	to anyone, but
003696	go,
003697	yourself
003698	show
003699	
003700	to the priest,
003701	
003702	and bring
003703	
003704	the offering
003705	that
003706	commanded,
003707	Moses
003708	as
003709	a testimony to them.”
003710	
003711	When he entered
003712	
003713	
003714	
003715	Capernaum,
003716	came to him
003717	
003718	a centurion
003719	asking for help:
003720	
003721	
003722	
003723	“Lord,
003724	
003725	my servant
003726	
003727	is lying
003728	at
003729	
003730	home
003731	paralyzed,
003732	in terrible
003733	anguish.”
003734	
003735	Jesus said to him,
003736	
003737	
003738	“I will come
003739	and heal him.”
003740	
003741	
003742	
003743	
003744	But the centurion
003745	replied,
003746	“Lord,
003747	not
003748	I am
003749	worthy
003750	to
003751	
003752	under
003753	
003754	my roof!
003755	have you come
003756	Instead,
003757	just
003758	say
003759	the word
003760	
003761	will be healed.
003762	
003763	and my servant
003764	
003765	
003766	For
003767	
003768	a man
003769	I too am
003770	under
003771	authority,
003772	
003773	under
003774	me.
003775	with soldiers
003776	
003777	I say
003778	
003779	to this one, ‘Go!’
003780	
003781	and he goes,
003782	
003783	and to another
003784	‘Come!’
003785	
003786	and he comes,
003787	
003788	
003789	and to my slave
003790	
003791	‘Do this!’
003792	
003793	
003794	and he does it.”
003795	heard
003796	
003797	
003798	When Jesus
003799	this he was amazed
003800	
003801	him, “I tell you
003802	
003803	to those who followed
003804	the truth,
003805	and said
003806	
003807	
003808	in anyone
003809	such
003810	faith
003811	in
003812	
003813	Israel!
003814	I have not found
003815	I tell you,
003816	
003817	
003818	
003819	many
003820	from
003821	the east
003822	
003823	and west
003824	will come
003825	
003826	to share the banquet
003827	with
003828	Abraham,
003829	
003830	Isaac,
003831	
003832	and Jacob
003833	in
003834	
003835	the kingdom
003836	
003837	of heaven,
003838	
003839	but
003840	the sons
003841	
003842	of the kingdom
003843	will be thrown out
003844	into
003845	
003846	darkness,
003847	
003848	the outer
003849	where there
003850	will be
003851	
003852	weeping
003853	
003854	
003855	and gnashing
003856	
003857	of teeth.”
003858	
003859	said
003860	
003861	Then Jesus
003862	
003863	to the centurion,
003864	“Go;
003865	just as
003866	you believed,
003867	it will be done for you.”
003868	
003869	
003870	was healed
003871	
003872	And the servant
003873	
003874	at
003875	
003876	hour.
003877	that
003878	
003879	entered
003880	
003881	Now when Jesus
003882	
003883	
003884	house,
003885	Peter’s
003886	he saw
003887	
003888	his mother-in-law
003889	
003890	lying down,
003891	
003892	sick with a fever.
003893	
003894	He touched
003895	
003896	her hand,
003897	
003898	
003899	left her.
003900	
003901	
003902	and the fever
003903	
003904	Then she got up
003905	
003906	and began to serve them.
003907	
003908	evening,
003909	
003910	When it was
003911	people were brought to him.
003912	
003913	demon-possessed
003914	many
003915	
003916	He drove out
003917	
003918	the spirits
003919	with a word,
003920	
003921	all
003922	
003923	sick.
003924	who were
003925	and healed
003926	In this way
003927	was fulfilled:
003928	
003929	
003930	by
003931	Isaiah
003932	
003933	the prophet
003934	what was spoken
003935	
003936	
003937	our weaknesses
003938	
003939	“He took
003940	
003941	
003942	our diseases.”
003943	and carried
003944	saw
003945	Now
003946	
003947	when Jesus
003948	a large crowd
003949	around him,
003950	
003951	he gave orders
003952	to go
003953	to
003954	
003955	the other side of the lake.
003956	
003957	came to him
003958	
003959	Then an expert in the law
003960	and said,
003961	
003962	“Teacher,
003963	I will follow you
003964	
003965	wherever
003966	
003967	you go.”
003968	
003969	said to him,
003970	
003971	
003972	Jesus
003973	
003974	“Foxes
003975	dens,
003976	have
003977	
003978	
003979	and the birds
003980	
003981	in the sky
003982	have nests,
003983	
003984	but
003985	the Son
003986	
003987	of Man
003988	no
003989	has
003990	place
003991	
003992	his head.”
003993	to lay
003994	Another
003995	
003996	
003997	of the disciples
003998	
003999	said to him,
004000	
004001	“Lord,
004002	let me
004003	
004004	first
004005	go
004006	
004007	and bury
004008	
004009	my father.”
004010	
004011	
004012	But
004013	Jesus
004014	said to him,
004015	
004016	“Follow
004017	me,
004018	
004019	and let
004020	
004021	the dead
004022	bury
004023	
004024	their own
004025	dead.”
004026	
004027	As he got
004028	
004029	into
004030	
004031	the boat,
004032	followed him.
004033	
004034	
004035	his disciples
004036	
004037	
004038	
004039	storm
004040	And a great
004041	developed
004042	on
004043	
004044	the sea
004045	so that
004046	
004047	the boat.
004048	began to swamp
004049	
004050	
004051	the waves
004052	
004053	But
004054	he was asleep.
004055	
004056	So they came
004057	and woke
004058	him up
004059	saying,
004060	“Lord,
004061	save
004062	us! We are about to die!”
004063	
004064	But he said to them,
004065	
004066	“Why
004067	you cowardly,
004068	are
004069	you people of little faith?”
004070	Then
004071	he got up
004072	and rebuked
004073	
004074	the winds
004075	
004076	
004077	and the sea,
004078	
004079	and it was
004080	calm.
004081	dead
004082	
004083	And
004084	the men
004085	were amazed
004086	and said,
004087	“What sort of person
004088	is this?
004089	
004090	
004091	
004092	
004093	Even the winds
004094	
004095	
004096	and the sea
004097	
004098	obey him!”
004099	
004100	When he came
004101	
004102	to
004103	
004104	the other side,
004105	to
004106	
004107	the region
004108	
004109	of the Gadarenes,
004110	
004111	
004112	two
004113	demon-possessed men
004114	from
004115	
004116	the tombs met him.
004117	coming
004118	violent,
004119	They were extremely
004120	
004121	no
004122	was able
004123	one
004124	to pass
004125	by
004126	that
004127	way.
004128	so that
004129	
004130	
004131	They cried out,
004132	
004133	
004134	
004135	
004136	
004137	“Son
004138	
004139	of God, leave us
004140	alone! Have you come
004141	here
004142	before
004143	the time?”
004144	to torment us
004145	
004146	
004147	
004148	some distance
004149	from them.
004150	
004151	herd
004152	of pigs
004153	A large
004154	was feeding
004155	
004156	Then
004157	the demons
004158	begged him,
004159	
004160	
004161	“If
004162	you drive
004163	us out,
004164	send us
004165	
004166	into
004167	
004168	the herd
004169	
004170	of pigs.”
004171	
004172	And he said,
004173	
004174	“Go!”
004175	
004176	So
004177	they came out
004178	and went
004179	into
004180	
004181	the pigs,
004182	
004183	
004184	rushed
004185	
004186	
004187	and the herd
004188	down
004189	
004190	the steep slope
004191	into
004192	
004193	the lake
004194	
004195	and drowned
004196	in
004197	
004198	the water.
004199	
004200	
004201	The herdsmen
004202	ran off,
004203	
004204	went
004205	into
004206	
004207	the town,
004208	and told
004209	everything
004210	
004211	
004212	
004213	that had happened to the demon-possessed men.
004214	
004215	
004216	Then the entire
004217	
004218	town
004219	came out
004220	to
004221	meet
004222	
004223	Jesus.
004224	
004225	And when they saw him,
004226	
004227	they begged him
004228	to
004229	leave
004230	
004231	
004232	their region.
004233	
004234	
004235	After getting
004236	into
004237	a boat
004238	he crossed
004239	
004240	to the other side and came
004241	to
004242	
004243	his own
004244	town.
004245	
004246	Just then
004247	some people brought to him
004248	
004249	a paralytic
004250	on
004251	a stretcher.
004252	lying
004253	
004254	saw
004255	
004256	When Jesus
004257	
004258	their faith,
004259	
004260	he said
004261	
004262	to the paralytic,
004263	“Have courage,
004264	son!
004265	are forgiven.”
004266	
004267	
004268	Your sins
004269	
004270	
004271	Then some
004272	
004273	of the experts in the law
004274	said
004275	to
004276	themselves,
004277	
004278	“This man is blaspheming!”
004279	
004280	perceived
004281	
004282	When Jesus
004283	
004284	their thoughts
004285	
004286	he said,
004287	“Why
004288	do you respond
004289	with evil
004290	in
004291	
004292	your hearts?
004293	
004294	Which
004295	
004296	is
004297	easier,
004298	to say,
004299	are forgiven’
004300	
004301	
004302	‘Your sins
004303	or
004304	to say,
004305	‘Stand up
004306	
004307	and walk’?
004308	so that
004309	But
004310	you may know
004311	
004312	authority
004313	has
004314	
004315	that the Son
004316	
004317	of Man
004318	on
004319	
004320	earth
004321	to forgive
004322	sins” –
004323	then
004324	he said
004325	
004326	to the paralytic –
004327	“Stand up,
004328	take
004329	
004330	
004331	your stretcher,
004332	
004333	and go
004334	
004335	
004336	home.”
004337	
004338	
004339	So he stood up
004340	and went
004341	
004342	
004343	home.
004344	
004345	saw
004346	
004347	
004348	When the crowd
004349	this, they were afraid
004350	
004351	and honored
004352	
004353	God
004354	
004355	who had given
004356	authority
004357	such
004358	
004359	to men.
004360	
004361	
004362	
004363	As Jesus
004364	went on from there,
004365	he saw
004366	a man
004367	sitting
004368	at
004369	
004370	the tax booth.
004371	Matthew
004372	named
004373	
004374	he said to him.
004375	
004376	“Follow me,”
004377	
004378	
004379	So he got up
004380	and followed him.
004381	
004382	As
004383	
004384	Jesus
004385	was having a meal
004386	in
004387	
004388	Matthew’s house,
004389	
004390	
004391	many
004392	tax collectors
004393	
004394	and sinners
004395	came
004396	and ate
004397	
004398	with Jesus
004399	
004400	
004401	and his disciples.
004402	
004403	
004404	saw
004405	
004406	When the Pharisees
004407	this they said
004408	
004409	to his disciples,
004410	
004411	
004412	
004413	with
004414	
004415	tax collectors
004416	
004417	and sinners?”
004418	eat
004419	
004420	teacher
004421	“Why does your
004422	
004423	
004424	When Jesus heard
004425	this he said,
004426	
004427	don’t need
004428	those who are
004429	
004430	“Those who are healthy
004431	a physician,
004432	but
004433	
004434	sick do.
004435	
004436	Go
004437	
004438	and learn
004439	what
004440	this saying means:
004441	mercy
004442	‘I want
004443	
004444	and not
004445	sacrifice.’
004446	I did not
004447	For
004448	come
004449	to call
004450	the righteous,
004451	but
004452	sinners.”
004453	Then
004454	came
004455	
004456	
004457	disciples
004458	John’s
004459	to Jesus and asked,
004460	
004461	“Why
004462	
004463	
004464	
004465	do we and the Pharisees
004466	fast
004467	often,
004468	
004469	but
004470	your disciples
004471	
004472	don’t
004473	fast?”
004474	
004475	said to them,
004476	
004477	
004478	
004479	Jesus
004480	cannot
004481	
004482	guests

004484	“The wedding

004495	the days
004496	when

004498	from them,
004499	
004500	
004501	the bridegroom
004502	
004503	and then
004504	they will fast.
004505	No one

004545	
004546	and the skins
004547	are destroyed.
004548	Instead
004549	they put

004556	and both

004558	
004559	
004560	As he was saying
004561	
004562	
004563	leader
004564	these things, a
004565	came,
004566	bowed low before him,
004567	
004568	and said,
004569	
004570	
004571	“My daughter
004572	
004573	has just
004574	died,

004578	
004579	your hand
004580	
004581	on her
004582	
004583	
004584	and she will live.”
004585	
004586	got up
004587	
004588	Jesus
004589	and followed him.
004590	
004591	
004592	
004593	and his disciples
004594	
004595	
004596	
004597	But a woman
004598	who had been suffering from a hemorrhage
004599	for twelve
004600	years
004601	came up
004602	behind
004603	him and touched
004604	
004605	the edge
004606	
004607	of his cloak.
004608	
004609	she kept saying
004610	For
004611	to
004612	herself,
004613	“If
004614	only
004615	I touch
004616	
004617	his cloak,
004618	
004619	I will be healed.”
004620	
004621	But
004622	when Jesus
004623	turned
004624	
004625	and saw her
004626	
004627	he said,
004628	“Have courage,
004629	daughter!
004630	
004631	Your faith
004632	
004633	has made you well.”
004634	
004635	
004636	was healed
004637	
004638	And the woman
004639	from
004640	
004641	hour.
004642	that
004643	
004644	entered

004648	
004649	house
004650	
004651	the leader’s
004652	
004653	and saw
004654	
004655	the flute players
004656	
004657	
004658	crowd,
004659	and the disorderly
004660	he said,
004661	“Go away,
004662	is not
004663	for
004664	dead
004665	
004666	the girl
004667	but
004668	asleep!”
004669	
004670	And they began making fun of him.
004671	
004672	when
004673	But
004674	had been forced outside,
004675	
004676	the crowd
004677	he went in
004678	and gently took her
004679	
004680	by the hand,
004681	
004682	
004683	got up.
004684	
004685	and the girl
004686	
004687	of this spread
004688	
004689	And the news
004690	
004691	throughout
004692	
004693	
004694	region.
004695	that
004696	
004697	went on
004698	from there,
004699	
004700	As Jesus
004701	began to follow him,
004702	
004703	two
004704	blind men
004705	shouting,
004706	
004707	
004708	“Have mercy
004709	on us,
004710	Son
004711	of David!”
004712	When he went
004713	
004714	into
004715	
004716	the house,
004717	came to him.
004718	
004719	
004720	the blind men
004721	
004722	said to them,
004723	
004724	
004725	Jesus
004726	“Do you believe
004727	
004728	that I am able
004729	
004730	to do this?”
004731	They said to him,
004732	
004733	“Yes,
004734	Lord.”
004735	Then
004736	he touched
004737	
004738	their eyes
004739	
004740	saying,
004741	according to
004742	
004743	your faith.”
004744	
004745	“Let it be done for you
004746	
004747	
004748	were opened.
004749	
004750	
004751	And their eyes
004752	
004753	sternly warned them,
004754	
004755	
004756	Then Jesus
004757	
004758	“See that
004759	no one
004760	knows about this!”
004761	
004762	But
004763	they went out
004764	and spread the news about him
004765	
004766	throughout
004767	entire
004768	
004769	region.
004770	that
004771	
004772	
004773	As they were going away,
004774	
004775	was brought to him.
004776	
004777	a man
004778	and unable to speak
004779	who was demon-possessed
004780	
004781	was cast out,
004782	
004783	After the demon
004784	began to speak.
004785	
004786	the man who had been mute
004787	
004788	were amazed
004789	
004790	The crowds
004791	and said,
004792	“Never
004793	been seen
004794	has anything like this
004795	in
004796	
004797	Israel!”
004798	
004799	But
004800	the Pharisees
004801	said,
004802	“By
004803	
004804	the ruler
004805	
004806	of demons
004807	he casts out
004808	
004809	demons!”
004810	
004811	went throughout
004812	
004813	Then Jesus
004814	
004815	the towns
004816	all
004817	
004818	
004819	and villages,
004820	teaching
004821	in
004822	
004823	their synagogues,
004824	
004825	
004826	preaching
004827	
004828	the good news
004829	
004830	of the kingdom,
004831	
004832	and healing
004833	every kind
004834	of disease
004835	
004836	
004837	and sickness.
004838	When he saw
004839	
004840	
004841	the crowds,
004842	he had compassion
004843	on them
004844	
004845	
004846	because they were
004847	bewildered
004848	
004849	and helpless,
004850	like
004851	sheep
004852	without
004853	
004854	a shepherd.
004855	Then
004856	he said
004857	
004858	to his disciples,
004859	
004860	
004861	
004862	“The harvest
004863	is plentiful,
004864	
004865	but
004866	the workers
004867	are few.
004868	ask
004869	Therefore
004870	
004871	the Lord
004872	
004873	of the harvest
004874	
004875	to send out
004876	workers
004877	into
004878	
004879	his harvest-ready fields.”
004880	
004881	
004882	Jesus called
004883	
004884	his twelve
004885	disciples
004886	
004887	and gave them
004888	
004889	authority
004890	spirits
004891	over unclean
004892	so
004893	they could cast
004894	them out
004895	
004896	and heal
004897	every kind
004898	of disease
004899	
004900	
004901	and sickness.
004902	
004903	Now
004904	of the twelve
004905	apostles:
004906	
004907	the names
004908	these are
004909	
004910	first,
004911	Simon
004912	
004913	(called
004914	Peter),
004915	
004916	and Andrew
004917	
004918	his brother;
004919	
004920	
004921	James
004922	
004923	
004924	son of Zebedee
004925	
004926	and John
004927	
004928	his brother;
004929	
004930	Philip
004931	
004932	and Bartholomew;
004933	Thomas
004934	
004935	and Matthew
004936	
004937	the tax collector;
004938	James
004939	
004940	
004941	the son of Alphaeus,
004942	
004943	and Thaddaeus;
004944	Simon
004945	the
004946	Zealot
004947	
004948	and Judas
004949	
004950	Iscariot,
004951	
004952	
004953	who betrayed him.
004954	
004955	
004956	
004957	these twelve,
004958	sent out
004959	
004960	Jesus
004961	instructing them
004962	
004963	as follows:
004964	that leads to
004965	on a road
004966	Gentile
004967	“Do not
004968	go
004969	
004970	
004971	town.
004972	any Samaritan
004973	regions and do not
004974	enter
004975	Go
004976	
004977	instead
004978	to
004979	
004980	sheep
004981	
004982	the lost
004983	of the house
004984	of Israel.
004985	As you go,

005701	into
005702	
005703	the wilderness

005710	What

005713	A man

005716	dressed
005717	Look,
005718	
005719	
005720	soft clothing
005721	those who wear

005726	of kings!
005727	
005728	
005729	What
005730	did you go out
005731	to see?
005732	A prophet?
005733	Yes,
005734	I tell you,
005735	
005736	
005737	and more
005738	than a prophet!
005739	
005740	This is
005741	the one about
005742	whom
005743	it is written:
005744	‘Look,
005745	
005746	I am sending
005747	
005748	my messenger
005749

005756	your way
005757	
005758	before you.’
005759	
005760	the truth,
005761	“I tell you
005762	
005763	no
005764	one has arisen
005765	among
005766	those born
005767	of women,
005768	greater
005769	than John
005770	
005771	the Baptist.
005772	
005773	Yet
005774	the one who is least
005775	in
005776	
005777	the kingdom
005778	
005779	of heaven
005780	is greater
005781	than he
005782	is!
005783	From
005784	
005785	
005786	the days
005787	of John
005788	
005789	the Baptist

005791	now
005792	
005793	the kingdom
005794	
005795	of heaven
005796	has suffered violence,
005797	
005798	and forceful people
005799	lay hold of it.
005800	
005801	all
005802	For
005803	
005804	the prophets

005807	and the law
005808	until
005809	John appeared.
005810	prophesied
005811	
005812	And if
005813	you are willing
005814	to accept
005815	
005816	it, he is
005817	Elijah,
005818	
005819	who is
005820	to come.
005821	
005822	The one who has
005823	ears
005824	had better listen!
005825	“To what
005826	
005827	should I compare
005828	
005829	this generation?
005830	
005831	like
005832	They are
005833	children
005834	sitting
005835	in
005836	
005837	the marketplaces
005838	who
005839	call out
005840	
005841	to one another,
005842	
005843	‘We played the flute
005844	for you,
005845	
005846	yet you did not
005847	dance;
005848	we wailed in mourning,
005849	
005850	yet you did not
005851	weep.’
005852	came
005853	For
005854	John
005855	neither
005856	eating
005857	nor
005858	drinking,
005859	
005860	and they say,
005861	a demon!’
005862	‘He has

005874	him,
005875	a glutton

005886	by
005887	
005888	her deeds.”
005889	
005890	Then
005891	Jesus began
005892	to criticize openly
005893	
005894	the cities
005895	in
005896	which
005897	he had done
005898	
005899	many
005900	of his miracles,
005901	
005902	
005903	because they did not
005904	repent.
005905	“Woe to you,
005906	
005907	Chorazin!
005908	Woe to you,

005919	the miracles

005926	in
005927	sackcloth
005928	
005929	and ashes.
005930	they would have repented
005931	But
005932	I tell you,
005933	
005934	for Tyre
005935	
005936	and Sidon
005937	more bearable
005938	it will be
005939	on
005940	the day
005941	of judgment
005942	than for you!
005943	
005944	
005945	
005946	And you, Capernaum,
005947	No,
005948	to
005949	heaven?
005950	will you be exalted
005951	to
005952	Hades!
005953	you will be thrown down

005966	
005967	to
005968	
005969	this day.
005970	But
005971	I tell you,
005972	
005973	
005974	for the region
005975	of Sodom

005977	it will be
005978	on
005979	the day

005982	
005983	At
005984	that
005985	
005986	time
005987	
005988	
005989	Jesus
005990	said,
005991	“I praise you,
005992	
005993	Father,

006002	these things

006004	the wise
006005	
006006	and intelligent,
006007	
006008	and have revealed them
006009	
006010	to little children.
006011	Yes,
006012	
006013	Father,
006014	
006015	for this
006016	your gracious will.
006017	was

006021	
006022	have been handed over to me

006024	
006025	my Father.

006047	and anyone
006048	decides
006049	
006050	the Son
006051	to reveal him.
006052	Come
006053	to me,
006054	
006055	all
006056	
006057	you who are weary
006058	
006059	and burdened,
006060	and I
006061	will give you rest.
006062	
006063	Take

006065	my yoke

006084	for your souls.
006085	
006086	
006087	For

006090	easy to bear,
006091	
006092	
006093	and my load
006094	
006095	is not hard to carry.”
006096	is
006097	At
006098	that
006099	
006100	time
006101	went
006102	
006103	Jesus
006104	
006105	on a Sabbath.
006106	through
006107	
006108	the grain fields
006109	
006110	
006111	His disciples
006112	
006113	were hungry,
006114	
006115	and they began
006116	to pick
006117	heads of wheat
006118	
006119	and eat them.
006120	
006121	But
006122	when the Pharisees
006123	saw
006124	this they said to him,
006125	
006126	“Look,
006127	
006128	your disciples
006129	
006130	are doing
006131	what
006132	is against
006133	the law
006134	to do
006135	on
006136	the Sabbath.”
006137	
006138	
006139	He said to them,
006140	
006141	“Haven’t
006142	you read
006143	what
006144	did
006145	David
006146	when
006147	were hungry –
006148	
006149	
006150	he and his companions
006151	
006152	how
006153	he entered
006154	
006155	
006156	the house
006157	
006158	of God
006159

006161	bread,
006162	
006163	the sacred
006164	and they ate
006165	which
006166	against
006167	the law for him
006168	was
006169	
006170	to eat,
006171	or
006172	
006173	his companions
006174	
006175	
006176	but
006177	
006178	for the priests?
006179	only
006180	Or
006181	have you not
006182	read
006183	in
006184	
006185	the law
006186	
006187	
006188	the Sabbath
006189	
006190	that the priests
006191	in
006192	
006193	the temple
006194	
006195	
006196	desecrate
006197	
006198	not guilty?
006199	and yet are
006200	I tell you
006201	
006202	
006203	
006204	
006205	than the temple
006206	that something greater
006207	is
006208	here.
006209	If
006210	
006211	you had known
006212	what
006213	this means:
006214	mercy
006215	‘I want
006216	
006217	and not
006218	sacrifice,’
006219	you would not
006220	
006221	have condemned
006222	
006223	the innocent.
006224	lord
006225	For
006226	is
006227	
006228	of the Sabbath.”
006229	
006230	the Son
006231	
006232	of Man
006233	
006234	Then Jesus left
006235	that place
006236	
006237	and entered
006238	
006239	their synagogue.
006240	
006241	
006242	was there
006243	A man
006244	hand.
006245	who had
006246	a withered
006247	
006248	And they asked
006249	
006250	
006251	
006252	Jesus, “Is it lawful
006253	
006254	on the Sabbath?”
006255	to heal
006256	so that
006257	they could accuse him.
006258	
006259	
006260	
006261	He said to them,
006262	
006263	“Would
006264	
006265	of you,
006266	
006267	one
006268	
006269	if he had
006270	sheep
006271	one
006272	
006273	
006274	that fell
006275	
006276	
006277	on the Sabbath,
006278	into
006279	a pit
006280	not any
006281	take hold
006282	of it
006283	
006284	and lift it out?
006285	How much more
006286	
006287	valuable
006288	is a person
006289	than a sheep!
006290	So
006291	it is lawful
006292	
006293	on the Sabbath.”
006294	good
006295	to do
006296	Then
006297	he said
006298	
006299	to the man,
006300	“Stretch out
006301	
006302	
006303	your hand.”
006304	
006305	He stretched it out
006306	
006307	and it was restored,
006308	as healthy
006309	as
006310	the
006311	other.
006312	went out
006313	But
006314	
006315	the Pharisees
006316	
006317	and plotted
006318	against him,
006319	
006320	as to how
006321	
006322	they could assassinate him.
006323	
006324	Now
006325	when Jesus
006326	learned
006327	of this, he went away
006328	from there.
006329	
006330	followed him,
006331	
006332	crowds
006333	Great
006334	
006335	and he healed them
006336	
006337	all.
006338	
006339	But he sternly warned them
006340	
006341	to
006342	not
006343	known.
006344	
006345	make him
006346	This
006347	fulfilled
006348	
006349	
006350	by
006351	Isaiah:
006352	
006353	the prophet
006354	what was spoken
006355	“Here
006356	
006357	is my servant
006358	I
006359	whom
006360	I have chosen,
006361	
006362	
006363	
006364	
006365	the one I love, in whom
006366	take great delight.
006367	
006368	
006369	
006370	I will put
006371	
006372	my Spirit
006373	
006374	on him,
006375	
006376	
006377	justice
006378	
006379	to the nations.
006380	and he will proclaim
006381	He will not
006382	quarrel
006383	or
006384	cry out,
006385	nor
006386	hear
006387	will anyone

006400	a smoldering
006401	
006402	or extinguish
006403	until
006404	
006405	he brings
006406	to
006407	victory.
006408	
006409	justice
006410	
006411	
006412	And in his name
006413	
006414	the Gentiles
006415	will hope.”
006416	Then
006417	they brought to him
006418	
006419	a demon-possessed man
006420	who was blind
006421	
006422	and mute.
006423	
006424	Jesus healed him
006425	
006426	so that
006427	
006428	
006429	he could speak
006430	
006431	and see.
006432	
006433	were amazed
006434	All
006435	
006436	the crowds
006437	
006438	and said,
006439	
006440	
006441	“Could this one be
006442	
006443	the Son
006444	of David?”
006445	
006446	But
006447	when the Pharisees
006448	heard
006449	this they said,
006450	
006451	“He does not
006452	cast out
006453	
006454	demons
006455	
006456	except
006457	by
006458	
006459	the power of Beelzebul,
006460	the ruler
006461	
006462	of demons!”
006463	when Jesus realized
006464	Now
006465	
006466	what they were thinking,
006467	
006468	he said to them,
006469	
006470	“Every
006471	kingdom
006472	divided
006473	against
006474	itself
006475	is destroyed,
006476	
006477	
006478	town
006479	or
006480	house
006481	divided
006482	against
006483	itself
006484	and no
006485	will stand.
006486	
006487	So if
006488	
006489	Satan
006490	
006491	Satan,
006492	casts out
006493	against
006494	himself.
006495	he is divided
006496	How
006497	then
006498	stand?
006499	
006500	will his kingdom
006501	
006502	
006503	And if
006504	
006505	by
006506	Beelzebul,
006507	I cast out
006508	
006509	demons
006510	
006511	do your sons
006512	
006513	by
006514	whom
006515	cast them out?
006516	For
006517	this reason
006518	they
006519	your judges.
006520	will be
006521	
006522	if
006523	But
006524	by
006525	the Spirit
006526	of God,
006527	
006528	I cast out
006529	
006530	demons
006531	then
006532	has already overtaken you.
006533	
006534	
006535	
006536	the kingdom
006537	
006538	of God
006539	else
006540	How
006541	can
006542	someone
006543	enter
006544	
006545	
006546	house
006547	
006548	a strong man’s
006549	
006550	
006551	his property,
006552	
006553	and steal
006554	
006555	unless
006556	he first
006557	ties up
006558	
006559	the strong man?
006560	
006561	Then
006562	
006563	the house.
006564	
006565	he can thoroughly plunder
006566	
006567	not
006568	Whoever is
006569	with me
006570	
006571	against me,
006572	
006573	is
006574	
006575	
006576	and whoever does not
006577	gather
006578	with me
006579	
006580	scatters.
006581	For
006582	
006583	this reason I tell you,
006584	
006585	for every
006586	sin
006587	
006588	and blasphemy,
006589	will be forgiven

006738	a sign

006842	and now,
006843	something greater

006846	“When

006848	
006849	an unclean

006864	Then
006865	it says,
006866	to
006867	
006868	the home

006875	it finds
006876	the house empty,
006877	swept clean,
006878	
006879	and put in order.
006880	Then
006881	it goes
006882	
006883	and brings

006886	seven

006909	generation as well!”
006910	
006911	
006912	for this evil
006913	While Jesus was still
006914	
006915	speaking
006916	
006917	to the crowds,
006918	
006919	
006920	his mother
006921	
006922	
006923	and brothers

006925	came and stood
006926	outside,
006927	asking
006928	
006929	to speak to him.
006930	told him,
006931	
006932	Someone
006933	
006934	“Look,
006935	
006936	your mother

006945	
006946	to speak to you.”
006947	
006948	
006949	this, Jesus replied,
006950	
006951	
006952	To the one who had said
006953	
006954	“Who
006955	is

006957	my mother

006964	
006965	
006966	And pointing

006968	
006969	
006970	toward
006971	
006972	his disciples

007003	On
007004	
007005	day
007006	that
007007	went out
007008	
007009	after Jesus
007010	
007011	of the house,
007012	he sat
007013	by
007014	
007015	the lake.
007016	
007017	gathered
007018	around him

007023	
007024	into
007025	a boat
007026	he got
007027	to sit
007028	while
007029	the whole
007030	
007031	crowd
007032	on
007033	
007034	the shore.
007035	stood
007036	
007037	He told them
007038	
007039	many things
007040	in
007041	parables,
007042	saying:
007043	“Listen!

007046	A sower
007047	
007048	to sow.
007049	
007050	And as
007051	
007052	he sowed,
007053	
007054	some
007055	
007056	seeds fell
007057	along
007058	
007059	the path,
007060	
007061	came
007062	
007063	and the birds
007064	and devoured them.
007065	
007066	Other
007067	
007068	seeds fell
007069	on

007078	quickly
007079	They sprang up

007091	and because
007092	
007093	they did not
007094	have
007095	sufficient root,
007096	they withered.
007097	Other
007098	
007099	seeds fell
007100	among
007101	
007102	the thorns,

007104	and they grew up

007123	a hundred times as much,
007124	some
007125	
007126	sixty,
007127	and some
007128	
007129	thirty.
007130	
007131	The one who has
007132	ears
007133	had better listen!”
007134	
007135	came to him
007136	
007137	Then the disciples
007138	and said,
007139	
007140	
007141	“Why
007142	in
007143	parables?”
007144	do you speak to them
007145	
007146	
007147	
007148	He replied,
007149	
007150	
007151	
007152	
007153	“You have been given
007154	the opportunity to know
007155	
007156	the secrets
007157	
007158	of the kingdom
007159	
007160	of heaven,
007161	
007162	but
007163	not.
007164	they have
007165	whoever
007166	For
007167	has
007168	will be given more,
007169	
007170	
007171	and will have an abundance.
007172	whoever
007173	But
007174	does not
007175	have,
007176	
007177	even what
007178	he has
007179	will be taken
007180	from him.
007181	
007182	For
007183	
007184	in
007185	parables:
007186	
007187	this reason I speak to them
007188	
007189	Although they see
007190	they do not
007191	see,
007192	
007193	and although they hear
007194	they do not
007195	hear
007196	nor
007197	do they understand.
007198	
007199	is fulfilled
007200	
007201	
007202	And concerning them the prophecy
007203	of Isaiah
007204	
007205	that says:
007206	carefully
007207	‘You will listen
007208	
007209	
007210	yet will never
007211	understand,
007212	
007213	you will look
007214	closely
007215	yet
007216	
007217	will never
007218	comprehend.
007219	has become dull;
007220	For
007221	
007222	the heart
007223	
007224	of this people
007225	
007226	
007227	
007228	of hearing,
007229	they are hard
007230	and hear
007231	
007232	
007233	their eyes,
007234	
007235	and they have shut
007236	so that they would not
007237	see
007238	
007239	with their eyes
007240	
007241	
007242	with their ears
007243	
007244	
007245	
007246	with their hearts
007247	and understand
007248	
007249	and turn,
007250	
007251	and I would heal them.’
007252	
007253	
007254	“But
007255	are blessed
007256	
007257	your eyes
007258	
007259	because they see,
007260	
007261	
007262	and your ears
007263	
007264	
007265	because they hear.
007266	the truth,
007267	For
007268	I tell you
007269	
007270	
007271	many
007272	prophets
007273	
007274	and righteous people
007275	longed
007276	to see
007277	what
007278	you see
007279	
007280	but did not
007281	see it,
007282	
007283	and to hear
007284	what
007285	you hear
007286	
007287	but did not
007288	hear it.
007289	
007290	“So
007291	listen
007292	
007293	to the parable
007294	
007295	of the sower:
007296	When anyone
007297	hears
007298	
007299	the word
007300	
007301	about the kingdom
007302	
007303	and does not
007304	understand it,
007305	comes
007306	the
007307	evil one
007308	
007309	and snatches
007310	
007311	what was sown
007312	in
007313	
007314	his heart;
007315	
007316	
007317	this is
007318	
007319	along
007320	
007321	the path.
007322	the seed sown

007335	
007336	and immediately
007337	with
007338	joy.
007339	receives it

007343	But
007344	root
007345	in

007348	not endure;

007351	
007352	when trouble

007355	because
007356	
007357	of the word,
007358	immediately
007359	he falls away.
007360	
007361	
007362	among
007363	
007364	thorns
007365	The seed sown

007407	yielding
007408	
007409	
007410	a hundred,
007411	
007412	
007413	sixty,
007414	
007415	
007416	or thirty times what was sown.”
007417	with another
007418	parable:
007419	He presented them
007420	
007421	
007422	is like
007423	
007424	“The kingdom
007425	
007426	of heaven
007427	a person
007428	who sowed
007429	good
007430	seed
007431	in
007432	
007433	his field.
007434	
007435	while
007436	But
007437	
007438	was sleeping,
007439	
007440	everyone
007441	came
007442	
007443	
007444	an enemy
007445	
007446	and sowed
007447	darnel
007448	
007449	among
007450	
007451	the wheat
007452	
007453	and went away.
007454	When
007455	
007456	sprouted
007457	
007458	the plants
007459	
007460	grain,
007461	and produced
007462	then
007463	also appeared.
007464	
007465	
007466	the darnel
007467	came
007468	So
007469	
007470	the slaves
007471	
007472	of the landowner
007473	and said to him,
007474	
007475	‘Sir,
007476	didn’t
007477	good
007478	seed
007479	you sow
007480	in
007481	
007482	your
007483	field?
007484	where
007485	Then
007486	come from?’
007487	did the darnel
007488	
007489	
007490	He said,
007491	
007492	‘An enemy
007493	
007494	
007495	has done this!’
007496	
007497	So
007498	the slaves
007499	replied,
007500	
007501	‘Do you want
007502	
007503	us to go
007504	and gather it?’
007505	
007506	
007507	But
007508	he said,
007509	‘No,
007510	since
007511	in gathering
007512	
007513	the darnel
007514	you may uproot
007515	along with it.
007516	
007517	
007518	the wheat
007519	Let
007520	grow together
007521	both
007522	until
007523	
007524	the harvest.
007525	
007526	At
007527	time
007528	
007529	harvest
007530	I will tell
007531	
007532	the reapers,
007533	collect
007534	“First
007535	
007536	the darnel
007537	
007538	and tie it
007539	
007540	in
007541	bundles
007542	to
007543	
007544	be burned,
007545	
007546	
007547	but
007548	the wheat
007549	then gather
007550	into
007551	
007552	my barn.”’”
007553	
007554	another
007555	parable:
007556	He gave them
007557	
007558	
007559	like
007560	is
007561	
007562	“The kingdom
007563	
007564	of heaven
007565	
007566	a mustard seed
007567	that
007568	took
007569	a man
007570	and sowed
007571	in
007572	
007573	his field.
007574	
007575	
007576	the smallest
007577	
007578	It is
007579	of all
007580	
007581	the seeds,
007582	when
007583	but
007584	it has grown
007585	the greatest
007586	
007587	garden plant
007588	it is
007589	
007590	and becomes
007591	a tree,
007592	so that
007593	come
007594	
007595	birds
007596	
007597	the wild
007598	
007599	and nest
007600	in
007601	
007602	its branches.”
007603	
007604	another
007605	parable:
007606	He told them
007607	
007608	like
007609	is
007610	
007611	“The kingdom
007612	
007613	of heaven
007614	yeast
007615	that
007616	took
007617	a woman
007618	and mixed
007619	with
007620	of flour
007621	measures
007622	three
007623	until
007624	
007625	the dough had risen.”
007626	all
007627	
007628	all
007629	spoke
007630	
007631	Jesus
007632	these things in
007633	parables
007634	
007635	to the crowds;
007636	
007637	without
007638	a parable.
007639	he did not
007640	speak to them
007641	
007642	This
007643	fulfilled
007644	
007645	what was spoken
007646	by
007647	
007648	the prophet:
007649	
007650	“I will open
007651	in
007652	parables,
007653	
007654	my mouth
007655	
007656	I will announce
007657	what has been hidden
007658	from
007659	the foundation
007660	of the world.”
007661	Then
007662	he left
007663	
007664	the crowds
007665	and went
007666	into
007667	
007668	the house.
007669	
007670	came to him
007671	
007672	
007673	And his disciples
007674	
007675	saying,
007676	“Explain to us
007677	
007678	
007679	the parable
007680	
007681	of the darnel
007682	
007683	in the field.”
007684	
007685	
007686	He answered,
007687	
007688	
007689	“The one who sowed
007690	
007691	the good
007692	seed

007713	of the kingdom.
007714	
007715	
007716	The poisonous weeds

007718	
007719	the people
007720	
007721	of the evil one,

007723	and
007724	the enemy
007725	
007726	who sows them
007727	
007728	is

007738	and
007739	the reapers
007740	are angels.
007741	
007742	As
007743	
007744	are collected
007745	
007746	the poisonous weeds
007747	
007748	with fire,
007749	and burned
007750	so
007751	it will be
007752	at
007753	
007754	the end
007755	
007756	of the age.
007757	will send

007776	
007777	
007778	as well as all lawbreakers.
007779	
007780	They will throw them
007781	
007782	into

007793	and gnashing

007795	of teeth.
007796	Then
007797	
007798	the righteous
007799	will shine
007800	like
007801

007805	the kingdom
007806	
007807	of their Father.
007808	
007809	
007810	The one who has
007811	ears
007812	had better listen!
007813	like
007814	is
007815	“The
007816	kingdom

007818	of heaven
007819	a treasure,

007823	a field,

007825	found
007826	a person
007827	and hid.
007828	
007829	Then because of
007830	
007831	joy
007832	
007833	he went
007834	
007835	and sold

007837	all that
007838	he had
007839	
007840	and bought
007841	
007842	field.
007843	that
007844	“Again,
007845	like
007846	is
007847	
007848	the kingdom
007849	
007850	of heaven
007851	
007852	a merchant
007853	searching
007854	for fine
007855	pearls.
007856	When he found
007857	
007858	a
007859	of great value,
007860	pearl
007861	he went out
007862	and sold
007863	everything
007864	
007865	he had
007866	
007867	and bought it.
007868	
007869	“Again,
007870	like
007871	is
007872	
007873	the kingdom
007874	
007875	of heaven
007876	a net
007877	that was cast
007878	into
007879	
007880	the sea
007881	
007882	
007883	all
007884	kinds of fish.
007885	that caught
007886	it was
007887	When
007888	full,
007889	they pulled
007890	
007891	
007892	it ashore,
007893	
007894	sat down,
007895	and put
007896	
007897	the good
007898	fish into
007899	containers
007900	
007901	and
007902	the bad
007903	away.
007904	threw
007905	this way
007906	It will be
007907	at
007908	
007909	the end
007910	
007911	of the age.
007912	will come
007913	
007914	Angels
007915	
007916	and separate
007917	
007918	the evil
007919	from
007920	
007921	
007922	the righteous
007923	
007924	and throw them
007925	
007926	into
007927	
007928	furnace,
007929	
007930	the fiery
007931	where there
007932	will be
007933	
007934	weeping
007935	
007936	
007937	and gnashing
007938	
007939	of teeth.
007940	“Have you understood
007941	
007942	all
007943	these things?” They replied,
007944	
007945	“Yes.”
007946	
007947	
007948	Then he said to them,
007949	
007950	
007951	“Therefore
007952	every
007953	expert in the law
007954	who has been trained
007955	
007956	for the kingdom
007957	
007958	of heaven
007959	like
007960	is
007961	
007962	the owner of a house
007963	who
007964	brings out
007965	of
007966	
007967	his treasure
007968	
007969	what is new
007970	
007971	and old.”
007972	
007973	
007974	Now when
007975	finished
007976	
007977	Jesus
007978	
007979	these parables,
007980	
007981	he moved on
007982	from there.
007983	
007984	Then he came
007985	to
007986	
007987	his hometown
007988	
007989	and began to teach
007990	
007991	the people in
007992	
007993	their synagogue.
007994	
007995	
007996	They were astonished
007997	
007998	
007999	and said,
008000	“Where
008001	
008002	
008003	did this man get such wisdom
008004	
008005	
008006	
008007	and miraculous powers?
008008	Isn’t
008009	
008010	
008011	
008012	
008013	this the carpenter’s
008014	son?
008015	Isn’t
008016	
008017	his mother
008018	
008019	named
008020	Mary?
008021	
008022	
008023	And aren’t his brothers
008024	
008025	James,
008026	
008027	Joseph,
008028	
008029	Simon,
008030	
008031	and Judas?
008032	
008033	
008034	his sisters
008035	
008036	And aren’t
008037	all
008038	here with us?
008039	
008040	
008041	where
008042	So
008043	
008044	
008045	did he get all this?”
008046	
008047	And so they took offense
008048	at him.
008049	
008050	
008051	But
008052	Jesus
008053	said to them,
008054	
008055	not
008056	is
008057	“A prophet
008058	without honor
008059	
008060	except
008061	in
008062	
008063	his hometown
008064	
008065	and in
008066	
008067	his own house.”
008068	
008069	
008070	And he did not
008071	do
008072	there
008073	miracles
008074	many
008075	because of
008076	
008077	their unbelief.
008078	
008079	At
008080	that
008081	
008082	time
008083	heard
008084	Herod
008085	
008086	the tetrarch
008087	
008088	reports
008089	about Jesus,
008090	
008091	and he said
008092	
008093	to his servants,
008094	
008095	
008096	“This is
008097	John
008098	
008099	the Baptist.
008100	
008101	He has been raised
008102	from
008103	
008104	the dead!
008105	
008106	And because of
008107	
008108	
008109	this, miraculous powers
008110	are at work
008111	in him.”
008112	
008113	
008114	For
008115	Herod
008116	had arrested
008117	
008118	John,
008119	bound him,
008120	
008121	
008122	him in
008123	prison
008124	and put
008125	on account of
008126	Herodias,
008127	
008128	wife,
008129	Philip’s
008130	
008131	his brother
008132	
008133	had repeatedly told him,
008134	because
008135	
008136	John
008137	
008138	“It is not
008139	lawful
008140	
008141	for you to have her.”
008142	
008143	
008144	Although Herod wanted
008145	
008146	to kill
008147	John, he feared
008148	
008149	the crowd
008150	
008151	John as
008152	a prophet.
008153	
008154	because they accepted
008155	birthday,
008156	But
008157	
008158	
008159	on Herod’s
008160	danced
008161	
008162	the daughter
008163	
008164	of Herodias
008165	
008166	
008167	before
008168	
008169	them and pleased
008170	
008171	Herod,
008172	so much that
008173	with
008174	an oath
008175	he promised
008176	
008177	to give her
008178	whatever
008179	
008180	she asked.
008181	
008182	
008183	Instructed
008184	by her
008185	
008186	mother,
008187	
008188	“Give me
008189	
008190	she said,
008191	here
008192	on
008193	a platter.”
008194	
008195	the head
008196	of John
008197	
008198	the Baptist
008199	
008200	Although it grieved
008201	
008202	the king,
008203	because of
008204	
008205	his oath
008206	
008207	
008208	and the dinner guests
008209	he commanded
008210	it to be given.
008211	
008212	So he sent
008213	beheaded
008214	
008215	and had John
008216	in
008217	
008218	the prison.
008219	
008220	was brought
008221	
008222	His head
008223	
008224	on
008225	a platter
008226	
008227	and given
008228	
008229	to the girl,
008230	
008231	and she brought it
008232	
008233	to her mother.
008234	
008235	
008236	came
008237	
008238	Then John’s disciples
008239	
008240	and took
008241	
008242	the body
008243	
008244	and buried
008245	
008246	
008247	it and went
008248	and told
008249	
008250	Jesus.
008251	heard
008252	Now
008253	
008254	when Jesus
008255	this he went away
008256	from there
008257	in
008258	a boat
008259	to
008260	an isolated
008261	place.
008262	
008263	privately
008264	
008265	heard
008266	
008267	But when the crowd
008268	about it, they followed him
008269	
008270	on foot
008271	from
008272	
008273	the towns.
008274	
008275	As he got out
008276	he saw
008277	the large
008278	crowd,
008279	
008280	and he had compassion
008281	on them
008282	
008283	
008284	and healed
008285	
008286	their sick.
008287	
008288	When evening
008289	
008290	arrived,
008291	came to him
008292	
008293	
008294	his disciples
008295	saying,
008296	an isolated
008297	“This is
008298	
008299	place
008300	
008301	
008302	and the hour
008303	is already
008304	late.
008305	Send
008306	
008307	the crowds away
008308	so that
008309	they can go
008310	into
008311	
008312	the villages
008313	and buy
008314	for themselves.”
008315	food
008316	
008317	But
008318	
008319	he replied,
008320	
008321	
008322	need
008323	“They don’t
008324	to go.
008325	You give them
008326	
008327	
008328	something to eat.”
008329	
008330	
008331	They said to him,
008332	
008333	
008334	“We have
008335	here
008336	
008337	only
008338	five
008339	loaves
008340	
008341	and two
008342	fish.”
008343	
008344	
008345	he replied.
008346	“Bring them
008347	
008348	here to me,”
008349	
008350	
008351	Then he instructed
008352	
008353	the crowds
008354	to sit down
008355	on
008356	
008357	the grass.
008358	He took
008359	
008360	the five
008361	loaves
008362	
008363	
008364	and two
008365	fish,
008366	and looking up
008367	to
008368	
008369	heaven
008370	he gave thanks
008371	
008372	and broke
008373	He gave them
008374	
008375	to the disciples,
008376	
008377	the loaves.
008378	
008379	in turn
008380	who
008381	
008382	gave them to the crowds.
008383	
008384	ate
008385	They all
008386	
008387	and were satisfied,
008388	
008389	and they picked up
008390	
008391	left over,
008392	
008393	the broken pieces
008394	twelve
008395	baskets
008396	full.
008397	
008398	
008399	who ate.
008400	there were
008401	men
008402	about
008403	five thousand
008404	Not counting
008405	women
008406	
008407	and children,
008408	
008409	Immediately
008410	Jesus made
008411	
008412	the disciples
008413	get
008414	into
008415	
008416	the boat
008417	
008418	and go ahead of him
008419	
008420	to
008421	
008422	the other side,
008423	while
008424	
008425	he dispersed
008426	
008427	the crowds.
008428	
008429	And after he sent
008430	
008431	the crowds away,
008432	he went up
008433	
008434	
008435	the mountain
008436	by
008437	himself
008438	to pray.
008439	When evening
008440	
008441	came,
008442	alone.
008443	he was
008444	there
008445	
008446	Meanwhile
008447	the boat,
008448	already
008449	
008450	far
008451	from
008452	
008453	land,
008454	was taking
008455	a beating
008456	from
008457	
008458	the waves
008459	was
008460	because
008461	against it.
008462	
008463	the wind
008464	was ending,
008465	
008466	
008467	
008468	As the night
008469	Jesus came
008470	to them
008471	
008472	walking
008473	on
008474	
008475	the sea.
008476	
008477	
008478	When the disciples
008479	saw him
008480	
008481	on
008482	
008483	the water
008484	walking
008485	they were terrified
008486	and said,
008487	
008488	a ghost!”
008489	“It’s
008490	
008491	with
008492	
008493	fear.
008494	and cried out
008495	immediately
008496	But
008497	spoke to them:
008498	
008499	Jesus
008500	
008501	
008502	“Have courage!
008503	
008504	It is
008505	I. Do not
008506	be afraid.”
008507	
008508	
008509	
008510	
008511	Peter
008512	said to him,
008513	“Lord,
008514	if
008515	
008516	it is you,
008517	order me
008518	
008519	to come
008520	to you
008521	
008522	on
008523	
008524	the water.”
008525	
008526	So
008527	he said,
008528	“Come.”
008529	
008530	got
008531	out of
008532	
008533	the boat,
008534	
008535	Peter
008536	walked
008537	on
008538	
008539	the water,
008540	
008541	and came
008542	toward
008543	
008544	Jesus.
008545	when he saw
008546	But
008547	
008548	wind
008549	the strong
008550	he became afraid.
008551	
008552	And starting
008553	to sink,
008554	he cried out,
008555	
008556	“Lord,
008557	save me!”
008558	
008559	Immediately
008560	
008561	
008562	Jesus
008563	reached out
008564	
008565	his hand
008566	and caught him,
008567	
008568	
008569	saying to him,
008570	
008571	“You of little faith,
008572	
008573	why
008574	did you doubt?”
008575	
008576	When they went up
008577	
008578	into
008579	
008580	the boat,
008581	ceased.
008582	
008583	the wind
008584	
008585	Then
008586	those who were in
008587	
008588	the boat
008589	worshiped him,
008590	
008591	saying,
008592	“Truly
008593	of God.”
008594	the Son
008595	you are
008596	
008597	After they had crossed over,
008598	they came
008599	to
008600	
008601	land
008602	at
008603	Gennesaret.
008604	
008605	recognized him,
008606	
008607	
008608	When the people
008609	
008610	there
008611	
008612	they sent
008613	word into
008614	all
008615	
008616	the surrounding area,
008617	
008618	
008619	and they brought
008620	
008621	all
008622	
008623	their sick to him.
008624	
008625	
008626	They begged him
008627	
008628	if
008629	they could only
008630	touch
008631	
008632	the edge
008633	
008634	of his cloak,
008635	
008636	
008637	and all
008638	who touched
008639	it were healed.
008640	Then
008641	came
008642	
008643	to Jesus
008644	from
008645	Jerusalem
008646	Pharisees
008647	
008648	and experts in the law
008649	and said,
008650	
008651	“Why
008652	
008653	do your disciples
008654	
008655	disobey
008656	
008657	the tradition
008658	
008659	of the elders?
008660	they don’t
008661	For
008662	wash
008663	
008664	their hands
008665	
008666	when
008667	
008668	they eat.”
008669	
008670	
008671	He answered them,
008672	
008673	
008674	because of
008675	“And why
008676	
008677	
008678	do you disobey
008679	
008680	the commandment
008681	
008682	of God
008683	
008684	
008685	your tradition?
008686	
008687	
008688	For
008689	God
008690	said,
008691	‘Honor
008692	
008693	your father
008694	
008695	
008696	and mother’
008697	
008698	
008699	and ‘Whoever insults
008700	his father
008701	or
008702	mother
008703	to death.’
008704	must be put
008705	
008706	But
008707	you say,
008708	‘If someone
008709	
008710	tells
008711	
008712	his father
008713	or
008714	
008715	mother,
008716	is given to God,”
008717	
008718	“Whatever
008719	from me
008720	
008721	help you would have received
008722	
008723	he does not
008724	need to honor
008725	
008726	his father.’
008727	
008728	
008729	You have nullified
008730	
008731	the word
008732	
008733	of God
008734	on account of
008735	
008736	your tradition.
008737	
008738	Hypocrites!
008739	correctly
008740	prophesied
008741	about
008742	
008743	Isaiah
008744	you when he said,
008745	
008746	‘This people
008747	
008748	
008749	with their lips,
008750	
008751	honors me
008752	
008753	but
008754	their heart
008755	
008756	far
008757	is
008758	from me,
008759	
008760	in vain,
008761	
008762	and they worship me
008763	
008764	teaching
008765	as doctrines
008766	the commandments
008767	of men.’”
008768	
008769	Then he called
008770	
008771	the crowd
008772	to him and said,
008773	
008774	“Listen
008775	
008776	and understand.
008777	is not
008778	
008779	what goes
008780	into
008781	
008782	the mouth;
008783	What defiles
008784	
008785	a person
008786	
008787	
008788	it is what comes out
008789	of
008790	
008791	the mouth
008792	
008793	that defiles
008794	
008795	a person.”
008796	Then
008797	came to him
008798	
008799	the disciples
008800	and said,
008801	
008802	“Do you know
008803	
008804	
008805	that when the Pharisees
008806	heard
008807	
008808	this saying
008809	they were offended?”
008810	
008811	And
008812	he replied,
008813	
008814	“Every
008815	plant
008816	that
008817	did not
008818	plant

008820	Father
008821	
008822	
008823	my heavenly
008824	will be uprooted.
008825	Leave them!

008827	blind
008828	They are
008829	guides.
008830	someone who is blind
008831	another who is blind,
008832	
008833	
008834	If
008835	leads
008836	both
008837	into
008838	a pit.”
008839	will fall
008840	
008841	But
008842	
008843	Peter
008844	said to him,
008845	
008846	“Explain
008847	
008848	
008849	this parable to us.”
008850	
008851	
008852	
008853	Jesus said,
008854	“Even after all this,
008855	
008856	
008857	still so foolish?
008858	are you
008859	Don’t
008860	you understand
008861	
008862	that whatever
008863	
008864	goes
008865	into
008866	
008867	the mouth
008868	into
008869	
008870	the stomach
008871	enters
008872	
008873	
008874	the sewer?
008875	and then passes out
008876	
008877	But
008878	the things that come out
008879	of
008880	
008881	the mouth
008882	from
008883	
008884	the heart,
008885	come
008886	and these things
008887	defile
008888	
008889	a person.
008890	out of
008891	For
008892	
008893	the heart
008894	come
008895	ideas,
008896	evil
008897	murder,
008898	adultery,
008899	sexual immorality,
008900	theft,
008901	false testimony,
008902	slander.
008903	
008904	These are
008905	
008906	the things that defile
008907	
008908	a person;
008909	
008910	
008911	with unwashed
008912	hands
008913	eating
008914	it is not
008915	that defiles
008916	
008917	a person.”
008918	
008919	After going out
008920	from there,
008921	
008922	Jesus
008923	went
008924	to
008925	
008926	the region
008927	of Tyre
008928	
008929	and Sidon.
008930	
008931	
008932	woman
008933	A Canaanite
008934	from
008935	
008936	area
008937	that
008938	came
008939	and cried out,
008940	
008941	“Have mercy on me,
008942	
008943	Lord,
008944	Son
008945	of David!
008946	
008947	My daughter
008948	
008949	is horribly
008950	demon-possessed!”
008951	
008952	But
008953	he did not
008954	answer her
008955	
008956	a word.
008957	
008958	came
008959	
008960	Then his disciples
008961	
008962	and begged him,
008963	
008964	
008965	“Send
008966	her away,
008967	
008968	because she keeps on crying out
008969	after us.”
008970	
008971	
008972	So
008973	he answered,
008974	
008975	
008976	“I was sent
008977	
008978	only
008979	to
008980	
008981	sheep
008982	
008983	the lost
008984	of the house
008985	of Israel.”
008986	
008987	But
008988	she came
008989	and bowed down before him
008990	
008991	and said,
008992	“Lord,
008993	help me!”
008994	
008995	
008996	
008997	
008998	he said.
008999	not
009000	“It is
009001	right
009002	to take
009003	
009004	bread
009005	
009006	the children’s
009007	
009008	and throw
009009	
009010	it to the dogs,”
009011	
009012	
009013	she replied,
009014	“Yes,
009015	Lord,”
009016	
009017	“but
009018	
009019	even the dogs
009020	eat
009021	from
009022	
009023	the crumbs
009024	
009025	that fall
009026	
009027	
009028	table.”
009029	
009030	their masters’
009031	
009032	Then
009033	answered her,
009034	
009035	Jesus
009036	
009037	
009038	
009039	“Woman,
009040	is great!
009041	
009042	
009043	your faith
009044	be done for you.”
009045	
009046	
009047	Let what you want
009048	
009049	was healed
009050	
009051	And her daughter
009052	
009053	from
009054	
009055	hour.
009056	that
009057	
009058	When he left
009059	there,
009060	
009061	Jesus
009062	went
009063	along
009064	
009065	the Sea
009066	
009067	of Galilee.
009068	
009069	Then he went up
009070	
009071	
009072	a mountain,
009073	he sat down.
009074	where
009075	
009076	came to him
009077	
009078	crowds
009079	Then large
009080	bringing
009081	with
009082	them
009083	the lame,
009084	blind,
009085	crippled,
009086	mute,
009087	
009088	others.
009089	and many
009090	
009091	They laid them
009092	
009093	at
009094	
009095	his feet,
009096	
009097	
009098	and he healed them.
009099	
009100	As a result,
009101	
009102	the crowd
009103	was amazed
009104	when they saw
009105	the mute
009106	speaking,
009107	the crippled
009108	healthy,
009109	
009110	the lame
009111	walking,
009112	
009113	and the blind
009114	seeing,
009115	
009116	and they praised
009117	
009118	the God
009119	of Israel.
009120	
009121	Then
009122	Jesus
009123	called
009124	
009125	the disciples
009126	
009127	and said,
009128	“I have compassion
009129	on
009130	
009131	the crowd,
009132	because they have
009133	already
009134	days
009135	three
009136	been here with me
009137	
009138	
009139	nothing
009140	and they have
009141	
009142	to eat.
009143	
009144	to send them
009145	
009146	away hungry
009147	
009148	I don’t want
009149	since
009150	they may faint
009151	on
009152	
009153	the way.”
009154	
009155	said to him,
009156	
009157	
009158	The disciples
009159	“Where
009160	
009161	in
009162	this desolate place
009163	bread
009164	can we get enough
009165	
009166	to satisfy
009167	a crowd?”
009168	so great
009169	
009170	said to them,
009171	
009172	
009173	Jesus
009174	“How many
009175	loaves
009176	do you have?”
009177	
009178	
009179	They replied,
009180	“Seven –
009181	
009182	and a few
009183	small fish.”
009184	
009185	After instructing
009186	
009187	the crowd
009188	to sit down
009189	on
009190	
009191	the ground,
009192	he took
009193	
009194	the seven
009195	loaves
009196	
009197	
009198	and the fish,
009199	
009200	and after giving thanks,
009201	he broke
009202	
009203	them and began giving
009204	
009205	them to the disciples,
009206	
009207	then
009208	who
009209	
009210	gave them to the crowds.
009211	
009212	ate
009213	They all
009214	
009215	and were satisfied,
009216	
009217	
009218	left over,
009219	
009220	the broken pieces
009221	and they picked up
009222	seven
009223	baskets
009224	full.
009225	
009226	
009227	who ate.
009228	there were
009229	four thousand
009230	men
009231	Not counting
009232	and women,
009233	
009234	children
009235	
009236	After sending away
009237	
009238	the crowd,
009239	he got
009240	into
009241	
009242	the boat
009243	
009244	and went
009245	to
009246	
009247	the region
009248	of Magadan.
009249	
009250	came
009251	
009252	Now when the Pharisees
009253	
009254	and Sadducees
009255	to test
009256	Jesus, they asked him
009257	
009258	a sign
009259	from
009260	
009261	heaven.
009262	to show them
009263	
009264	
009265	
009266	
009267	He said,
009268	
009269	“When evening
009270	comes
009271	‘It will be fair weather,
009272	you say,
009273	is red,’
009274	because
009275	
009276	the sky
009277	
009278	and in the morning,
009279	today,
009280	‘It will be stormy
009281	is red
009282	because
009283	and darkening.’
009284	
009285	the sky
009286	
009287	
009288	the appearance
009289	
009290	of the sky,
009291	You know
009292	how to judge correctly
009293	
009294	but
009295	evaluate the signs
009296	
009297	of the times.
009298	
009299	you cannot
009300	generation
009301	A wicked
009302	
009303	and adulterous
009304	a sign,
009305	asks for
009306	
009307	sign
009308	but no
009309	will be given to it
009310	
009311	
009312	except
009313	
009314	the sign
009315	of Jonah.”
009316	
009317	Then he left them
009318	
009319	and went away.
009320	
009321	went
009322	
009323	When the disciples
009324	to
009325	
009326	the other side,
009327	they forgot
009328	bread.
009329	to take
009330	
009331	
009332	Jesus
009333	said to them,
009334	
009335	“Watch out,”
009336	
009337	“beware
009338	of
009339	
009340	the yeast
009341	
009342	of the Pharisees
009343	
009344	and Sadducees.”
009345	
009346	So
009347	they began to discuss
009348	this among
009349	themselves,
009350	saying,
009351	
009352	bread.”
009353	no
009354	“It is because we brought
009355	learned
009356	
009357	
009358	When Jesus
009359	of this, he said,
009360	Why
009361	are you arguing
009362	among
009363	yourselves
009364	“You who have such little faith!
009365	
009366	bread?
009367	no
009368	about having
009369	Do you still not
009370	understand?
009371	Don’t
009372	you remember
009373	
009374	the five
009375	loaves
009376	
009377	for the five thousand,
009378	
009379	and how many
009380	baskets
009381	you took up?
009382	Or
009383	
009384	the seven
009385	loaves
009386	
009387	for the four thousand
009388	
009389	and how many
009390	baskets
009391	you took up?
009392	How
009393	could you not
009394	understand
009395	
009396	that I was not
009397	about
009398	bread?
009399	speaking to you
009400	
009401	beware
009402	But
009403	of
009404	
009405	the yeast
009406	
009407	of the Pharisees
009408	
009409	and Sadducees!”
009410	Then
009411	they understood
009412	
009413	that he had not
009414	told
009415	them to be on guard
009416	against
009417	
009418	the yeast
009419	
009420	in bread,
009421	but
009422	against
009423	
009424	the teaching
009425	
009426	of the Pharisees
009427	
009428	and Sadducees.
009429	came
009430	
009431	
009432	When Jesus
009433	to
009434	
009435	the area
009436	of Caesarea
009437	
009438	Philippi,
009439	he asked
009440	
009441	his disciples,
009442	
009443	say
009444	“Who
009445	
009446	
009447	do people
009448	is?”
009449	
009450	that the Son
009451	
009452	of Man
009453	
009454	
009455	They answered,
009456	
009457	
009458	“Some say John
009459	
009460	the Baptist,
009461	others
009462	and
009463	Elijah,
009464	others
009465	
009466	Jeremiah
009467	or
009468	one
009469	
009470	of the prophets.”
009471	He said to them,
009472	
009473	
009474	“But
009475	who
009476	
009477	do you say
009478	that I am?”
009479	answered,
009480	
009481	Simon
009482	Peter
009483	
009484	
009485	“You are
009486	
009487	the Christ,
009488	
009489	the Son
009490	
009491	God.”
009492	
009493	of the living
009494	answered him,
009495	And
009496	
009497	Jesus
009498	
009499	
009500	blessed,
009501	“You are
009502	Simon
009503	son of Jonah,
009504	
009505	because flesh
009506	
009507	and blood
009508	did not
009509	reveal this to you,
009510	
009511	but
009512	
009513	my Father
009514	
009515	
009516	in
009517	
009518	heaven!
009519	And I
009520	
009521	
009522	tell
009523	
009524	
009525	you that you are
009526	Peter,
009527	
009528	and on
009529	
009530	
009531	this rock
009532	I will build
009533	
009534	
009535	my church,
009536	
009537	and the gates
009538	of Hades
009539	will not
009540	overpower it.
009541	
009542	I will give you
009543	
009544	
009545	the keys
009546	
009547	of the kingdom
009548	
009549	of heaven.
009550	
009551	
009552	Whatever
009553	you bind
009554	on
009555	
009556	earth
009557	will have been
009558	bound
009559	in
009560	
009561	heaven,
009562	
009563	
009564	and whatever
009565	you release
009566	on
009567	
009568	earth
009569	will have been
009570	released
009571	in
009572	
009573	heaven.”
009574	Then
009575	he instructed
009576	
009577	his disciples
009578	not to
009579	anyone
009580	tell
009581	
009582	
009583	that he was
009584	
009585	the Christ.
009586	From
009587	that time on
009588	began
009589	
009590	Jesus
009591	to show
009592	
009593	his disciples
009594	
009595	
009596	that he must
009597	
009598	to
009599	Jerusalem
009600	go
009601	
009602	many things
009603	and suffer
009604	at the hands of
009605	
009606	the elders,
009607	
009608	chief priests,
009609	
009610	and experts in the law,
009611	
009612	and be killed,
009613	
009614	
009615	and on the third
009616	day
009617	be raised.
009618	
009619	took
009620	him aside
009621	
009622	So Peter
009623	and began
009624	to rebuke him:
009625	
009626	
009627	“God forbid,
009628	
009629	Lord!
009630	
009631	This must not
009632	happen to you!”
009633	
009634	
009635	
009636	But
009637	he turned
009638	and said
009639	
009640	to Peter,
009641	“Get
009642	behind me,
009643	
009644	Satan!
009645	a stumbling block to me,
009646	You are
009647	
009648	
009649	because you are not
009650	setting your mind
009651	
009652	
009653	on God’s
009654	interests, but
009655	
009656	
009657	on man’s.”
009658	Then
009659	
009660	Jesus
009661	said
009662	
009663	to his disciples,
009664	
009665	“If
009666	anyone
009667	wants
009668	my follower,
009669	
009670	to become
009671	he must deny
009672	himself,
009673	
009674	take up
009675	
009676	his cross,
009677	
009678	
009679	and follow me.
009680	
009681	whoever
009682	For
009683	
009684	wants
009685	
009686	his life
009687	
009688	to save
009689	will lose it,
009690	
009691	whoever
009692	but
009693	
009694	loses
009695	
009696	his life
009697	
009698	because of me
009699	
009700	will find it.
009701	
009702	what
009703	For
009704	does it benefit
009705	a person
009706	if
009707	
009708	world
009709	the whole
009710	he gains
009711	
009712	but
009713	his life?
009714	
009715	forfeits
009716	Or
009717	what
009718	give
009719	can a person
009720	in exchange
009721	
009722	for his life?
009723	
009724	will

009726	
009727	the Son
009728	
009729	of Man
009730	come
009731	in
009732	
009733	the glory
009734	
009735	of his Father,
009736	
009737	with
009738	
009739	his angels
009740	
009741	
009742	and then
009743	he will reward
009744	each person
009745	according to
009746	what
009747	he has done.
009748	
009749	the truth,
009750	I tell you
009751	
009752	
009753	there are
009754	some
009755	
009756	here
009757	standing
009758	who
009759	
009760	will not
009761	experience
009762	death
009763	before
009764	
009765	they see
009766	
009767	the Son
009768	
009769	of Man
009770	coming
009771	in
009772	
009773	his kingdom.”
009774	
009775	
009776	later
009777	days
009778	Six
009779	took with
009780	
009781	Jesus
009782	
009783	him Peter,
009784	
009785	James,
009786	
009787	and John
009788	
009789	the brother
009790	
009791	
009792	of James, and led them
009793	
009794	up
009795	mountain.
009796	a high
009797	
009798	privately
009799	
009800	And he was transfigured
009801	before them.
009802	
009803	
009804	shone
009805	
009806	His face
009807	
009808	like
009809	
009810	the sun,
009811	
009812	and
009813	his clothes
009814	
009815	became
009816	white
009817	as
009818	
009819	light.
009820	
009821	
009822	also appeared before them,
009823	
009824	Then Moses
009825	
009826	and Elijah
009827	talking
009828	with him.
009829	
009830	
009831	So
009832	
009833	Peter
009834	said
009835	
009836	to Jesus,
009837	“Lord,
009838	good for us
009839	it is
009840	
009841	here.
009842	to be
009843	If
009844	you want,
009845	I will make
009846	
009847	three
009848	shelters –
009849	
009850	one for you,
009851	
009852	for Moses,
009853	one
009854	
009855	for Elijah.”
009856	and one
009857	While he was still
009858	
009859	speaking,
009860	
009861	cloud
009862	a bright
009863	overshadowed them,
009864	
009865	
009866	
009867	and a voice
009868	from
009869	
009870	the cloud
009871	said,
009872	
009873	“This is
009874	
009875	Son,
009876	
009877	
009878	my one dear
009879	in
009880	whom
009881	I take great delight.
009882	Listen to him!”
009883	
009884	
009885	heard
009886	
009887	When the disciples
009888	and threw
009889	themselves down with
009890	their faces to the ground.
009891	
009892	
009893	with fear
009894	this, they were overwhelmed
009895	
009896	came
009897	
009898	But Jesus
009899	
009900	and touched them.
009901	
009902	he said.
009903	“Get up,”
009904	
009905	“Do not
009906	be afraid.”
009907	When they looked up,
009908	
009909	
009910	
009911	
009912	
009913	all they saw
009914	
009915	
009916	
009917	was Jesus
009918	alone.
009919	
009920	As they were coming down
009921	
009922	from
009923	
009924	the mountain,
009925	commanded them,
009926	
009927	
009928	Jesus
009929	
009930	“Do not
009931	tell anyone
009932	
009933	about the vision
009934	until
009935	
009936	
009937	the Son
009938	
009939	of Man
009940	from
009941	the dead.”
009942	is raised
009943	
009944	asked him,
009945	
009946	
009947	The disciples
009948	
009949	“Why
009950	then
009951	
009952	do the experts in the law
009953	say
009954	
009955	that Elijah
009956	must
009957	come
009958	first?”
009959	
009960	
009961	He answered,
009962	
009963	“Elijah
009964	does indeed
009965	come
009966	
009967	first and will restore
009968	all things.
009969	I tell you
009970	And
009971	
009972	
009973	that Elijah
009974	has already
009975	come.
009976	
009977	Yet they did not
009978	recognize him,
009979	
009980	but
009981	did
009982	to him
009983	
009984	whatever
009985	they wanted.
009986	In the same way,
009987	
009988	
009989	the Son
009990	
009991	of Man
009992	will
009993	suffer
009994	at their hands.”
009995	
009996	Then
009997	understood
009998	
009999	the disciples
010000	
010001	about
010002	John
010003	
010004	the Baptist.
010005	that he was speaking to them
010006	
010007	
010008	When they came
010009	to
010010	
010011	the crowd,
010012	came to him,
010013	
010014	a man
010015	knelt before him,
010016	
010017	
010018	and said,
010019	“Lord,
010020	have mercy
010021	
010022	
010023	on my son,
010024	
010025	because he has seizures
010026	
010027	terribly,
010028	and suffers
010029	he often
010030	for
010031	falls
010032	into
010033	
010034	the fire
010035	
010036	
010037	and into
010038	
010039	the water.
010040	
010041	I brought him
010042	
010043	
010044	to your disciples,
010045	
010046	
010047	but they were not
010048	able
010049	
010050	to heal him.”
010051	answered,
010052	
010053	
010054	Jesus
010055	
010056	“You
010057	generation!
010058	unbelieving
010059	
010060	and perverse
010061	How much
010062	longer
010063	with you?
010064	
010065	must I be
010066	How much
010067	longer
010068	must I endure
010069	
010070	you? Bring him
010071	
010072	
010073	here to me.”
010074	
010075	rebuked
010076	
010077	
010078	Then Jesus
010079	
010080	came out
010081	of him,
010082	
010083	
010084	the demon and it
010085	
010086	was healed
010087	
010088	and the boy
010089	from
010090	
010091	moment.
010092	that
010093	Then
010094	came
010095	
010096	the disciples
010097	
010098	to Jesus
010099	
010100	privately
010101	and said,
010102	
010103	“Why
010104	
010105	
010106	couldn’t
010107	we cast
010108	it out?”
010109	
010110	
010111	He told them,
010112	
010113	“It was because of
010114	
010115	your little faith.
010116	
010117	the truth,
010118	
010119	I tell you
010120	
010121	if
010122	you have
010123	faith
010124	the size of
010125	seed,
010126	a mustard
010127	you will say
010128	
010129	to this mountain,
010130	
010131	‘Move
010132	from here
010133	to there,’
010134	
010135	and it will move;
010136	
010137	nothing
010138	will be impossible for you.”
010139	
010140	When they gathered together
010141	
010142	
010143	in
010144	
010145	Galilee,
010146	told them,
010147	
010148	
010149	Jesus
010150	is going
010151	
010152	“The Son
010153	
010154	of Man
010155	to be betrayed
010156	into
010157	the hands
010158	of men.
010159	
010160	They will kill him,
010161	
010162	
010163	
010164	and on the third
010165	day
010166	he will be raised.”
010167	
010168	distressed.
010169	And they became greatly
010170	After they arrived
010171	
010172	
010173	in
010174	Capernaum,
010175	came to
010176	
010177	
010178	of the temple tax
010179	the collectors
010180	
010181	Peter
010182	
010183	and said,
010184	
010185	“Your teacher
010186	
010187	doesn’t he?”
010188	pays
010189	
010190	the double drachma tax,
010191	He said,
010192	“Yes.”
010193	
010194	When Peter came
010195	into
010196	
010197	the house,
010198	first,
010199	
010200	
010201	Jesus
010202	spoke to him
010203	“What
010204	
010205	do you think,
010206	Simon?
010207	
010208	kings

010216	taxes –
010217	from
010218	
010219	their sons
010220	
010221	or
010222	from
010223	
010224	foreigners?”
010225	After he said,
010226	
010227	“From
010228	
010229	foreigners,”
010230	said to him,
010231	
010232	
010233	Jesus
010234	“Then
010235	
010236	free.
010237	are
010238	
010239	the sons
010240	so that
010241	But
010242	we don’t
010243	offend them,
010244	
010245	go
010246	to
010247	the lake
010248	and throw out
010249	a hook.
010250	
010251	
010252	that comes up,
010253	the first
010254	fish
010255	Take
010256	
010257	and when you open
010258	
010259	its mouth,
010260	
010261	you will find
010262	a four drachma coin.
010263	that
010264	Take
010265	and give it to them
010266	
010267	for me and you.”
010268	
010269	
010270	
010271	At
010272	that
010273	
010274	time
010275	came
010276	
010277	the disciples
010278	
010279	to Jesus
010280	saying,
010281	“Who

010283	the greatest
010284	is
010285	in

010289	of heaven?”
010290	
010291	He called
010292	a child, had him
010293	stand
010294	
010295	among them,

010297	
010298	
010299	“I tell you

010691	
010692	among them.”
010693	
010694	Then
010695	came to him
010696	
010697	Peter
010698	and said,
010699	
010700	“Lord,
010701	how many times
010702	who sins
010703	against me?
010704	
010705	
010706	my brother
010707	
010708	
010709	must I forgive
010710	
010711	As many as
010712	seven times?”
010713	said to him,
010714	
010715	
010716	Jesus
010717	“Not
010718	I tell you,
010719	
010720	
010721	seven times,
010722	but
010723	
010724	
010725	seventy-seven times!
010726	“For
010727	
010728	is like
010729	
010730	this reason, the kingdom
010731	
010732	of heaven
010733	
010734	a king
010735	who
010736	wanted
010737	to settle
010738	accounts
010739	with
010740	
010741	his slaves.
010742	
010743	began
010744	As
010745	he
010746	settling his accounts,
010747	was brought to him.
010748	
010749	a man
010750	who owed
010751	ten thousand
010752	talents
010753	Because he was not
010754	able
010755	
010756	
010757	to repay
010758	ordered him
010759	
010760	
010761	it, the lord
010762	to be sold,
010763	along with
010764	
010765	his wife,
010766	
010767	
010768	children,
010769	
010770	
010771	and whatever
010772	he possessed,
010773	
010774	and repayment to be made.
010775	threw
010776	Then
010777	
010778	the slave
010779	himself to the ground before him,
010780	
010781	saying,
010782	‘Be patient
010783	with me,
010784	
010785	
010786	everything.’
010787	and I will repay you
010788	
010789	had compassion
010790	
010791	
010792	The lord
010793	
010794	slave
010795	on that
010796	and released him,
010797	
010798	
010799	
010800	the debt.
010801	and forgave him
010802	
010803	After he went out,
010804	
010805	
010806	same slave
010807	that
010808	found
010809	one
010810	
010811	of his fellow slaves
010812	
010813	who
010814	owed him
010815	
010816	one hundred
010817	silver coins.
010818	
010819	So he grabbed him
010820	
010821	by the throat and started to choke him,
010822	saying,
010823	‘Pay back
010824	
010825	what
010826	you owe me!’
010827	threw
010828	Then
010829	
010830	his fellow slave
010831	himself down
010832	and begged him,
010833	
010834	
010835	‘Be patient
010836	with me,
010837	
010838	
010839	and I will repay you.’
010840	
010841	
010842	But
010843	
010844	he refused.
010845	Instead,
010846	he went out
010847	and threw him
010848	
010849	in
010850	prison
010851	until
010852	he repaid
010853	
010854	the debt.
010855	saw
010856	
010857	
010858	When his fellow slaves
010859	
010860	
010861	what had happened,
010862	upset
010863	they were very
010864	
010865	and went
010866	and told
010867	
010868	lord
010869	their
010870	everything
010871	
010872	that had taken place.
010873	Then
010874	called
010875	
010876	
010877	his lord
010878	
010879	the first slave and said to him,
010880	
010881	slave!
010882	‘Evil
010883	all
010884	
010885	debt
010886	that
010887	I forgave you
010888	
010889	because
010890	you begged me!
010891	
010892	not
010893	Should you
010894	
010895	
010896	have shown mercy
010897	
010898	to your fellow slave,
010899	
010900	just as
010901	I
010902	
010903	showed it to you?’
010904	
010905	And in anger
010906	
010907	his lord
010908	
010909	turned
010910	him over
010911	
010912	to the prison guards to torture
010913	him until
010914	
010915	he repaid
010916	all
010917	
010918	he owed.
010919	So
010920	
010921	
010922	Father
010923	
010924	
010925	also my heavenly
010926	will do to you,
010927	
010928	if
010929	not
010930	forgive
010931	each of you does
010932	
010933	your brother
010934	
010935	from
010936	
010937	your heart.”
010938	
010939	
010940	
010941	Now when
010942	finished
010943	
010944	Jesus
010945	
010946	these sayings,
010947	
010948	he left
010949	
010950	
010951	Galilee
010952	
010953	and went
010954	to
010955	
010956	the region
010957	
010958	of Judea
010959	beyond
010960	
010961	the Jordan River.
010962	
010963	followed him,
010964	
010965	crowds
010966	Large
010967	
010968	and he healed them
010969	
010970	there.
010971	
010972	came to him
010973	
010974	Then some Pharisees
010975	in order to test him.
010976	
010977	
010978	They asked,
010979	
010980	“Is it lawful
010981	
010982	to divorce
010983	
010984	a wife
010985	
010986	for
010987	any
010988	cause?”
010989	
010990	
010991	He answered,
010992	
010993	“Have you not
010994	read
010995	
010996	
010997	the Creator
010998	that from
010999	the beginning
011000	male
011001	
011002	and female,
011003	made them
011004	
011005	
011006	and said,
011007	‘For
011008	
011009	will leave
011010	this reason a man
011011	
011012	his father
011013	
011014	
011015	and mother
011016	
011017	and will be united
011018	
011019	with his wife,
011020	
011021	
011022	will become
011023	
011024	and the two
011025	
011026	flesh’?
011027	one
011028	So
011029	no longer
011030	they are
011031	two,
011032	but
011033	flesh.
011034	one
011035	what
011036	Therefore
011037	
011038	God
011039	has joined together,
011040	one
011041	let no
011042	separate.”
011043	They said to him,
011044	
011045	“Why
011046	then
011047	did Moses
011048	command
011049	us to give
011050	a certificate
011051	of dismissal
011052	
011053	and to divorce her?”
011054	
011055	Jesus said to them,
011056	
011057	
011058	“Moses
011059	because of
011060	
011061	your hard hearts,
011062	
011063	permitted
011064	
011065	you to divorce
011066	
011067	your wives
011068	
011069	from
011070	the beginning
011071	but
011072	not
011073	it was
011074	this way.
011075	I say to you
011076	Now
011077	
011078	
011079	that whoever
011080	
011081	divorces
011082	
011083	his wife,
011084	
011085	except
011086	for
011087	immorality,
011088	
011089	and marries
011090	another
011091	commits adultery.”
011092	said to him,
011093	
011094	
011095	The disciples
011096	
011097	“If
011098	this
011099	is
011100	
011101	the case
011102	
011103	of a husband
011104	with
011105	
011106	a wife,
011107	not
011108	it is better
011109	to marry!”
011110	
011111	
011112	He said to them,
011113	
011114	“Not
011115	everyone
011116	can accept
011117	
011118	this statement,
011119	
011120	except
011121	those to whom
011122	it has been given.
011123	there are
011124	For
011125	some eunuchs
011126	who
011127	from
011128	
011129	birth,
011130	were
011131	that way
011132	
011133	were
011134	and some
011135	who
011136	made eunuchs
011137	by
011138	
011139	others,
011140	
011141	
011142	and some
011143	who
011144	became eunuchs
011145	
011146	for the sake
011147	
011148	of the kingdom
011149	
011150	of heaven.
011151	The one who
011152	is able
011153	to accept
011154	this should accept it.”
011155	Then
011156	were brought to him
011157	
011158	little children
011159	for him
011160	
011161	his hands on them
011162	to lay
011163	
011164	
011165	and pray.
011166	
011167	But
011168	the disciples
011169	scolded those who brought them.
011170	
011171	
011172	But
011173	Jesus
011174	said,
011175	
011176	
011177	“Let the little children
011178	
011179	and do not
011180	try to stop them,
011181	
011182	come
011183	to me
011184	
011185	
011186	for
011187	such as these.”
011188	belongs to
011189	
011190	the kingdom
011191	
011192	of heaven
011193	
011194	And he placed
011195	
011196	his hands on them
011197	
011198	and went on
011199	his way.
011200	
011201	
011202	Now someone
011203	came up to him
011204	
011205	and said,
011206	“Teacher,
011207	what
011208	good thing
011209	must I do
011210	to
011211	gain
011212	life?”
011213	eternal
011214	
011215	
011216	He said to him,
011217	
011218	“Why
011219	
011220	do you ask me
011221	about
011222	
011223	what is good?
011224	only one
011225	There is
011226	
011227	who is good.
011228	if
011229	But
011230	you want
011231	into
011232	
011233	life,
011234	to enter
011235	keep
011236	
011237	the commandments.”
011238	he asked.
011239	
011240	“Which ones?”
011241	
011242	
011243	Jesus
011244	replied,
011245	
011246	“Do not
011247	murder,
011248	do not
011249	commit adultery,
011250	do not
011251	steal,
011252	do not
011253	give false testimony,
011254	honor
011255	
011256	your father
011257	
011258	
011259	and mother,
011260	
011261	and love
011262	
011263	your neighbor
011264	
011265	as
011266	yourself.”
011267	said to him,
011268	
011269	
011270	The young man
011271	all
011272	
011273	“I have wholeheartedly obeyed
011274	these laws. What
011275	do I still
011276	lack?”
011277	said to him,
011278	
011279	
011280	Jesus
011281	“If
011282	you wish
011283	perfect,
011284	to be
011285	go
011286	sell
011287	
011288	
011289	your possessions
011290	
011291	and give
011292	
011293	the money to the poor,
011294	
011295	and you will have
011296	treasure
011297	in
011298	heaven.
011299	
011300	Then come,
011301	follow me.”
011302	
011303	heard
011304	But
011305	
011306	when the young man
011307	
011308	this
011309	he went away
011310	sorrowful,
011311	he was
011312	for
011313	
011314	rich.
011315	very
011316	
011317	Then
011318	Jesus
011319	“I tell you
011320	
011321	to his disciples,
011322	
011323	the truth,
011324	said
011325	
011326	
011327	for a rich person
011328	it will be hard
011329	to enter
011330	
011331	
011332	the kingdom
011333	
011334	of heaven!
011335	Again
011336	
011337	I say,
011338	
011339	easier
011340	it is
011341	for a camel
011342	
011343	the eye
011344	of a needle
011345	to go through
011346	than
011347	for a rich person
011348	to enter
011349	into
011350	
011351	the kingdom
011352	
011353	of God.”
011354	when they heard
011355	
011356	
011357	The disciples
011358	astonished
011359	were greatly
011360	this and said,
011361	who
011362	“Then
011363	can
011364	be saved?”
011365	looked at them
011366	
011367	
011368	Jesus
011369	and replied,
011370	
011371	for
011372	mere humans,
011373	
011374	impossible
011375	“This is
011376	for
011377	but
011378	God
011379	all things
011380	are possible.”
011381	Then
011382	
011383	
011384	Peter
011385	said to him,
011386	
011387	“Look,
011388	
011389	we have left
011390	everything
011391	
011392	to follow you!
011393	
011394	What
011395	then
011396	will there be for us?”

011474	
011475	the kingdom

011479	a landowner
011480	who
011481	went out
011482	
011483	early in the morning
011484	to hire
011485	workers
011486	for
011487	
011488	his vineyard.
011489	
011490	after agreeing
011491	And
011492	with
011493	
011494	the workers
011495	for
011496	the standard wage,
011497	
011498	
011499	he sent them
011500	
011501	into
011502	
011503	his vineyard.
011504	
011505	
011506	in the morning, he went out
011507	When it was about
011508	nine
011509	o’clock
011510	again and saw
011511	others
011512	standing around
011513	in
011514	
011515	the marketplace
011516	without work.
011517	
011518	to them,
011519	He said
011520	‘You go
011521	
011522	
011523	into
011524	
011525	the vineyard

011527	whatever
011528	
011529	is
011530	right.’
011531	too, and I will give you
011532	
011533	
011534	So
011535	they went.
011536	again
011537	
011538	When he went out
011539	about
011540	noon
011541	
011542	and three
011543	o’clock
011544	that afternoon, he did
011545	the same thing.
011546	about
011547	And
011548	
011549	five o’clock that afternoon
011550	he went out
011551	and found
011552	others
011553	standing around,
011554	
011555	and said to them,
011556	
011557	‘Why
011558	here
011559	are you standing
011560	all
011561	
011562	day
011563	without work?’
011564	They said to him,
011565	
011566	
011567	‘Because no one
011568	
011569	hired us.’
011570	He said to them,
011571	
011572	‘You go
011573	
011574	
011575	and work in
011576	
011577	the vineyard too.’
011578	evening
011579	
011580	When it was
011581	said
011582	
011583	the owner
011584	
011585	of the vineyard
011586	
011587	to his manager,
011588	
011589	‘Call
011590	
011591	the workers
011592	
011593	and give
011594	
011595	
011596	the pay
011597	starting
011598	with
011599	
011600	the last
011601	hired until
011602	
011603	the first.’
011604	
011605	came,
011606	
011607	When those hired about
011608	
011609	five
011610	o’clock
011611	received
011612	each
011613	a full day’s pay.
011614	
011615	came,
011616	
011617	And when those hired first
011618	they thought
011619	
011620	more.
011621	they would receive
011622	
011623	also received
011624	
011625	But each one
011626	the standard wage.
011627	
011628	
011629	When they received
011630	
011631	it, they began to complain
011632	against
011633	
011634	the landowner,
011635	saying,
011636	
011637	
011638	‘These last
011639	one
011640	hour,
011641	fellows worked
011642	
011643	equal to us
011644	
011645	
011646	and you have made them
011647	
011648	who bore
011649	
011650	the hardship
011651	
011652	of the day.’
011653	
011654	
011655	and burning heat
011656	
011657	And
011658	the landowner replied
011659	to one of them,
011660	
011661	
011662	‘Friend,
011663	I am not
011664	treating you
011665	unfairly.
011666	Didn’t
011667	to work for the standard wage?
011668	you agree with me
011669	
011670	Take
011671	
011672	what is yours
011673	
011674	and go.
011675	I want
011676	
011677	
011678	
011679	to this last man
011680	to give
011681	the same as I gave to you.
011682	
011683	
011684	
011685	Am I not
011686	permitted
011687	
011688	what
011689	I want
011690	to do
011691	with
011692	what belongs
011693	to me?
011694	Or
011695	
011696	
011697	
011698	envious
011699	are you
011700	
011701	
011702	generous?’
011703	because I am
011704	So
011705	will be
011706	
011707	the last
011708	first,
011709	
011710	
011711	and the first
011712	last.”
011713	
011714	was going up
011715	
011716	As Jesus
011717	to
011718	Jerusalem,
011719	he took
011720	
011721	the twelve
011722	
011723	aside
011724	privately
011725	
011726	on
011727	
011728	the way,
011729	and said
011730	to them
011731	“Look,
011732	we are going up
011733	to
011734	Jerusalem,
011735	
011736	
011737	and the Son
011738	
011739	of Man
011740	will be handed over
011741	
011742	to the chief priests
011743	
011744	and the experts in the law.
011745	
011746	They will condemn him
011747	
011748	to death,
011749	
011750	and will turn
011751	him over
011752	
011753	to the Gentiles
011754	to
011755	
011756	be mocked
011757	
011758	and flogged severely
011759	
011760	and crucified.
011761	
011762	
011763	Yet on the third
011764	day,
011765	he will be raised.”
011766	Then
011767	came
011768	to him
011769	
011770	the mother
011771	
011772	of the sons
011773	of Zebedee
011774	with
011775	
011776	her sons,
011777	
011778	and kneeling down
011779	
011780	she asked
011781	for a favor.
011782	
011783	him
011784	
011785	
011786	
011787	
011788	“What
011789	do you want?”
011790	He said to her,
011791	
011792	She replied,
011793	“Permit
011794	to sit,
011795	
011796	
011797	these two
011798	sons of mine
011799	
011800	one
011801	at
011802	your right hand
011803	
011804	
011805	and one
011806	at
011807	your left,
011808	
011809	in
011810	
011811	your kingdom.”
011812	
011813	answered,
011814	
011815	
011816	Jesus
011817	
011818	“You don’t
011819	know
011820	what
011821	you are asking!
011822	Are you able
011823	to drink
011824	
011825	the cup
011826	
011827	
011828	I am about
011829	to drink?”
011830	They said to him,
011831	
011832	“We are able.”
011833	He told them,
011834	
011835	
011836	
011837	my cup,
011838	
011839	“You will drink
011840	
011841	but
011842	to sit
011843	at
011844	my right
011845	
011846	
011847	and at
011848	my left
011849	not
011850	is
011851	mine
011852	
011853	to give.
011854	Rather,
011855	it is for those for whom
011856	it has been prepared
011857	by
011858	
011859	my Father.”
011860	
011861	
011862	heard
011863	
011864	Now when the other ten
011865	this, they were angry
011866	with
011867	
011868	the two
011869	brothers.
011870	
011871	But
011872	Jesus
011873	called them
011874	
011875	and said,
011876	“You know
011877	
011878	
011879	that the rulers
011880	
011881	of the Gentiles
011882	lord it over them,
011883	
011884	
011885	
011886	and those in high positions
011887	use their authority
011888	over them.
011889	It must not
011890	this way
011891	be
011892	among you!
011893	
011894	Instead
011895	whoever
011896	
011897	wants
011898	among
011899	
011900	great
011901	to be
011902	you must be
011903	
011904	your servant,
011905	
011906	and whoever
011907	
011908	wants
011909	among
011910	
011911	to be
011912	first
011913	you must be
011914	
011915	your slave –
011916	just as
011917	
011918	the Son
011919	
011920	of Man
011921	did not
011922	come
011923	to be served
011924	but
011925	to serve,
011926	
011927	and to give
011928	
011929	his life
011930	
011931	as a ransom
011932	for
011933	many.”
011934	
011935	As they were leaving
011936	
011937	
011938	Jericho,
011939	followed them.
011940	
011941	crowd
011942	a large
011943	
011944	
011945	Two
011946	blind men
011947	were sitting
011948	by
011949	
011950	the road.
011951	When they heard
011952	
011953	that Jesus
011954	was passing by,
011955	they shouted,
011956	
011957	“Have mercy on us,
011958	
011959	Lord,
011960	Son
011961	of David!”
011962	
011963	
011964	The crowd
011965	scolded them
011966	
011967	to get them
011968	to be quiet.
011969	
011970	But
011971	even more
011972	they shouted
011973	
011974	have mercy on us,
011975	
011976	loudly, “Lord,
011977	Son
011978	of David!”
011979	
011980	stopped,
011981	
011982	Jesus
011983	called them,
011984	
011985	
011986	and said,
011987	“What
011988	do you want me
011989	to do
011990	for you?”
011991	They said to him,
011992	
011993	“Lord,
011994	let
011995	be opened.”
011996	
011997	our eyes
011998	
011999	Moved with compassion,
012000	
012001	
012002	Jesus
012003	touched
012004	
012005	their eyes.
012006	
012007	
012008	Immediately
012009	they received their sight
012010	
012011	and followed him.
012012	
012013	
012014	Now when
012015	they approached
012016	to
012017	Jerusalem
012018	
012019	and came
012020	at
012021	Bethphage,
012022	
012023	
012024	the Mount
012025	
012026	of Olives,
012027	
012028	Jesus
012029	sent
012030	two
012031	disciples,
012032	telling them,
012033	
012034	“Go
012035	to
012036	
012037	the village
012038	
012039	ahead of you.
012040	
012041	
012042	Right away
012043	you will find
012044	a donkey
012045	tied there,
012046	
012047	and a colt
012048	with her.
012049	
012050	Untie
012051	them and bring them to me.
012052	
012053	
012054	If
012055	anyone
012056	
012057	says
012058	anything to you,
012059	you are to say,
012060	
012061	
012062	‘The Lord
012063	
012064	needs them,’
012065	
012066	at once.”
012067	and
012068	he will send them
012069	
012070	
012071	
012072	This took place
012073	to
012074	fulfill
012075	
012076	
012077	by
012078	
012079	the prophet:
012080	what was spoken
012081	“Tell
012082	
012083	the people
012084	of Zion,
012085	‘Look,
012086	
012087	your king
012088	
012089	is coming to you,
012090	
012091	unassuming
012092	
012093	and seated
012094	on
012095	a donkey,
012096	
012097	and on
012098	a colt,
012099	the foal
012100	of a donkey.’”
012101	went
012102	So
012103	
012104	the disciples
012105	
012106	and did
012107	as
012108	had instructed them.
012109	
012110	
012111	Jesus
012112	They brought
012113	
012114	the donkey
012115	
012116	
012117	and the colt
012118	
012119	and placed
012120	on them,
012121	
012122	
012123	their cloaks
012124	
012125	and he sat
012126	on them.
012127	
012128	
012129	
012130	A very large
012131	crowd
012132	spread
012133	their
012134	
012135	cloaks
012136	on
012137	
012138	the road.
012139	Others
012140	
012141	cut
012142	branches
012143	from
012144	
012145	the trees
012146	
012147	and spread
012148	them on
012149	
012150	the road.
012151	
012152	
012153	The crowds
012154	
012155	that went ahead of him
012156	
012157	
012158	
012159	and those following
012160	kept shouting,
012161	
012162	“Hosanna
012163	
012164	to the Son
012165	of David!
012166	Blessed
012167	
012168	is the one who comes
012169	in
012170	the name
012171	of the Lord!
012172	Hosanna
012173	in
012174	
012175	the highest!”
012176	
012177	As he entered
012178	
012179	
012180	Jerusalem
012181	was thrown into an uproar,
012182	the whole
012183	
012184	city
012185	saying,
012186	“Who
012187	is this?”
012188	
012189	
012190	And
012191	the crowds
012192	were saying,
012193	
012194	“This is
012195	
012196	the prophet
012197	Jesus,
012198	
012199	from
012200	Nazareth
012201	
012202	in Galilee.”
012203	
012204	entered
012205	Then Jesus
012206	
012207	
012208	the temple area
012209	
012210	and drove out
012211	all
012212	
012213	those who were selling
012214	
012215	and buying
012216	in
012217	
012218	the temple courts,
012219	
012220	
012221	the tables
012222	
012223	of the money changers
012224	and turned over
012225	
012226	
012227	and the chairs
012228	
012229	of those selling
012230	
012231	doves.
012232	
012233	And he said to them,
012234	
012235	“It is written,
012236	
012237	‘My house
012238	
012239	a house
012240	of prayer,’
012241	will be called
012242	
012243	but
012244	
012245	you are turning it
012246	into a den
012247	of robbers!”
012248	
012249	came to him
012250	
012251	The blind
012252	
012253	and lame
012254	in
012255	
012256	the temple courts,
012257	
012258	and he healed them.
012259	
012260	saw
012261	But
012262	
012263	when the chief priests
012264	
012265	
012266	and the experts in the law
012267	
012268	the wonderful
012269	things
012270	he did
012271	
012272	
012273	and heard the children
012274	
012275	crying out
012276	in
012277	
012278	the temple courts,
012279	
012280	
012281	“Hosanna
012282	
012283	to the Son
012284	of David,”
012285	they became indignant
012286	
012287	and said to him,
012288	
012289	“Do you hear
012290	what
012291	
012292	“Yes.
012293	
012294	
012295	Jesus
012296	they are saying?”
012297	
012298	said to them,
012299	Have you never
012300	read,
012301	
012302	‘Out of
012303	the mouths
012304	of children
012305	
012306	and nursing infants
012307	you have prepared
012308	praise for yourself’?”
012309	
012310	And leaving them,
012311	
012312	he went out
012313	of
012314	
012315	the city
012316	to
012317	Bethany
012318	
012319	and spent the night
012320	there.
012321	early in the morning,
012322	Now
012323	as he returned
012324	to
012325	
012326	the city,
012327	he was hungry.
012328	
012329	After noticing
012330	fig tree
012331	a
012332	by
012333	
012334	the road
012335	he went
012336	to
012337	
012338	
012339	nothing
012340	it, but found
012341	on it
012342	
012343	
012344	except
012345	leaves.
012346	
012347	
012348	He said to it,
012349	
012350	“Never again
012351	from you!”
012352	
012353	fruit
012354	will there be
012355	
012356	
012357	
012358	
012359	withered
012360	at once.
012361	
012362	And the fig tree
012363	
012364	saw
012365	
012366	When the disciples
012367	it they were amazed,
012368	saying,
012369	“How
012370	so quickly?”
012371	wither
012372	
012373	did the fig tree
012374	answered them,
012375	
012376	
012377	Jesus
012378	
012379	
012380	the truth,
012381	“I tell you
012382	
012383	if
012384	you have
012385	faith
012386	and do
012387	not
012388	doubt,
012389	not
012390	only
012391	
012392	
012393	what was done to the fig tree,
012394	will you do
012395	but
012396	even if
012397	
012398	to this mountain,
012399	
012400	you say
012401	‘Be lifted up
012402	
012403	and thrown
012404	into
012405	
012406	the sea,’
012407	it will happen.
012408	
012409	
012410	And whatever
012411	
012412	you ask
012413	in
012414	
012415	prayer,
012416	if you believe,
012417	you will receive.”
012418	
012419	Now after Jesus entered
012420	
012421	
012422	
012423	the temple courts,
012424	came up to him
012425	
012426	as he was teaching
012427	
012428	the chief priests
012429	
012430	
012431	and elders
012432	
012433	of the people
012434	and said,
012435	
012436	“By what
012437	authority
012438	
012439	are you doing
012440	
012441	these things, and who
012442	
012443	gave you
012444	
012445	this authority?”
012446	
012447	answered them,
012448	
012449	
012450	Jesus
012451	
012452	
012453	ask you
012454	
012455	“I will also
012456	question.
012457	one
012458	
012459	If
012460	you answer me
012461	then I
012462	will also
012463	
012464	tell you
012465	by
012466	what
012467	authority
012468	
012469	I do these things.
012470	
012471	baptism
012472	
012473	John’s
012474	Where
012475	did
012476	come from? From
012477	heaven
012478	or
012479	from
012480	people?”
012481	
012482	
012483	They discussed
012484	this among
012485	themselves,
012486	saying,
012487	“If
012488	we say,
012489	‘From
012490	heaven,’
012491	he will say,
012492	
012493	‘Then
012494	why
012495	
012496	did you not
012497	believe him?’
012498	
012499	if
012500	But
012501	we say,
012502	‘From
012503	people,’
012504	we fear
012505	
012506	the crowd,
012507	they all
012508	for
012509	to be
012510	a prophet.”
012511	consider
012512	
012513	John
012514	
012515	So they answered
012516	
012517	Jesus,
012518	
012519	“We don’t
012520	know.”
012521	Then he said to them,
012522	
012523	
012524	
012525	“Neither
012526	
012527	will I tell you
012528	
012529	by
012530	what
012531	authority
012532	
012533	I am doing these things.
012534	“What
012535	
012536	
012537	do you think?
012538	A man
012539	had
012540	sons.
012541	two
012542	
012543	He went
012544	
012545	to the first
012546	and said,
012547	‘Son,
012548	go
012549	today.’
012550	and work
012551	in
012552	
012553	the vineyard
012554	
012555	
012556	The boy answered,
012557	
012558	not.’
012559	‘I will
012560	later
012561	But
012562	he had a change of heart
012563	and went.
012564	The father went
012565	
012566	
012567	to the other son
012568	and said
012569	the same thing.
012570	
012571	
012572	This boy
012573	answered,
012574	
012575	‘I will, sir,’
012576	
012577	but did not
012578	go.
012579	Which
012580	of
012581	
012582	the two
012583	did
012584	
012585	will?”
012586	
012587	his father’s
012588	They said,
012589	
012590	“The first.”
012591	said to them,
012592	
012593	
012594	Jesus
012595	the truth,
012596	“I tell you
012597	
012598	
012599	
012600	tax collectors
012601	
012602	
012603	and prostitutes
012604	will go ahead of you
012605	
012606	into
012607	
012608	the kingdom
012609	
012610	of God!
012611	came
012612	For
012613	John
012614	to you
012615	
012616	in
012617	the way
012618	of righteousness,
012619	
012620	and you did not
012621	believe him.
012622	
012623	
012624	But
012625	the tax collectors
012626	
012627	
012628	and prostitutes
012629	did believe.
012630	
012631	
012632	Although
012633	you saw
012634	this, you did not
012635	change your minds
012636	later
012637	
012638	and believe him.
012639	
012640	another
012641	parable:
012642	“Listen to
012643	
012644	There was
012645	a landowner
012646	who
012647	planted
012648	a vineyard.
012649	
012650	a fence
012651	
012652	He put
012653	
012654	around it, dug
012655	a pit for
012656	
012657	its winepress,
012658	
012659	and built
012660	a watchtower.
012661	
012662	Then he leased it
012663	
012664	to tenant farmers
012665	
012666	and went on a journey.
012667	When
012668	
012669	was near,
012670	
012671	time
012672	
012673	the harvest
012674	he sent
012675	
012676	his slaves
012677	
012678	to
012679	
012680	the tenants
012681	to collect
012682	
012683	his portion of the crop.
012684	
012685	
012686	seized
012687	
012688	But the tenants
012689	
012690	his slaves,
012691	
012692	one,
012693	
012694	beat
012695	another,
012696	
012697	killed
012698	another.
012699	
012700	and stoned
012701	Again
012702	he sent
012703	other
012704	slaves,
012705	more
012706	
012707	than the first,
012708	
012709	and they treated them
012710	
012711	the same way.
012712	Finally
012713	
012714	he sent
012715	
012716	
012717	
012718	his son to them,
012719	
012720	saying,
012721	‘They will respect
012722	
012723	my son.’
012724	
012725	
012726	But
012727	when the tenants
012728	saw
012729	
012730	the son,
012731	they said
012732	to
012733	themselves,
012734	
012735	‘This is
012736	
012737	the heir.
012738	Come,
012739	let’s kill him
012740	
012741	
012742	and get
012743	
012744	his inheritance!’
012745	
012746	
012747	So they seized him,
012748	
012749	threw him
012750	out of
012751	
012752	the vineyard,
012753	
012754	and killed him.
012755	when
012756	Now
012757	comes,
012758	
012759	the owner
012760	
012761	of the vineyard
012762	what
012763	will he do
012764	
012765	tenants?”
012766	to those
012767	They said to him,
012768	
012769	those evil men!
012770	“He will utterly
012771	destroy
012772	
012773	
012774	
012775	the vineyard
012776	Then he will lease
012777	to other
012778	tenants
012779	who
012780	will give him
012781	
012782	
012783	his portion
012784	at
012785	
012786	the harvest.”
012787	
012788	said to them,
012789	
012790	
012791	Jesus
012792	“Have you never
012793	read
012794	in
012795	
012796	the scriptures:
012797	‘The stone
012798	
012799	rejected
012800	
012801	the builders
012802	
012803	has become
012804	
012805	
012806	the cornerstone.
012807	from
012808	the Lord,
012809	is
012810	This
012811	
012812	and it is
012813	marvelous
012814	in
012815	our eyes’?
012816	
012817	For
012818	
012819	this reason I tell you
012820	
012821	
012822	will be taken
012823	from
012824	
012825	
012826	that the kingdom
012827	
012828	of God
012829	
012830	you and given
012831	to a people
012832	who will produce
012833	
012834	its fruit.
012835	
012836	
012837	
012838	The one who falls
012839	on
012840	
012841	this stone
012842	
012843	will be broken to pieces,
012844	and the one on
012845	whom
012846	
012847	
012848	it falls
012849	will be crushed.”
012850	
012851	
012852	heard
012853	
012854	When the chief priests
012855	
012856	
012857	and the Pharisees
012858	
012859	his parables,
012860	
012861	they realized
012862	
012863	about them.
012864	
012865	that he was speaking
012866	
012867	They wanted
012868	
012869	to arrest him,
012870	but they were afraid
012871	
012872	of the crowds,
012873	because
012874	as
012875	a prophet.
012876	
012877	the crowds regarded him
012878	
012879	
012880	
012881	Jesus
012882	again
012883	saying:
012884	in
012885	parables,
012886	
012887	spoke to them
012888	can be compared
012889	
012890	“The kingdom
012891	
012892	of heaven
012893	
012894	to a king
012895	who
012896	gave
012897	a wedding banquet
012898	
012899	for his son.
012900	
012901	
012902	He sent
012903	
012904	his slaves
012905	
012906	to summon
012907	
012908	those who had been invited
012909	to
012910	
012911	the banquet,
012912	
012913	not
012914	but they would
012915	come.
012916	Again
012917	he sent
012918	other
012919	slaves,
012920	saying,
012921	‘Tell
012922	
012923	those who have been invited,
012924	“Look!
012925	
012926	The feast
012927	
012928	I have prepared
012929	
012930	for you is ready. My oxen
012931	
012932	
012933	
012934	and fattened cattle
012935	have been slaughtered,
012936	
012937	and everything
012938	is ready.
012939	Come
012940	to
012941	
012942	the wedding banquet.”’
012943	
012944	But
012945	they were indifferent
012946	and went away,
012947	one
012948	
012949	to
012950	
012951	his
012952	farm,
012953	another
012954	
012955	to
012956	
012957	his business.
012958	
012959	
012960	
012961	The rest
012962	seized
012963	
012964	his slaves,
012965	
012966	insolently mistreated them,
012967	
012968	and killed them.
012969	
012970	The
012971	king
012972	was furious!
012973	
012974	He sent
012975	
012976	his soldiers,
012977	
012978	and they put
012979	
012980	murderers to death
012981	those
012982	and set
012983	
012984	their city
012985	
012986	on fire.
012987	Then
012988	he said
012989	
012990	to his slaves,
012991	
012992	
012993	
012994	‘The wedding
012995	ready,
012996	is
012997	
012998	but
012999	the ones who had been invited
013000	not
013001	were
013002	worthy.
013003	go
013004	So
013005	into
013006	
013007	the main
013008	
013009	streets
013010	
013011	everyone
013012	
013013	you find
013014	and invite
013015	to
013016	
013017	the wedding banquet.’
013018	
013019	went out
013020	
013021	slaves
013022	And those
013023	into
013024	
013025	the streets
013026	and gathered
013027	all
013028	
013029	they found,
013030	bad
013031	both
013032	
013033	and good,
013034	
013035	was filled
013036	
013037	and the wedding hall
013038	with guests.
013039	came in
013040	But
013041	
013042	when the king
013043	to see
013044	
013045	the wedding guests,
013046	he saw
013047	there
013048	a man
013049	who was not
013050	wearing
013051	clothes.
013052	wedding
013053	
013054	And he said to him,
013055	
013056	‘Friend,
013057	how
013058	did you get in
013059	
013060	here
013061	without
013062	clothes?’
013063	wedding
013064	
013065	But
013066	he had nothing to say.
013067	Then
013068	
013069	the king
013070	said
013071	
013072	to his attendants,
013073	‘Tie him
013074	
013075	and foot
013076	
013077	up hand
013078	and throw him
013079	
013080	into
013081	
013082	
013083	
013084	the outer darkness,
013085	where there
013086	will be
013087	
013088	weeping
013089	
013090	
013091	and gnashing
013092	
013093	of teeth!’
013094	many
013095	For
013096	are
013097	called,
013098	few
013099	but
013100	are chosen.”
013101	Then
013102	went out
013103	
013104	the Pharisees
013105	and planned together
013106	
013107	
013108	
013109	to entrap him
013110	with
013111	his own words.
013112	
013113	They sent to him
013114	
013115	
013116	their disciples
013117	
013118	along with
013119	
013120	the Herodians,
013121	saying,
013122	“Teacher,
013123	we know
013124	
013125	truthful,
013126	that you are
013127	
013128	
013129	the way
013130	
013131	of God
013132	in accordance with
013133	the truth.
013134	and teach
013135	
013136	You do not
013137	court
013138	
013139	
013140	anyone’s
013141	no
013142	favor because
013143	you show
013144	
013145	partiality.
013146	
013147	Tell us
013148	then,
013149	
013150	what
013151	
013152	do you think?
013153	Is it right
013154	to pay
013155	taxes
013156	to Caesar
013157	or
013158	not?”
013159	realized
013160	But
013161	
013162	Jesus
013163	
013164	their evil intentions
013165	
013166	and said,
013167	Why
013168	
013169	are you testing me?
013170	“Hypocrites!
013171	Show me
013172	
013173	
013174	the coin
013175	
013176	used for the tax.”
013177	
013178	So
013179	they brought him
013180	
013181	a denarius.
013182	
013183	Jesus said to them,
013184	
013185	“Whose
013186	
013187	image is this,
013188	
013189	
013190	
013191	and whose inscription?”
013192	They replied,
013193	
013194	“Caesar’s.”
013195	
013196	He said to them,
013197	
013198	“Then
013199	
013200	
013201	the things that are Caesar’s,
013202	give to Caesar
013203	
013204	
013205	
013206	and to God
013207	
013208	the things that are God’s.”
013209	
013210	Now when they heard
013211	this they were stunned,
013212	
013213	and they left him
013214	
013215	and went away.
013216	
013217	The same
013218	
013219	day
013220	came to him
013221	
013222	Sadducees
013223	(who say
013224	no
013225	there is
013226	resurrection)
013227	
013228	and asked him,
013229	
013230	
013231	“Teacher,
013232	Moses
013233	said,
013234	‘If
013235	a man
013236	dies
013237	without
013238	having
013239	children,
013240	must marry
013241	
013242	his brother
013243	
013244	
013245	the widow
013246	
013247	
013248	and father
013249	children
013250	
013251	for his brother.’
013252	
013253	there were
013254	Now
013255	among us.
013256	
013257	seven
013258	brothers
013259	
013260	
013261	The first one
013262	married
013263	and died,
013264	
013265	no
013266	and since he had
013267	children
013268	he left
013269	
013270	his wife
013271	
013272	
013273	to his brother.
013274	
013275	did the same,
013276	
013277	
013278	The second
013279	
013280	
013281	and the third,
013282	down to
013283	
013284	the seventh.
013285	Last
013286	
013287	of all,
013288	died.
013289	
013290	the woman
013291	In
013292	
013293	the resurrection,
013294	therefore,
013295	whose
013296	
013297	wife of the seven
013298	be?
013299	will she
013300	they all
013301	For
013302	had married her.”
013303	
013304	answered them,
013305	
013306	
013307	Jesus
013308	
013309	
013310	“You are deceived,
013311	because you don’t
013312	know
013313	
013314	the scriptures
013315	or
013316	
013317	the power
013318	
013319	of God.
013320	in
013321	For
013322	
013323	the resurrection
013324	they neither
013325	marry
013326	nor
013327	are given in marriage,
013328	but
013329	like
013330	angels
013331	in
013332	
013333	heaven.
013334	are
013335	as for
013336	Now
013337	
013338	the resurrection
013339	
013340	of the dead,
013341	have you not
013342	read
013343	
013344	
013345	
013346	by
013347	
013348	God,
013349	what was spoken to you
013350	
013351	‘I am
013352	
013353	the God
013354	of Abraham,
013355	
013356	
013357	the God
013358	of Isaac,
013359	
013360	
013361	and the God
013362	of Jacob’?
013363	not
013364	He is
013365	
013366	the God
013367	of the dead
013368	but
013369	of the living!”
013370	
013371	heard
013372	
013373	When the crowds
013374	this, they were amazed
013375	at
013376	
013377	his teaching.
013378	
013379	
013380	Now
013381	when the Pharisees
013382	heard
013383	
013384	that he had silenced
013385	
013386	the Sadducees,
013387	they assembled together.
013388	
013389	
013390	
013391	
013392	asked him a question
013393	And one
013394	of them,
013395	
013396	an expert in religious law,
013397	to test him:
013398	
013399	“Teacher,
013400	which
013401	commandment
013402	is the greatest?”
013403	in
013404	
013405	the law
013406	
013407	
013408	Jesus said to him,
013409	
013410	“‘Love
013411	the Lord
013412	
013413	your God
013414	
013415	with
013416	all
013417	
013418	your heart,
013419	
013420	
013421	with
013422	all
013423	
013424	your soul,
013425	
013426	
013427	and with
013428	all
013429	
013430	your mind.’
013431	
013432	
013433	This is
013434	
013435	and greatest
013436	
013437	the first
013438	commandment.
013439	The second
013440	
013441	is like
013442	
013443	it: ‘Love
013444	
013445	your neighbor
013446	
013447	as
013448	yourself.’
013449	on
013450	
013451	
013452	these two
013453	commandments.”
013454	All
013455	
013456	the law
013457	depend
013458	
013459	
013460	and the prophets
013461	were assembled,
013462	
013463	
013464	While the Pharisees
013465	a question:
013466	asked them
013467	
013468	Jesus
013469	he?” They said,
013470	“What
013471	
013472	do you think
013473	about
013474	
013475	the Christ?
013476	Whose
013477	son
013478	is
013479	
013480	
013481	
013482	“The son of David.”
013483	He said to them,
013484	
013485	“How
013486	then
013487	does David
013488	by
013489	the Spirit
013490	call him
013491	
013492	‘Lord,’
013493	saying,
013494	said
013495	‘The Lord
013496	
013497	to my lord,
013498	
013499	“Sit
013500	at
013501	my right hand,
013502	
013503	until
013504	
013505	I put
013506	
013507	your enemies
013508	
013509	under
013510	
013511	your feet”’?
013512	
013513	If
013514	then
013515	David
013516	calls him
013517	
013518	‘Lord,’
013519	how
013520	his son?”

014231	another.
014232	
014233	
014234	All will be torn down!”
014235	As he was sitting
014236	
014237	
014238	on
014239	
014240	the Mount
014241	
014242	of Olives,
014243	came to him
014244	
014245	
014246	his disciples
014247	
014248	privately
014249	and said,
014250	“Tell us,
014251	
014252	when
014253	
014254	will these things happen?
014255	
014256	And what will be
014257	
014258	the sign
014259	
014260	of your
014261	coming
014262	
014263	and of the end
014264	
014265	of the age?”
014266	
014267	answered them,
014268	
014269	Jesus
014270	
014271	
014272	“Watch out
014273	that no
014274	one
014275	
014276	misleads you.
014277	many
014278	For
014279	will come
014280	in
014281	
014282	my name,
014283	
014284	saying,
014285	
014286	‘I am
014287	
014288	the Christ,’
014289	
014290	many.
014291	and they will mislead
014292	You will
014293	
014294	hear
014295	of wars
014296	
014297	and rumors
014298	of wars.
014299	Make sure
014300	that you are not
014301	alarmed,
014302	this must
014303	for
014304	happen,
014305	but
014306	still to come.
014307	is
014308	
014309	the end
014310	will rise up
014311	For
014312	nation
014313	in arms against
014314	nation,
014315	
014316	and kingdom
014317	against
014318	kingdom.
014319	
014320	And there will be
014321	famines
014322	
014323	and earthquakes
014324	in
014325	various places.
014326	All
014327	
014328	
014329	these things are the beginning
014330	of birth pains.
014331	“Then
014332	they will hand
014333	you over
014334	to
014335	be persecuted
014336	
014337	and will kill you.
014338	
014339	
014340	You will be
014341	hated
014342	by
014343	all
014344	
014345	the nations
014346	because of
014347	
014348	my name.
014349	
014350	
014351	Then
014352	will be led into sin,
014353	many
014354	
014355	one another
014356	and they will betray
014357	
014358	and hate
014359	one another.
014360	
014361	And many
014362	false prophets
014363	will appear
014364	
014365	and deceive
014366	many,
014367	
014368	and because
014369	
014370	will increase so much,
014371	
014372	lawlessness
014373	will grow cold.
014374	
014375	the love
014376	
014377	of many
014378	
014379	But
014380	the person who endures
014381	to
014382	the end
014383	
014384	will be saved.
014385	
014386	will be preached
014387	
014388	
014389	And this gospel
014390	
014391	of the kingdom
014392	throughout
014393	the whole
014394	
014395	inhabited earth
014396	as
014397	a testimony
014398	to all
014399	
014400	the nations,
014401	
014402	and then
014403	will come.
014404	
014405	the end
014406	when
014407	“So
014408	you see
014409	
014410	the abomination
014411	
014412	of desolation –
014413	
014414	spoken
014415	about by
014416	Daniel

014427	
014428	those in

014430	Judea

014434	the mountains.
014435	
014436	The one on

014495	
014496	now,
014497	or
014498	
014499	ever
014500	will happen.
014501	
014502	And if
014503	had not

014530	or
014531	‘There

014553	ahead of time.
014554	I have told you

014569	the inner rooms,’

014572	just like

015650	just as
015651	you did
015652	it for one
015653	
015654	
015655	of these brothers or sisters
015656	
015657	
015658	of the least
015659	
015660	of mine, you did it for me.’
015661	“Then
015662	he will say
015663	
015664	
015665	to those on
015666	his left,
015667	‘Depart
015668	from me,
015669	
015670	
015671	you accursed,
015672	into
015673	
015674	fire
015675	
015676	the eternal
015677	
015678	that has been prepared
015679	
015680	for the devil
015681	
015682	
015683	and his angels!
015684	
015685	I was hungry
015686	For
015687	
015688	nothing
015689	and you gave me
015690	
015691	to eat,
015692	I was thirsty
015693	and you gave me
015694	nothing
015695	to drink.
015696	
015697	a stranger
015698	I was
015699	
015700	and you did not
015701	receive
015702	me as a guest,
015703	naked
015704	
015705	and you did not
015706	clothe me,
015707	
015708	sick
015709	
015710	and in
015711	prison
015712	
015713	and you did not
015714	visit me.’
015715	
015716	Then
015717	they too will answer,
015718	
015719	
015720	
015721	‘Lord,
015722	when
015723	
015724	did we see
015725	you hungry
015726	or
015727	thirsty
015728	or
015729	a stranger
015730	or
015731	naked
015732	or
015733	sick
015734	or
015735	in
015736	prison,
015737	
015738	and did not
015739	give you
015740	whatever you needed?’
015741	Then
015742	he will answer them,
015743	
015744	‘I tell you
015745	the truth,
015746	
015747	
015748	
015749	just as
015750	you did not
015751	do
015752	it for one
015753	
015754	
015755	of the least of these,
015756	you did not
015757	
015758	do it for me.’
015759	
015760	And these will depart
015761	
015762	into
015763	punishment,
015764	eternal
015765	
015766	but
015767	the righteous
015768	into
015769	life.”
015770	eternal
015771	
015772	
015773	When
015774	had finished
015775	
015776	Jesus
015777	saying all
015778	
015779	these things,
015780	
015781	he told
015782	
015783	his disciples,
015784	
015785	“You know
015786	
015787	that after
015788	two
015789	days
015790	
015791	the Passover
015792	is coming,
015793	
015794	
015795	and the Son
015796	
015797	of Man
015798	will be handed over
015799	to
015800	
015801	be crucified.”
015802	Then
015803	met together
015804	
015805	the chief priests
015806	
015807	
015808	and the elders
015809	
015810	of the people
015811	in
015812	
015813	the palace
015814	
015815	of the high priest,
015816	
015817	who was named
015818	Caiaphas.
015819	
015820	They planned
015821	to
015822	
015823	Jesus
015824	by stealth
015825	arrest
015826	
015827	and kill him.
015828	they said,
015829	But
015830	“Not
015831	during
015832	
015833	the feast,
015834	so that
015835	there won’t
015836	a riot
015837	be
015838	among
015839	
015840	the people.”
015841	
015842	Now
015843	while Jesus
015844	was
015845	in
015846	Bethany
015847	at
015848	the house
015849	of Simon
015850	
015851	the leper,
015852	came to him
015853	
015854	a woman
015855	with
015856	an alabaster jar
015857	perfumed oil,
015858	of expensive
015859	
015860	and she poured
015861	it on
015862	
015863	his head
015864	
015865	as he was at the table.
015866	saw
015867	
015868	
015869	When the disciples
015870	this, they became indignant
015871	and said,
015872	
015873	“Why
015874	
015875	this waste?
015876	
015877	It could
015878	
015879	
015880	have been sold
015881	at a high price
015882	
015883	and the money given
015884	to the poor!”
015885	learned of this,
015886	
015887	
015888	When Jesus
015889	he said to them,
015890	
015891	“Why
015892	
015893	are you bothering
015894	
015895	this woman?
015896	service
015897	
015898	a good
015899	She has done
015900	for me.
015901	
015902	you will always
015903	For
015904	
015905	the poor
015906	have
015907	with
015908	you,
015909	
015910	but
015911	you will not
015912	always
015913	have me!
015914	When she poured
015915	
015916	
015917	
015918	this oil
015919	
015920	on
015921	
015922	my body,
015923	
015924	it to
015925	
015926	for burial.
015927	prepare me
015928	she did
015929	the truth,
015930	I tell you
015931	
015932	wherever
015933	
015934	is proclaimed
015935	
015936	this gospel
015937	
015938	in
015939	the whole
015940	
015941	world,
015942	will also be told
015943	
015944	what
015945	she has done
015946	
015947	in
015948	memory of her.”
015949	
015950	Then
015951	went
015952	one
015953	
015954	of the twelve,
015955	
015956	the one named
015957	Judas
015958	Iscariot,
015959	to
015960	
015961	the chief priests
015962	and said,
015963	“What
015964	will
015965	
015966	you give me
015967	
015968	
015969	to betray him
015970	
015971	
015972	into your hands?” So
015973	they set out
015974	
015975	thirty
015976	silver coins for him.
015977	
015978	From
015979	that time on,
015980	Judas began looking for
015981	an opportunity
015982	to
015983	
015984	betray him.
015985	
015986	Now
015987	on the first
015988	
015989	day of the feast of Unleavened Bread
015990	came
015991	
015992	the disciples
015993	
015994	to Jesus
015995	and said,
015996	“Where
015997	do you want
015998	us to prepare for you
015999	
016000	to eat
016001	
016002	the Passover?”
016003	
016004	
016005	He said,
016006	“Go
016007	into
016008	
016009	the city
016010	to
016011	
016012	a certain man
016013	
016014	and tell him,
016015	
016016	
016017	‘The Teacher
016018	says,
016019	
016020	“My time
016021	
016022	near.
016023	is
016024	at your house.”’”
016025	
016026	I will observe
016027	
016028	the Passover
016029	with
016030	
016031	my disciples
016032	
016033	
016034	did
016035	
016036	So the disciples
016037	as
016038	had instructed them,
016039	
016040	
016041	Jesus
016042	
016043	and they prepared
016044	
016045	the Passover.
016046	evening,
016047	
016048	When it was
016049	he took his place at the table
016050	with
016051	
016052	the twelve.
016053	
016054	And while they were eating
016055	
016056	“I tell you
016057	the truth,
016058	he said,
016059	
016060	
016061	one
016062	of
016063	
016064	you will betray me.”
016065	
016066	
016067	distressed
016068	They became greatly
016069	began
016070	to say to him,
016071	
016072	one
016073	and each
016074	“Surely not
016075	
016076	
016077	I, Lord?”
016078	
016079	
016080	He answered,
016081	
016082	
016083	“The one who has dipped
016084	with me
016085	
016086	
016087	his hand
016088	into
016089	
016090	the bowl
016091	
016092	
016093	will betray me.
016094	
016095	
016096	The Son
016097	
016098	of Man
016099	will go
016100	as
016101	it is written
016102	about him,
016103	
016104	woe
016105	but
016106	
016107	man
016108	to that
016109	by
016110	whom
016111	
016112	the Son
016113	
016114	of Man
016115	is betrayed!
016116	better for him
016117	It would be
016118	
016119	if
016120	he had never
016121	been born.”
016122	
016123	
016124	
016125	
016126	Then
016127	Judas,
016128	
016129	the one who would betray him,
016130	
016131	said,
016132	“Surely not
016133	
016134	
016135	I, Rabbi?”
016136	Jesus replied,
016137	
016138	
016139	“You have said it yourself.”
016140	While they were eating,
016141	
016142	
016143	took
016144	
016145	Jesus
016146	bread,
016147	
016148	and after giving thanks
016149	he broke
016150	
016151	it, gave
016152	
016153	it to his disciples,
016154	and said,
016155	“Take,
016156	eat,
016157	
016158	this is
016159	
016160	my body.”
016161	
016162	
016163	And after taking
016164	the cup
016165	
016166	and giving thanks,
016167	he gave it to them,
016168	
016169	saying,
016170	“Drink
016171	from it,
016172	
016173	all of you,
016174	
016175	for
016176	this is
016177	
016178	my blood,
016179	
016180	
016181	the blood of the covenant,
016182	
016183	for
016184	many
016185	that is poured out
016186	for
016187	the forgiveness
016188	of sins.
016189	I tell you,
016190	
016191	
016192	
016193	I will not
016194	drink
016195	from
016196	now on
016197	of
016198	
016199	
016200	this fruit
016201	
016202	of the vine
016203	until
016204	
016205	day
016206	that
016207	when
016208	
016209	I drink it
016210	with you
016211	
016212	new
016213	in
016214	
016215	kingdom.”
016216	
016217	my Father’s
016218	
016219	
016220	After singing a hymn,
016221	they went out
016222	to
016223	
016224	the Mount
016225	
016226	of Olives.
016227	Then
016228	said to them,
016229	
016230	
016231	Jesus
016232	will all
016233	
016234	fall away
016235	because of me,
016236	
016237	
016238	
016239	“This night you
016240	
016241	it is written:
016242	for
016243	‘I will strike
016244	
016245	the shepherd,
016246	
016247	will be scattered.’
016248	
016249	and the sheep
016250	
016251	of the flock
016252	after
016253	But
016254	
016255	I am raised,
016256	
016257	I will go ahead of you
016258	
016259	into
016260	
016261	Galilee.”
016262	
016263	
016264	
016265	Peter
016266	said to him,
016267	
016268	“If
016269	they all
016270	fall away
016271	because of you,
016272	
016273	
016274	I will never
016275	fall away!”
016276	said to him,
016277	
016278	
016279	Jesus
016280	the truth,
016281	“I tell you
016282	
016283	
016284	on
016285	
016286	
016287	this night,
016288	before
016289	the rooster
016290	crows,
016291	three times.”
016292	you will deny me
016293	
016294	said to him,
016295	
016296	
016297	Peter
016298	“Even if
016299	I must
016300	
016301	with you,
016302	
016303	die
016304	
016305	I will never
016306	
016307	deny you.”
016308	the same thing.
016309	
016310	And all
016311	
016312	the disciples
016313	said
016314	Then
016315	went
016316	with them
016317	
016318	
016319	Jesus
016320	to
016321	a place
016322	called
016323	Gethsemane,
016324	
016325	and he said
016326	
016327	to the disciples,
016328	“Sit
016329	here
016330	while
016331	
016332	I go over
016333	there
016334	and pray.”
016335	
016336	He took with
016337	
016338	him Peter
016339	
016340	
016341	and the two
016342	sons
016343	of Zebedee,
016344	and became
016345	anguished
016346	
016347	and distressed.
016348	Then
016349	he said to them,
016350	
016351	deeply grieved,
016352	is
016353	
016354	soul
016355	“My
016356	even to the point of
016357	death.
016358	Remain
016359	here
016360	
016361	and stay awake
016362	with me.”
016363	
016364	
016365	Going
016366	a little farther,
016367	he threw himself down
016368	with
016369	his face
016370	
016371	to the ground and prayed,
016372	
016373	
016374	“My Father,
016375	
016376	if
016377	possible,
016378	
016379	pass
016380	from me!
016381	
016382	
016383	let this cup
016384	
016385	Yet
016386	not
016387	what
016388	
016389	I will,
016390	but
016391	what you will.”
016392	
016393	
016394	Then he came
016395	to
016396	
016397	the disciples
016398	
016399	and found them
016400	
016401	sleeping.
016402	
016403	He said
016404	
016405	to Peter,
016406	“So,
016407	couldn’t
016408	you stay awake
016409	for one
016410	hour?
016411	
016412	with me
016413	
016414	Stay awake
016415	
016416	and pray
016417	that
016418	you will not
016419	fall
016420	into
016421	temptation.
016422	
016423	
016424	The spirit
016425	is willing,
016426	
016427	but
016428	the flesh
016429	is weak.”
016430	
016431	
016432	a second time
016433	He went away
016434	and prayed,
016435	
016436	“My Father,
016437	
016438	if
016439	
016440	this cup cannot
016441	
016442	be taken away
016443	
016444	unless
016445	
016446	I drink it,
016447	must be done.”
016448	
016449	your will
016450	
016451	
016452	He came
016453	again
016454	and found them
016455	
016456	sleeping;
016457	they could
016458	
016459	
016460	
016461	their eyes open.
016462	not keep
016463	
016464	So leaving them
016465	
016466	again,
016467	he went away
016468	and prayed
016469	for
016470	the third time,
016471	
016472	
016473	
016474	saying
016475	the same thing once more.
016476	Then
016477	he came
016478	to
016479	
016480	the disciples
016481	
016482	and said to them,
016483	
016484	sleeping
016485	
016486	“Are you still
016487	
016488	and resting?
016489	Look,
016490	is approaching,
016491	
016492	the hour
016493	
016494	
016495	and the Son
016496	
016497	of Man
016498	is betrayed
016499	into
016500	the hands
016501	of sinners.
016502	Get up,
016503	let us go.
016504	Look!
016505	is approaching!”
016506	
016507	My betrayer
016508	
016509	
016510	While he was still
016511	
016512	speaking,
016513	
016514	Judas,
016515	one
016516	
016517	of the twelve,
016518	arrived.
016519	
016520	With him
016521	
016522	crowd
016523	was a large
016524	armed with
016525	swords
016526	
016527	and clubs,
016528	sent by
016529	
016530	the chief priests
016531	
016532	and elders
016533	
016534	of the people.
016535	
016536	(Now
016537	the betrayer
016538	
016539	had given them
016540	
016541	a sign,
016542	saying,
016543	“The one
016544	
016545	I kiss
016546	
016547	is
016548	the man. Arrest him!”)
016549	
016550	
016551	Immediately
016552	he went up
016553	
016554	to Jesus
016555	and said,
016556	“Greetings,
016557	Rabbi,”
016558	
016559	and kissed him.
016560	
016561	
016562	
016563	Jesus
016564	said to him,
016565	
016566	“Friend,
016567	of
016568	do what
016569	you are here
016570	to do.” Then
016571	they came
016572	and took
016573	
016574	hold
016575	
016576	
016577	Jesus
016578	
016579	and arrested him.
016580	
016581	
016582	
016583	But one
016584	
016585	of those with
016586	Jesus
016587	drew it out,
016588	
016589	
016590	grabbed
016591	
016592	his sword,
016593	
016594	
016595	and struck
016596	
016597	slave,
016598	
016599	the high priest’s
016600	cutting off
016601	
016602	
016603	his ear.
016604	Then
016605	said to him,
016606	
016607	
016608	Jesus
016609	“Put
016610	
016611	your sword
016612	
016613	back in
016614	
016615	its place!
016616	
016617	all
016618	For
016619	
016620	who take hold
016621	of the sword
016622	by
016623	the sword.
016624	will die
016625	Or
016626	do you think
016627	
016628	
016629	that I cannot
016630	call on
016631	
016632	my Father,
016633	
016634	
016635	and that he would send me
016636	
016637	right now?
016638	more
016639	than twelve
016640	legions
016641	of angels
016642	How
016643	then
016644	be fulfilled?”
016645	
016646	would the scriptures
016647	
016648	this way
016649	that say it must
016650	happen
016651	At
016652	that
016653	
016654	moment
016655	said
016656	
016657	Jesus
016658	
016659	to the crowd,
016660	like
016661	
016662	you would an outlaw?
016663	“Have you come out
016664	with
016665	swords
016666	
016667	and clubs
016668	to arrest me
016669	
016670	Day after
016671	day
016672	in
016673	
016674	the temple courts,
016675	I sat
016676	teaching
016677	
016678	yet you did not
016679	arrest me.
016680	
016681	
016682	But
016683	
016684	this has happened
016685	so that
016686	would be fulfilled.”
016687	
016688	the scriptures
016689	
016690	of the prophets
016691	Then
016692	
016693	the disciples
016694	all
016695	left him
016696	
016697	and fled.
016698	
016699	Now
016700	the ones who had arrested
016701	
016702	Jesus
016703	led
016704	him to
016705	Caiaphas,
016706	
016707	the high priest,
016708	in whose house
016709	
016710	the experts in the law
016711	
016712	
016713	and the elders
016714	had gathered.
016715	
016716	But
016717	Peter
016718	was following him
016719	
016720	from
016721	a distance,
016722	all the way to
016723	
016724	courtyard.
016725	
016726	the high priest’s
016727	
016728	After going
016729	in,
016730	he sat
016731	with
016732	
016733	the guards
016734	to see
016735	
016736	the outcome.
016737	
016738	
016739	The chief priests
016740	
016741	
016742	Sanhedrin
016743	and the whole
016744	were trying to find
016745	false testimony
016746	against
016747	
016748	Jesus
016749	so that
016750	they could put him
016751	to death.
016752	
016753	But they did not
016754	find anything,
016755	though many
016756	came forward.
016757	false witnesses
016758	Finally
016759	
016760	came forward
016761	two
016762	and declared,
016763	
016764	“This man said,
016765	‘I am able
016766	to destroy
016767	
016768	the temple
016769	
016770	of God
016771	
016772	it in
016773	three
016774	days.’”
016775	and rebuild
016776	
016777	stood up
016778	
016779	So the high priest
016780	and said to him,
016781	
016782	“Have you no
016783	answer?
016784	What
016785	
016786	
016787	is this that they are testifying against you?”
016788	
016789	But
016790	Jesus
016791	was silent.
016792	
016793	
016794	The high priest
016795	said to him,
016796	
016797	under oath
016798	“I charge you
016799	by
016800	
016801	God,
016802	
016803	the living
016804	
016805	
016806	tell us
016807	if
016808	
016809	you are
016810	
016811	the Christ,
016812	
016813	the Son
016814	
016815	of God.”
016816	said to him,
016817	
016818	
016819	Jesus
016820	
016821	“You have said
016822	it yourself. But
016823	I tell you,
016824	
016825	from
016826	now on
016827	you will see
016828	
016829	the Son
016830	
016831	of Man
016832	sitting
016833	at
016834	the right hand
016835	
016836	of the Power
016837	
016838	and coming
016839	on
016840	
016841	the clouds
016842	
016843	of heaven.”
016844	Then
016845	
016846	the high priest
016847	tore
016848	
016849	his clothes
016850	
016851	and declared,
016852	“He has blasphemed!
016853	Why
016854	do we still
016855	need
016856	
016857	witnesses?
016858	
016859	Now
016860	you have heard
016861	
016862	the blasphemy!
016863	What
016864	
016865	is your verdict?”
016866	
016867	
016868	They answered,
016869	
016870	guilty
016871	and deserves death.”
016872	“He is
016873	Then
016874	they spat
016875	in
016876	
016877	his face
016878	
016879	
016880	and struck
016881	him with their fists.
016882	some
016883	And
016884	slapped him,
016885	saying,
016886	“Prophesy for us,
016887	
016888	you Christ!
016889	Who
016890	
016891	
016892	hit you?”
016893	
016894	
016895	Now
016896	Peter
016897	was sitting
016898	outside
016899	in
016900	
016901	the courtyard.
016902	
016903	came to him
016904	
016905	
016906	A slave girl
016907	and said,
016908	
016909	
016910	“You also were
016911	with
016912	Jesus
016913	
016914	the Galilean.”
016915	
016916	But
016917	he denied
016918	it in front of
016919	them all:
016920	you’re talking about!”
016921	
016922	“I don’t know
016923	what
016924	
016925	When he went out
016926	
016927	to
016928	
016929	the gateway,
016930	slave girl saw him
016931	
016932	another
016933	
016934	and said
016935	
016936	to the people there,
016937	
016938	“This man was
016939	with
016940	Jesus
016941	
016942	the Nazarene.”
016943	
016944	it again
016945	He denied
016946	with
016947	an oath,
016948	
016949	“I do not
016950	know
016951	
016952	the man!”
016953	After
016954	a little while,
016955	
016956	there came up
016957	
016958	those standing
016959	and said,
016960	
016961	to Peter
016962	“You really
016963	
016964	
016965	one of them
016966	
016967	are
016968	
016969	
016970	
016971	too – even your accent
016972	
016973	away!”
016974	
016975	gives you
016976	At that
016977	he began
016978	to curse,
016979	
016980	and he swore with an oath,
016981	
016982	“I do not
016983	know
016984	
016985	the man!”
016986	
016987	At that moment
016988	a rooster
016989	crowed.
016990	
016991	remembered
016992	
016993	Then Peter
016994	
016995	
016996	what Jesus
016997	had said:
016998	
016999	“Before
017000	the rooster
017001	crows,
017002	three times.”
017003	you will deny me
017004	
017005	
017006	And he went
017007	outside
017008	and wept
017009	bitterly.
017010	early in the morning,
017011	
017012	When it was
017013	plotted
017014	
017015	all
017016	
017017	the chief priests
017018	
017019	
017020	and the elders
017021	
017022	of the people
017023	against
017024	
017025	Jesus
017026	to
017027	execute him.
017028	
017029	
017030	They tied
017031	him up,
017032	led him away,
017033	
017034	and handed him over
017035	to Pilate
017036	
017037	the governor.
017038	Now
017039	saw
017040	when Judas,
017041	
017042	who had betrayed him,
017043	
017044	
017045	that Jesus had been condemned,
017046	he regretted
017047	what he had done and returned
017048	
017049	the thirty
017050	silver coins
017051	
017052	to the chief priests
017053	
017054	and the elders,
017055	saying,
017056	“I have sinned
017057	by betraying
017058	blood!”
017059	innocent
017060	
017061	But
017062	they said,
017063	“What
017064	is that to us?
017065	
017066	
017067	You take care of it yourself!”
017068	
017069	So Judas threw
017070	
017071	the silver coins
017072	into
017073	
017074	the temple
017075	and left.
017076	
017077	Then he went out
017078	and hanged himself.
017079	
017080	
017081	The chief priests
017082	took
017083	
017084	the silver
017085	and said,
017086	“It is not
017087	lawful
017088	to put
017089	
017090	this into
017091	
017092	the temple treasury,
017093	since
017094	money.”
017095	blood
017096	it is
017097	After consulting together
017098	
017099	
017100	they bought
017101	with it,
017102	
017103	
017104	Field
017105	
017106	the Potter’s
017107	as
017108	a burial place
017109	
017110	for foreigners.
017111	For this reason
017112	has been called
017113	
017114	field
017115	that
017116	the “Field
017117	of Blood”
017118	to
017119	
017120	this day.
017121	Then
017122	was fulfilled:
017123	
017124	what was spoken
017125	by
017126	Jeremiah
017127	
017128	the prophet
017129	
017130	
017131	“They took
017132	
017133	the thirty
017134	silver coins,
017135	
017136	
017137	
017138	the price
017139	of the one whose
017140	price had been set
017141	by
017142	the people
017143	of Israel,
017144	
017145	and they gave them
017146	
017147	for
017148	
017149	field,
017150	
017151	the potter’s
017152	as
017153	commanded me.”
017154	
017155	the Lord
017156	
017157	Then
017158	Jesus
017159	stood
017160	before
017161	
017162	the governor,
017163	
017164	asked him,
017165	
017166	
017167	and the governor
017168	“You say so.”
017169	
017170	“Are you
017171	
017172	the king
017173	
017174	of the Jews?”
017175	
017176	
017177	Jesus
017178	said,
017179	
017180	
017181	
017182	But when
017183	
017184	he was accused
017185	
017186	by
017187	
017188	the chief priests
017189	
017190	and the elders,
017191	he did not
017192	respond.
017193	Then
017194	said to him,
017195	
017196	
017197	Pilate
017198	“Don’t
017199	you hear
017200	how many
017201	
017202	charges they are bringing against you?”
017203	
017204	But he did not
017205	answer
017206	
017207	
017208	even
017209	one
017210	accusation,
017211	so that
017212	amazed.
017213	
017214	the governor
017215	was quite
017216	During
017217	
017218	the feast
017219	was accustomed
017220	
017221	the governor
017222	to release
017223	one
017224	
017225	to the crowd,
017226	prisoner
017227	whomever
017228	they wanted.
017229	they had
017230	
017231	At that time
017232	prisoner
017233	in custody a notorious
017234	named
017235	Jesus
017236	Barabbas.
017237	after they had assembled,
017238	So
017239	
017240	said to them,
017241	
017242	
017243	Pilate
017244	“Whom
017245	do you want
017246	me to release for you,
017247	
017248	Jesus
017249	
017250	Barabbas
017251	or
017252	Jesus
017253	
017254	the Christ?”
017255	who is called
017256	he knew
017257	(For
017258	
017259	because of
017260	envy.)
017261	that they had handed
017262	him over
017263	was sitting
017264	
017265	As he
017266	on
017267	
017268	the judgment seat,
017269	sent a message
017270	to him:
017271	
017272	
017273	his wife
017274	
017275	
017276	“Have nothing
017277	
017278	
017279	
017280	innocent
017281	to do with that
017282	greatly
017283	
017284	man; I have suffered
017285	today.”
017286	as a result of
017287	a dream
017288	about him
017289	
017290	
017291	But
017292	the chief priests
017293	and
017294	
017295	the elders
017296	persuaded
017297	
017298	the crowds
017299	to
017300	ask for
017301	
017302	Barabbas
017303	
017304	and
017305	to have Jesus
017306	killed.
017307	asked them,
017308	
017309	
017310	The governor
017311	
017312	
017313	“Which
017314	do you want
017315	of
017316	
017317	the two
017318	me to release for you?”
017319	
017320	
017321	And
017322	they said,
017323	
017324	“Barabbas!”
017325	said to them,
017326	
017327	
017328	Pilate
017329	what
017330	“Then
017331	should I do
017332	with Jesus
017333	
017334	who is called
017335	the Christ?”
017336	said,
017337	They all
017338	“Crucify him!”
017339	
017340	
017341	He asked,
017342	“Why? What
017343	
017344	wrong
017345	has he done?”
017346	
017347	But
017348	more insistently,
017349	they shouted
017350	
017351	“Crucify him!”
017352	saw
017353	
017354	
017355	When Pilate
017356	
017357	nothing,
017358	that he could do
017359	but
017360	that instead
017361	a riot
017362	was starting,
017363	he took
017364	some water,
017365	washed
017366	
017367	his hands
017368	before
017369	
017370	the crowd
017371	and said,
017372	innocent
017373	“I am
017374	of
017375	
017376	this man’s blood.
017377	
017378	
017379	You take care of it yourselves!”
017380	
017381	In reply
017382	all
017383	
017384	the people
017385	said,
017386	
017387	“Let his blood
017388	
017389	be on us
017390	
017391	
017392	and on
017393	
017394	our children!”
017395	
017396	Then
017397	he released
017398	
017399	
017400	Barabbas for them.
017401	
017402	But
017403	after he had Jesus
017404	flogged,
017405	he handed him over
017406	to
017407	be crucified.
017408	Then
017409	
017410	soldiers
017411	
017412	the governor’s
017413	took
017414	
017415	Jesus
017416	into
017417	
017418	the governor’s residence
017419	and gathered
017420	around him.
017421	
017422	the whole
017423	
017424	cohort
017425	
017426	They stripped him
017427	
017428	robe around him,
017429	a scarlet
017430	and put
017431	
017432	
017433	and after braiding
017434	a crown
017435	of
017436	thorns,
017437	they put
017438	it on
017439	
017440	his head.
017441	
017442	
017443	They put a staff
017444	in
017445	
017446	his right hand,
017447	
017448	
017449	and kneeling down
017450	before him,
017451	
017452	they mocked him:
017453	
017454	
017455	“Hail,
017456	king
017457	of the
017458	Jews!”
017459	
017460	They spat
017461	on him
017462	
017463	and took
017464	
017465	the staff
017466	
017467	and struck
017468	him repeatedly on
017469	
017470	the head.
017471	
017472	
017473	When
017474	they had mocked him,
017475	
017476	they stripped him
017477	
017478	
017479	of the robe
017480	
017481	and put
017482	
017483	
017484	his own clothes back on
017485	him.
017486	
017487	Then they led him
017488	
017489	away
017490	
017491	to crucify him.
017492	As they were going out,
017493	
017494	they found
017495	a man
017496	from Cyrene
017497	named
017498	Simon,
017499	
017500	whom they forced
017501	to
017502	carry
017503	
017504	his cross.
017505	
017506	
017507	They came
017508	to
017509	a place
017510	called
017511	Golgotha
017512	(which
017513	means
017514	of the Skull”)
017515	“Place
017516	
017517	and offered
017518	
017519	to drink.
017520	Jesus wine
017521	with
017522	gall
017523	mixed
017524	
017525	But after tasting
017526	not
017527	it, he would
017528	drink it.
017529	When they had crucified him,
017530	
017531	
017532	they divided
017533	
017534	his clothes
017535	
017536	by throwing
017537	dice.
017538	
017539	Then they sat down
017540	and kept guard over him
017541	
017542	there.
017543	
017544	they put
017545	Above
017546	
017547	his head
017548	
017549	
017550	the charge against him,
017551	
017552	which read:
017553	
017554	“This is
017555	Jesus,
017556	
017557	the king
017558	
017559	of the Jews.”
017560	Then
017561	were crucified
017562	with him,
017563	
017564	two
017565	outlaws
017566	one
017567	on
017568	his right
017569	
017570	and one
017571	on
017572	his left.
017573	
017574	
017575	Those who passed by
017576	defamed him,
017577	
017578	shaking
017579	
017580	their heads
017581	
017582	
017583	and saying,
017584	
017585	“You who can destroy
017586	
017587	the temple
017588	
017589	it in
017590	three
017591	days,
017592	and rebuild
017593	save
017594	yourself!
017595	If
017596	Son,
017597	you are
017598	
017599	God’s
017600	
017601	come down
017602	from
017603	
017604	the cross!”
017605	In the same way
017606	
017607	
017608	even the chief priests –
017609	were mocking him:
017610	together with
017611	
017612	the experts in the law
017613	
017614	and elders –
017615	
017616	others,
017617	“He saved
017618	himself!
017619	
017620	but he cannot
017621	save
017622	the king
017623	of Israel!
017624	He is
017625	If he comes down
017626	now
017627	from
017628	
017629	the cross,
017630	
017631	we will believe
017632	in him!
017633	
017634	He trusts
017635	in
017636	
017637	God –
017638	to, deliver him
017639	now
017640	let God, if
017641	he wants
017642	
017643	he said,
017644	because
017645	
017646	God’s
017647	‘I am
017648	Son’!”
017649	
017650	
017651	
017652	
017653	
017654	The robbers
017655	
017656	who were crucified
017657	with him
017658	
017659	also spoke abusively to him.
017660	
017661	from
017662	Now
017663	noon
017664	
017665	darkness
017666	came
017667	over
017668	all
017669	
017670	the land.
017671	until
017672	
017673	three,
017674	At about
017675	
017676	
017677	three
017678	o’clock
017679	shouted
017680	
017681	Jesus
017682	voice,
017683	with a loud
017684	
017685	“Eli,
017686	Eli,
017687	lema
017688	sabachthani?”
017689	
017690	that is,
017691	“My God,
017692	
017693	my God,
017694	
017695	why
017696	
017697	have you forsaken me?”
017698	When some
017699	
017700	
017701	
017702	of the bystanders
017703	heard
017704	it, they said,
017705	
017706	for Elijah.”
017707	“This man is calling
017708	
017709	
017710	Immediately
017711	ran
017712	one
017713	of them
017714	
017715	
017716	and got
017717	a sponge,
017718	filled
017719	
017720	it with sour wine,
017721	
017722	put it on
017723	a stick,
017724	and gave it to
017725	him to drink.
017726	
017727	But
017728	the rest
017729	said,
017730	“Leave him alone!
017731	Let’s see
017732	if
017733	will come
017734	Elijah
017735	to save him.”
017736	
017737	
017738	Then
017739	Jesus
017740	again
017741	cried out
017742	voice
017743	with a loud
017744	and gave up
017745	
017746	his spirit.
017747	
017748	Just then
017749	
017750	curtain
017751	
017752	the temple
017753	was torn
017754	from
017755	top
017756	to
017757	bottom.
017758	in
017759	two,
017760	
017761	
017762	The earth
017763	shook
017764	
017765	
017766	and the rocks
017767	were split apart.
017768	
017769	
017770	And tombs
017771	were opened,
017772	
017773	of many
017774	and the bodies
017775	
017776	who had died
017777	saints
017778	were raised.
017779	
017780	(They came out
017781	of
017782	
017783	the tombs
017784	after
017785	
017786	his resurrection
017787	
017788	and went
017789	into
017790	
017791	the holy
017792	city
017793	
017794	and appeared
017795	to many people.)
017796	
017797	Now
017798	when the centurion
017799	
017800	
017801	and those with him
017802	
017803	guarding
017804	
017805	Jesus
017806	saw
017807	
017808	the earthquake
017809	
017810	
017811	and what took place,
017812	who were
017813	they were extremely terrified
017814	and said,
017815	“Truly
017816	God’s
017817	Son!”
017818	this one was
017819	
017820	were
017821	also
017822	there,
017823	women
017824	Many
017825	from
017826	a distance.
017827	watching
017828	
017829	who had followed
017830	
017831	Jesus
017832	from
017833	
017834	Galilee and given him
017835	support
017836	
017837	Among
017838	them
017839	were
017840	Mary
017841	
017842	Magdalene,
017843	
017844	Mary
017845	
017846	
017847	of James
017848	
017849	and Joseph,
017850	the mother
017851	
017852	
017853	and the mother
017854	
017855	of the sons
017856	of Zebedee.
017857	evening,
017858	Now
017859	when it was
017860	there came
017861	man
017862	a rich
017863	from
017864	Arimathea,
017865	named
017866	Joseph,
017867	who
017868	
017869	
017870	was also a disciple
017871	
017872	of Jesus.
017873	
017874	He went
017875	
017876	to Pilate
017877	and asked for
017878	
017879	the body
017880	
017881	of Jesus.
017882	Then
017883	
017884	Pilate
017885	ordered
017886	that it be given to him.
017887	
017888	took
017889	
017890	the body,
017891	
017892	Joseph
017893	wrapped it
017894	
017895	in
017896	linen cloth,
017897	a clean
017898	
017899	and placed
017900	
017901	it in
017902	
017903	his own new
017904	
017905	tomb
017906	that
017907	he had cut
017908	in
017909	
017910	the rock.
017911	
017912	Then he rolled
017913	stone
017914	a great
017915	
017916	across the entrance
017917	
017918	of the tomb
017919	and went away.
017920	
017921	(Now
017922	there,
017923	Mary
017924	
017925	Magdalene
017926	
017927	
017928	and the other
017929	Mary
017930	were sitting
017931	opposite
017932	
017933	the tomb.)
017934	
017935	
017936	The next day
017937	(which
017938	is
017939	after
017940	
017941	the day of preparation)
017942	assembled
017943	
017944	the chief priests
017945	
017946	
017947	and the Pharisees
017948	before
017949	Pilate
017950	and said,
017951	“Sir,
017952	we remember that
017953	
017954	while that
017955	
017956	deceiver
017957	he said,
017958	was still
017959	alive
017960	‘After
017961	three
017962	days
017963	I will rise again.’
017964	give orders
017965	So
017966	to secure
017967	
017968	the tomb
017969	until
017970	
017971	the third
017972	day.
017973	Otherwise
017974	may come
017975	
017976	his disciples
017977	
017978	and steal
017979	
017980	
017981	his body and say
017982	
017983	to the people,
017984	‘He has been raised
017985	from
017986	
017987	the dead,’
017988	
017989	will be
017990	
017991	and the last
017992	deception
017993	worse
017994	
017995	than the first.”
017996	said to them,
017997	
017998	
017999	Pilate
018000	“Take
018001	a guard of soldiers.
018002	Go
018003	and make it as secure
018004	as
018005	you can.”
018006	
018007	So
018008	they went
018009	secure
018010	
018011	and made the tomb
018012	by sealing
018013	
018014	the stone.
018015	with
018016	
018017	the soldiers of the guard
018018	after
018019	Now
018020	the Sabbath,
018021	
018022	at dawn
018023	on
018024	the first
018025	day of the week,
018026	went
018027	Mary
018028	
018029	Magdalene
018030	
018031	
018032	and the other
018033	Mary
018034	to look at
018035	
018036	the tomb.
018037	
018038	Suddenly
018039	earthquake,
018040	there was
018041	a severe
018042	an angel
018043	for
018044	of the Lord
018045	descending
018046	from
018047	heaven
018048	
018049	came
018050	and rolled away
018051	
018052	the stone
018053	
018054	and sat
018055	on it.
018056	
018057	was
018058	
018059	
018060	His appearance
018061	
018062	like
018063	lightning,
018064	
018065	
018066	and his clothes
018067	
018068	were white
018069	as
018070	snow.
018071	
018072	
018073	
018074	because they were so afraid of him.
018075	
018076	were shaken
018077	
018078	The guards
018079	
018080	and became
018081	like
018082	dead men
018083	
018084	But
018085	
018086	the angel
018087	said
018088	
018089	to the women,
018090	“Do not
018091	be afraid;
018092	
018093	I know
018094	
018095	
018096	Jesus,
018097	
018098	who was crucified.
018099	that you are looking for
018100	not
018101	He is
018102	here,
018103	he has been raised,
018104	for
018105	just as
018106	he said.
018107	Come
018108	and see
018109	
018110	the place
018111	where
018112	he was lying.
018113	
018114	quickly
018115	Then go
018116	and tell
018117	
018118	his disciples,
018119	
018120	
018121	‘He has been raised
018122	from
018123	
018124	the dead.
018125	
018126	Listen,
018127	He is going ahead of you
018128	
018129	into
018130	
018131	Galilee.
018132	there.’
018133	
018134	You will see him
018135	
018136	I have told you!”
018137	
018138	
018139	So they left
018140	quickly,
018141	
018142	
018143	the tomb
018144	with
018145	fear
018146	
018147	joy,
018148	and great
018149	and ran
018150	to tell
018151	
018152	his disciples.
018153	
018154	
018155	
018156	But Jesus
018157	met them,
018158	
018159	saying,
018160	“Greetings!”
018161	
018162	
018163	They came to him,
018164	held on
018165	
018166	
018167	to his feet
018168	
018169	and worshiped him.
018170	
018171	Then
018172	said to them,
018173	
018174	
018175	Jesus
018176	“Do not
018177	be afraid.
018178	Go
018179	and tell
018180	
018181	my brothers
018182	
018183	to
018184	go
018185	to
018186	
018187	Galilee.
018188	there.”
018189	
018190	They will see me
018191	While they were going,
018192	
018193	
018194	
018195	some
018196	
018197	of the guard
018198	went
018199	into
018200	
018201	the city
018202	and told
018203	
018204	the chief priests
018205	everything
018206	
018207	that had happened.
018208	
018209	After they had assembled
018210	with
018211	
018212	the elders
018213	a plan,
018214	
018215	and formed
018216	of money
018217	a large sum
018218	they gave
018219	
018220	to the soldiers,
018221	telling
018222	them, “You are to say,
018223	
018224	
018225	‘His disciples
018226	
018227	at night
018228	came
018229	and stole
018230	
018231	
018232	his body while we were asleep.’
018233	
018234	If
018235	this matter is heard
018236	
018237	before
018238	
018239	the governor,
018240	
018241	we will satisfy
018242	
018243	
018244	
018245	out of trouble.”
018246	him and keep you
018247	
018248	So
018249	they took
018250	
018251	the money
018252	and did
018253	as
018254	they were instructed.
018255	
018256	is told among
018257	
018258	And this story
018259	
018260	
018261	the Jews
018262	to
018263	
018264	this
018265	day.
018266	
018267	So
018268	the eleven
018269	disciples
018270	went
018271	to
018272	
018273	Galilee
018274	to
018275	
018276	the mountain
018277	
018278	had designated.
018279	
018280	
018281	Jesus
018282	
018283	When they saw him,
018284	
018285	they worshiped him,
018286	
018287	but
018288	some doubted.
018289	
018290	came up
018291	
018292	Then Jesus
018293	and said to them,
018294	
018295	
018296	has been given to me.
018297	
018298	“All
018299	authority
018300	in
018301	heaven
018302	
018303	and on
018304	
018305	earth
018306	go
018307	Therefore
018308	and make disciples
018309	of all
018310	
018311	nations,
018312	baptizing them
018313	
018314	in
018315	
018316	the name
018317	
018318	of the Father
018319	
018320	
018321	and the Son
018322	
018323	
018324	and the Holy
018325	Spirit,
018326	teaching them
018327	
018328	to obey
018329	everything
018330	
018331	I have commanded you.
018332	
018333	
018334	And remember,
018335	
018336	with you
018337	
018338	I am
018339	
018340	
018341	always,
018342	to
018343	
018344	the end
018345	
018346	of the age.”
018347	The beginning
018348	
018349	of the gospel
018350	of Jesus
018351	Christ,
018352	the Son
018353	of God.
018354	As
018355	it is written
018356	in
018357	
018358	Isaiah,
018359	
018360	the prophet
018361	“Look,
018362	I am sending
018363	
018364	my messenger
018365	
018366	ahead of
018367	
018368	
018369	you, who
018370	will prepare
018371	
018372	your way,
018373	
018374	the voice
018375	of one shouting
018376	in
018377	
018378	the wilderness,
018379	‘Prepare
018380	
018381	the way
018382	for the Lord,
018383	straight.’”
018384	make
018385	
018386	his paths

018389	John
018390	
018391	the baptizer
018392	In
018393	
018394	the wilderness
018395	
018396	began preaching
018397	a baptism
018398	of repentance
018399	for
018400	the forgiveness
018401	of sins.
018402	
018403	were going out
018404	to him,
018405	
018406	People from the whole
018407	
018408	Judean
018409	countryside
018410	
018411	
018412	of Jerusalem
018413	and all
018414	
018415	and he was baptizing
018416	
018417	
018418	them in
018419	
018420	the Jordan
018421	River
018422	as they confessed
018423	
018424	their sins.
018425	
018426	
018427	
018428	
018429	John
018430	wore a garment
018431	hair
018432	made of camel’s
018433	
018434	belt
018435	with a leather
018436	around
018437	
018438	his waist,
018439	
018440	
018441	and he ate
018442	locusts
018443	
018444	honey.
018445	and wild
018446	
018447	He proclaimed,
018448	
018449	is coming
018450	
018451	“One more powerful
018452	than I am
018453	after me;
018454	
018455	
018456	not
018457	I am
018458	worthy
018459	to bend down
018460	and untie
018461	
018462	the strap
018463	
018464	of his sandals.
018465	
018466	
018467	I baptize you
018468	
018469	with water,
018470	
018471	but
018472	he will baptize you
018473	
018474	
018475	Spirit.”
018476	with the Holy
018477	
018478	
018479	Now in
018480	those
018481	
018482	days
018483	came
018484	Jesus
018485	from
018486	Nazareth
018487	
018488	in Galilee
018489	
018490	and was baptized
018491	in
018492	the
018493	Jordan River.
018494	by
018495	John
018496	
018497	And just as
018498	Jesus was coming up
018499	out of
018500	
018501	the water,
018502	he saw
018503	splitting apart
018504	
018505	the heavens
018506	
018507	
018508	and the Spirit
018509	like
018510	a dove.
018511	descending
018512	on him
018513	
018514	
018515	And a voice
018516	came
018517	from
018518	
018519	heaven:
018520	
018521	“You are
018522	
018523	Son;
018524	
018525	
018526	my one dear
018527	in
018528	
018529	you I take great delight.”
018530	
018531	immediately
018532	
018533	The Spirit
018534	
018535	drove him
018536	into
018537	
018538	the wilderness.
018539	
018540	He was
018541	in
018542	
018543	the wilderness
018544	forty
018545	days,
018546	enduring temptations
018547	from
018548	
018549	Satan.
018550	
018551	He was
018552	with
018553	
018554	wild animals,
018555	
018556	
018557	and angels
018558	were ministering to his needs.
018559	
018560	after
018561	Now
018562	
018563	was imprisoned,
018564	
018565	John
018566	went
018567	
018568	Jesus
018569	into
018570	
018571	Galilee
018572	and proclaimed
018573	
018574	the gospel
018575	
018576	of God.
018577	
018578	He said,
018579	
018580	is fulfilled
018581	
018582	“The time
018583	
018584	is near.
018585	
018586	and the kingdom
018587	
018588	of God
018589	Repent
018590	
018591	and believe
018592	
018593	
018594	the gospel!”
018595	
018596	As he went
018597	along
018598	
018599	the Sea
018600	
018601	of Galilee,
018602	he saw
018603	Simon
018604	
018605	and Andrew,
018606	
018607	brother,
018608	Simon’s
018609	casting a net
018610	into
018611	
018612	the sea
018613	they were
018614	(for
018615	fishermen).
018616	
018617	said to them,
018618	
018619	
018620	Jesus
018621	
018622	“Follow me,
018623	
018624	
018625	and I will turn
018626	
018627	you into
018628	fishers
018629	of people!”
018630	
018631	immediately
018632	They left
018633	
018634	their nets
018635	and followed him.
018636	
018637	
018638	Going on
018639	a little farther,
018640	he saw
018641	James,
018642	
018643	
018644	the son of Zebedee,
018645	
018646	and John
018647	
018648	his brother
018649	
018650	
018651	
018652	in
018653	
018654	their boat
018655	mending
018656	
018657	nets.
018658	
018659	Immediately
018660	he called them,
018661	
018662	
018663	and they left
018664	
018665	their father
018666	
018667	Zebedee
018668	in
018669	
018670	the boat
018671	with
018672	
018673	the hired men
018674	and followed him.
018675	
018676	
018677	
018678	Then they went
018679	to
018680	Capernaum.
018681	
018682	When
018683	
018684	the Sabbath came,
018685	Jesus went into
018686	
018687	
018688	the synagogue
018689	and began to teach.
018690	
018691	The people there were amazed
018692	by
018693	
018694	his teaching,
018695	
018696	
018697	because
018698	he taught them
018699	
018700	like
018701	authority,
018702	one who had
018703	
018704	not
018705	like
018706	
018707	the experts in the law.
018708	
018709	Just then
018710	there was
018711	in
018712	
018713	their synagogue
018714	
018715	a man
018716	with
018717	spirit,
018718	an unclean
018719	
018720	and he cried out,
018721	
018722	who
018723	
018724	
018725	
018726	“Leave us alone, Jesus
018727	the Nazarene!
018728	Have you come
018729	to destroy us?
018730	
018731	I know
018732	
018733	
018734	you are –
018735	
018736	the Holy One
018737	
018738	of God!”
018739	
018740	rebuked him:
018741	
018742	
018743	But Jesus
018744	
018745	“Silence!
018746	
018747	Come out
018748	of him!”
018749	
018750	
018751	After throwing
018752	him into convulsions,
018753	
018754	spirit
018755	
018756	the unclean
018757	
018758	cried out
018759	voice
018760	with a loud
018761	and came out
018762	of him.
018763	
018764	
018765	amazed
018766	They were all
018767	so that
018768	they asked
018769	
018770	each other,
018771	
018772	“What
018773	is this?
018774	
018775	teaching
018776	A new
018777	with
018778	authority!
018779	
018780	
018781	spirits
018782	
018783	the unclean
018784	He even commands
018785	
018786	and they obey him.”
018787	
018788	
018789	spread
018790	
018791	So the news about him
018792	
018793	quickly
018794	throughout
018795	
018796	all
018797	
018798	the region around
018799	
018800	Galilee.
018801	
018802	Now as soon as
018803	
018804	
018805	the synagogue,
018806	they left
018807	they entered
018808	
018809	
018810	house,
018811	Simon
018812	
018813	and Andrew’s
018814	with
018815	James
018816	
018817	and John.
018818	
018819	
018820	mother-in-law
018821	Simon’s
018822	was lying down,
018823	sick with a fever,
018824	
018825	at once
018826	so they spoke to Jesus
018827	
018828	about her.
018829	
018830	
018831	He came
018832	and raised
018833	her up
018834	by gently taking
018835	
018836	her hand.
018837	
018838	left her
018839	
018840	
018841	Then the fever
018842	
018843	and she began to serve them.
018844	
018845	evening,
018846	
018847	When it was
018848	after
018849	sunset,
018850	
018851	
018852	they brought
018853	to him
018854	
018855	all
018856	
018857	sick
018858	who were
018859	
018860	
018861	and demon-possessed.
018862	
018863	
018864	The whole
018865	
018866	town
018867	gathered
018868	by
018869	
018870	the door.
018871	
018872	So he healed
018873	many
018874	sick
018875	who were
018876	with various
018877	diseases
018878	
018879	demons.
018880	many
018881	and drove out
018882	
018883	But he would not
018884	permit
018885	to speak,
018886	
018887	the demons
018888	
018889	because they knew him.
018890	
018891	
018892	early in the morning
018893	dark,
018894	when it was still very
018895	Then Jesus got up
018896	departed,
018897	
018898	and went out
018899	to
018900	a deserted
018901	place,
018902	and there
018903	he spent time in prayer.
018904	
018905	searched for him.
018906	
018907	Simon
018908	
018909	
018910	and his companions
018911	
018912	
018913	When they found him,
018914	
018915	
018916	they said,
018917	
018918	
018919	“Everyone
018920	is looking for you.”
018921	
018922	
018923	He replied,
018924	
018925	“Let us go
018926	elsewhere,
018927	into
018928	
018929	
018930	the surrounding villages,
018931	so that
018932	
018933	there
018934	I can preach
018935	
018936	that is what
018937	too. For
018938	I came out here to do.”
018939	
018940	So he went
018941	preaching
018942	into
018943	
018944	their synagogues
018945	
018946	in
018947	all
018948	
018949	of Galilee
018950	
018951	
018952	demons.
018953	and casting out
018954	
018955	came
018956	to
018957	him
018958	Now a leper
018959	asking for help.
018960	
018961	
018962	and fell to his knees,
018963	
018964	he said.
018965	
018966	
018967	“If
018968	you are willing,
018969	you can
018970	me clean,”
018971	make
018972	
018973	Moved with compassion,
018974	Jesus stretched out
018975	
018976	his hand
018977	
018978	and touched
018979	
018980	him, saying,
018981	
018982	“I am willing.
018983	Be clean!”
018984	
018985	at once,
018986	left him
018987	
018988	
018989	
018990	The leprosy
018991	
018992	and he was clean.
018993	
018994	with a very strong warning.
018995	
018996	Immediately
018997	Jesus sent
018998	the man away
018999	
019000	He told him,
019001	
019002	“See
019003	that you do not
019004	anything to anyone,
019005	say
019006	but
019007	go,
019008	yourself
019009	show
019010	
019011	to a priest,
019012	
019013	and bring the offering
019014	for
019015	
019016	your cleansing,
019017	
019018	that
019019	commanded
019020	Moses
019021	as
019022	a testimony to them.”
019023	
019024	
019025	But
019026	as the man went out
019027	he began
019028	to announce
019029	it publicly
019030	
019031	and spread
019032	
019033	the story
019034	widely, so that
019035	Jesus was no longer
019036	
019037	able
019038	openly
019039	
019040	any town
019041	to enter
019042	but
019043	outside
019044	in
019045	remote
019046	places.
019047	stayed
019048	
019049	Still they kept coming
019050	to him
019051	
019052	from everywhere.
019053	
019054	when he returned
019055	
019056	to
019057	Capernaum,
019058	Now after
019059	some days,
019060	the news spread
019061	
019062	at
019063	home.
019064	that he was
019065	
019066	gathered
019067	So many
019068	that
019069	there was no longer
019070	any room,
019071	not even
019072	
019073	by
019074	
019075	the door,
019076	
019077	and he preached
019078	
019079	
019080	the word to them.
019081	
019082	Some people came
019083	bringing
019084	to him
019085	
019086	a paralytic,
019087	carried
019088	by
019089	four of them.
019090	
019091	When they were not
019092	able
019093	to bring him
019094	
019095	in because of
019096	
019097	the crowd,
019098	they removed
019099	
019100	the roof
019101	above Jesus.
019102	
019103	
019104	Then, after tearing it out,
019105	they lowered
019106	
019107	the stretcher
019108	
019109	
019110	the paralytic
019111	was lying on.
019112	
019113	saw
019114	
019115	When Jesus
019116	
019117	their faith,
019118	
019119	he said
019120	
019121	to the paralytic,
019122	“Son,
019123	are forgiven.”
019124	
019125	
019126	your sins
019127	were
019128	Now
019129	some
019130	
019131	of the experts in the law
019132	there,
019133	sitting
019134	
019135	turning these things over
019136	in
019137	
019138	their minds:
019139	
019140	“Why
019141	
019142	this way?
019143	does this man speak
019144	He is blaspheming!
019145	Who
019146	can
019147	forgive
019148	sins
019149	
019150	but
019151	alone?”
019152	
019153	God
019154	
019155	Now immediately,
019156	realized
019157	
019158	when Jesus
019159	
019160	in his spirit
019161	
019162	
019163	
019164	that they were contemplating
019165	such things in
019166	
019167	such thoughts, he said to them,
019168	
019169	“Why
019170	
019171	are you thinking
019172	
019173	
019174	your hearts?
019175	
019176	Which
019177	is
019178	easier,
019179	to say
019180	
019181	to the paralytic,
019182	are forgiven,’
019183	
019184	
019185	‘Your sins
019186	or
019187	to say,
019188	‘Stand up,
019189	
019190	take
019191	
019192	your stretcher,
019193	
019194	
019195	and walk’?
019196	so that
019197	But
019198	you may know
019199	
019200	authority
019201	has
019202	
019203	that the Son
019204	
019205	of Man
019206	to forgive
019207	sins,” –
019208	on
019209	
019210	earth
019211	he said
019212	
019213	to the paralytic –
019214	
019215	“I tell you,
019216	stand up,
019217	take
019218	
019219	your stretcher,
019220	
019221	
019222	and go
019223	
019224	
019225	home.”
019226	
019227	
019228	the man stood up,
019229	
019230	And immediately
019231	took
019232	
019233	his stretcher,
019234	and went out
019235	in front of
019236	them all.
019237	
019238	amazed
019239	They were all
019240	
019241	and glorified
019242	
019243	God,
019244	saying,
019245	
019246	anything like this!”
019247	“We have never
019248	seen
019249	
019250	Jesus went out
019251	again
019252	by
019253	
019254	the sea.
019255	
019256	The whole
019257	
019258	crowd
019259	came
019260	to him,
019261	
019262	
019263	and he taught them.
019264	
019265	
019266	As he went along,
019267	he saw
019268	Levi,
019269	the son
019270	
019271	of Alphaeus,
019272	sitting
019273	at
019274	
019275	the tax booth.
019276	
019277	he said to him.
019278	
019279	“Follow me,”
019280	
019281	
019282	And he got up
019283	and followed him.
019284	
019285	
019286	As Jesus was
019287	having a meal
019288	
019289	in
019290	
019291	Levi’s home,
019292	
019293	
019294	many
019295	tax collectors
019296	
019297	and sinners
019298	were eating
019299	
019300	with Jesus
019301	
019302	
019303	and his disciples,
019304	
019305	there were
019306	for
019307	many
019308	
019309	who followed him.
019310	
019311	
019312	
019313	When the experts in the law
019314	
019315	and the Pharisees
019316	saw
019317	
019318	that he was eating
019319	with
019320	
019321	sinners
019322	
019323	and tax collectors,
019324	they said
019325	
019326	to his disciples,
019327	
019328	
019329	with
019330	
019331	tax collectors
019332	
019333	and sinners?”
019334	“Why does he eat
019335	
019336	heard
019337	
019338	When Jesus
019339	this he said to them,
019340	
019341	
019342	don’t
019343	need
019344	those who are
019345	
019346	“Those who are healthy
019347	a physician,
019348	but
019349	
019350	sick
019351	do. I have
019352	not
019353	come
019354	to call
019355	the righteous,
019356	but
019357	sinners.”
019358	
019359	
019360	
019361	disciples
019362	Now John’s
019363	
019364	
019365	and the Pharisees
019366	were fasting.
019367	
019368	So they came
019369	
019370	to Jesus and said,
019371	
019372	
019373	“Why
019374	
019375	do the disciples
019376	of John
019377	
019378	
019379	and the disciples
019380	
019381	of the Pharisees
019382	fast,
019383	
019384	but
019385	your
019386	disciples
019387	don’t
019388	fast?”
019389	
019390	said to them,
019391	
019392	
019393	
019394	Jesus
019395	cannot
019396	
019397	guests
019398	
019399	“The wedding
019400	
019401	
019402	
019403	while the bridegroom
019404	with them,
019405	
019406	is
019407	fast
019408	can they? As long as
019409	
019410	they have
019411	
019412	the bridegroom
019413	with them
019414	
019415	not
019416	they do
019417	fast.
019418	are coming
019419	But
019420	the days
019421	when
019422	will be taken
019423	from them,
019424	
019425	
019426	the bridegroom
019427	
019428	
019429	they will fast.
019430	and at
019431	that
019432	
019433	time
019434	No one
019435	cloth
019436	a patch
019437	of unshrunk
019438	sews
019439	on
019440	garment;
019441	an old
019442	
019443	
019444	otherwise,
019445	pulls away
019446	
019447	the patch
019448	from it,
019449	
019450	
019451	the new
019452	
019453	from the old,
019454	
019455	worse.
019456	and the tear
019457	becomes
019458	
019459	And no one
019460	pours
019461	wine
019462	new
019463	into
019464	wineskins;
019465	old
019466	
019467	
019468	otherwise,
019469	will burst
019470	
019471	the wine
019472	
019473	the skins,
019474	
019475	
019476	and both the wine
019477	will be destroyed.
019478	
019479	
019480	and the skins
019481	Instead
019482	wine
019483	new
019484	is poured into
019485	wineskins.”
019486	new
019487	
019488	
019489	
019490	on
019491	
019492	a Sabbath,
019493	Jesus was going
019494	through
019495	
019496	the grain fields
019497	
019498	
019499	and his disciples
019500	
019501	began
019502	their way.
019503	as they made
019504	to pick
019505	
019506	some heads of wheat
019507	
019508	
019509	So the Pharisees
019510	said to him,
019511	
019512	“Look,
019513	why
019514	are they doing
019515	
019516	on the Sabbath?”
019517	what
019518	is against
019519	the law
019520	
019521	He said to them,
019522	
019523	“Have you never
019524	read
019525	what
019526	did
019527	David
019528	when
019529	in need
019530	he was
019531	
019532	were hungry –
019533	
019534	
019535	
019536	and he and his companions
019537	
019538	how
019539	he entered
019540	
019541	
019542	the house
019543	
019544	of God
019545	when
019546	Abiathar
019547	was high priest
019548	
019549	
019550	bread,
019551	
019552	the sacred
019553	and ate
019554	which
019555	is against
019556	the law
019557	to eat,
019558	
019559	for any but
019560	
019561	the priests
019562	
019563	and also gave
019564	
019565	
019566	it to his companions?”
019567	
019568	
019569	
019570	Then he said to them,
019571	
019572	
019573	“The Sabbath
019574	for
019575	
019576	people,
019577	was made
019578	
019579	not
019580	
019581	people
019582	for
019583	
019584	the Sabbath.
019585	For this reason
019586	lord
019587	is
019588	
019589	the Son
019590	
019591	of Man
019592	
019593	
019594	even of the Sabbath.”
019595	
019596	Then Jesus entered
019597	again,
019598	
019599	
019600	the synagogue
019601	
019602	was
019603	there
019604	and a man
019605	a withered
019606	who had
019607	
019608	hand.
019609	
019610	They watched
019611	
019612	Jesus closely to see if
019613	
019614	on the Sabbath,
019615	he would heal him
019616	
019617	so that
019618	they could accuse him.
019619	
019620	
019621	So he said
019622	
019623	to the man
019624	
019625	
019626	hand,
019627	who had
019628	the withered
019629	“Stand up
019630	
019631	
019632	among all these people.”
019633	
019634	Then he said to them,
019635	
019636	“Is it lawful
019637	
019638	on the Sabbath,
019639	good
019640	to do
019641	or
019642	evil,
019643	a life
019644	to save
019645	or
019646	destroy
019647	
019648	it?” But
019649	they were silent.
019650	
019651	After looking around at them
019652	
019653	in
019654	anger,
019655	grieved
019656	by
019657	
019658	the hardness
019659	
019660	of their hearts,
019661	
019662	he said
019663	
019664	to the man,
019665	“Stretch out
019666	
019667	your hand.”
019668	
019669	He stretched it out,
019670	
019671	was restored.
019672	
019673	and his hand
019674	
019675	
019676	went out
019677	
019678	So the Pharisees
019679	immediately
019680	with
019681	
019682	the Herodians,
019683	and began plotting
019684	
019685	
019686	
019687	as to how
019688	
019689	they could assassinate him.
019690	
019691	
019692	Then Jesus
019693	with
019694	
019695	his disciples
019696	
019697	went away
019698	to
019699	
019700	the sea,
019701	
019702	and a great
019703	multitude
019704	from
019705	
019706	Galilee
019707	followed him.
019708	
019709	And from
019710	
019711	Judea,
019712	
019713	
019714	Jerusalem,
019715	
019716	
019717	
019718	Idumea,
019719	
019720	beyond
019721	
019722	the Jordan River,
019723	
019724	and around
019725	Tyre
019726	
019727	and Sidon
019728	multitude
019729	a great
019730	when they heard
019731	about the things
019732	he had done.
019733	came
019734	to him
019735	
019736	
019737	he told
019738	
019739	his disciples
019740	
019741	to have
019742	a small boat
019743	ready for him
019744	
019745	Because of
019746	
019747	the crowd,
019748	so
019749	the crowd would not
019750	press toward him.
019751	
019752	many,
019753	For
019754	he had healed
019755	so that
019756	pressed toward him
019757	
019758	in order to
019759	
019760	touch him.
019761	all
019762	who were afflicted
019763	with diseases
019764	
019765	
019766	spirits
019767	
019768	the unclean
019769	And whenever
019770	
019771	saw him,
019772	they fell down before him
019773	
019774	
019775	and cried out,
019776	
019777	
019778	
019779	“You are
019780	
019781	the Son
019782	
019783	of God.”
019784	
019785	But he sternly
019786	ordered them
019787	
019788	to
019789	not
019790	
019791	known.
019792	make him
019793	
019794	Now Jesus went up
019795	
019796	
019797	the mountain
019798	
019799	and called for
019800	those
019801	he wanted,
019802	
019803	
019804	and they came
019805	to him.
019806	
019807	
019808	He appointed
019809	twelve
019810	(whom
019811	
019812	apostles),
019813	he named
019814	so that
019815	they would be
019816	with him
019817	
019818	
019819	
019820	and he could send them
019821	
019822	to preach
019823	
019824	and to have
019825	authority
019826	to cast out
019827	
019828	demons.
019829	
019830	He appointed
019831	
019832	twelve:
019833	
019834	he gave
019835	the name
019836	
019837	To Simon
019838	Peter;
019839	
019840	to James
019841	
019842	
019843	the sons of Zebedee,
019844	
019845	John,
019846	
019847	brother
019848	
019849	and his
019850	
019851	he gave
019852	
019853	the name
019854	Boanerges
019855	(that
019856	is,
019857	“sons
019858	of thunder”);
019859	
019860	and Andrew,
019861	
019862	Philip,
019863	
019864	Bartholomew,
019865	
019866	Matthew,
019867	
019868	Thomas,
019869	
019870	James
019871	
019872	
019873	the son of Alphaeus,
019874	
019875	Thaddaeus,
019876	
019877	Simon
019878	
019879	the Zealot,
019880	
019881	and Judas
019882	Iscariot,
019883	who
019884	
019885	betrayed him.
019886	
019887	
019888	Now Jesus went

019890	home,
019891	
019892	gathered
019893	
019894	
019895	and a crowd
019896	so that
019897	they were not
019898	able
019899	
019900	
019901	
019902	to eat.
019903	
019904	heard
019905	
019906	When his family

019908	this they went out
019909	to restrain him,
019910	
019911	they said,
019912	for

019914	“He is out of his mind.”
019915	
019916	
019917	The experts in the law
019918	
019919	from
019920	Jerusalem
019921	who came down

020070	
020071	to summon him.

020180	
020181	said to them:

020183	and in

020185	his teaching
020186	
020187	“Listen!

020189	went out
020190	
020191	A sower
020192	to sow.
020193	
020194	
020195	
020196	
020197	And as he sowed,
020198	some
020199	
020200	seed fell
020201	along
020202	
020203	the path,
020204	
020205	came
020206	
020207	and the birds
020208	
020209	and devoured it.
020210	
020211	
020212	Other
020213	seed fell
020214	on
020215	
020216	rocky ground
020217	where
020218	it did not

020232	When
020233	came up
020234	
020235	the sun
020236	it was scorched,
020237	
020238	and because
020239	
020240	it did not
020241	have
020242	sufficient root,
020243	it withered.
020244	
020245	Other
020246	seed fell
020247	among
020248	
020249	the thorns,
020250	
020251	and they grew up

020254	
020255	and choked it,

020257	
020258	grain.
020259	and it did not

020265	
020266	soil
020267	
020268	good

020273	
020274	and growing;
020275	
020276	yielded
020277	some

020280	as much, some

020282	
020283	and some
020284	a hundred times.”
020285	
020286	And he said,
020287	“Whoever

020292	
020293	When
020294	he was
020295	
020296	alone,
020297	asked him
020298	
020299	
020300	those around him
020301	
020302	with
020303	
020304	the twelve
020305	
020306	about the parables.
020307	
020308	He said to them,
020309	
020310	
020311	
020312	“The secret

020325	everything

020327	so that
020328	although they look
020329	they may look
020330	
020331	but not
020332	see,
020333	
020334	and although they hear
020335	they may hear
020336	
020337	but not
020338	understand,
020339	so they may not

020341	
020342	and be forgiven.”
020343	
020344	
020345	He said to them,

020347	“Don’t
020348	you understand

020377	immediately
020378	comes
020379	
020380	Satan
020381	
020382	and snatches
020383	
020384	the word

020401	the word,
020402	soon as
020403	with

020405	they receive it

020605	the full
020606	grain
020607	in
020608	
020609	the head.
020610	when
020611	And
020612	is ripe,
020613	
020614	the grain
020615	
020616	he sends
020617	
020618	in the sickle
020619	
020620	has come.”
020621	
020622	because the harvest
020623	
020624	He also asked,
020625	“To what
020626	can we compare
020627	
020628	the kingdom
020629	
020630	of God,
020631	or
020632	
020633	what
020634	
020635	parable
020636	can we use to present it?
020637	It is like
020638	seed
020639	a mustard
020640	that
020641	when
020642	sown
020643	in
020644	
020645	the ground,
020646	even though it is the smallest
020647	
020648	of all
020649	
020650	the seeds
020651	
020652	in
020653	
020654	the ground –
020655	
020656	when
020657	it is sown,
020658	it grows up,
020659	
020660	becomes
020661	the greatest
020662	of all
020663	
020664	garden plants,
020665	
020666	and grows
020667	branches
020668	large
020669	so that
020670	can
020671	in
020672	
020673	its shade.”
020674	
020675	
020676	birds
020677	
020678	the wild
020679	nest
020680	
020681	like these,
020682	parables
020683	So with many
020684	he spoke
020685	
020686	
020687	the word to them,
020688	as
020689	they were able
020690	to hear.
020691	without
020692	
020693	a parable.
020694	He did not
020695	speak to them
020696	
020697	
020698	privately
020699	But
020700	
020701	to his own
020702	disciples.
020703	he explained
020704	everything
020705	
020706	Jesus said
020707	
020708	On
020709	that
020710	
020711	day,
020712	when evening
020713	came,
020714	to his disciples, “Let’s go across
020715	to
020716	
020717	the other side of the lake.”
020718	
020719	So after leaving
020720	
020721	the crowd,
020722	they took him
020723	
020724	along, just as
020725	he was,
020726	in
020727	
020728	the boat,
020729	
020730	and other
020731	boats
020732	were
020733	with him.
020734	
020735	
020736	developed
020737	windstorm
020738	Now a great
020739	
020740	
020741	
020742	and the waves
020743	were breaking
020744	into
020745	
020746	the boat,
020747	so that
020748	was nearly
020749	swamped.
020750	
020751	the boat
020752	
020753	
020754	But he was
020755	in
020756	
020757	the stern,
020758	on
020759	
020760	a cushion.
020761	sleeping
020762	
020763	They woke
020764	him up
020765	
020766	and said to him,
020767	
020768	“Teacher,
020769	don’t
020770	you care
020771	
020772	
020773	that we are about to die?”
020774	
020775	So he got up
020776	and rebuked
020777	
020778	the wind,
020779	
020780	and said
020781	
020782	to the sea,
020783	“Be quiet!
020784	Calm down!”
020785	
020786	stopped,
020787	
020788	Then the wind
020789	
020790	and it was
020791	calm.
020792	dead
020793	
020794	And he said to them,
020795	
020796	“Why
020797	are you cowardly?
020798	
020799	Do you still not
020800	have
020801	faith?”
020802	
020803	They were overwhelmed by
020804	fear
020805	
020806	
020807	and said
020808	to
020809	one another,
020810	“Who
020811	then
020812	
020813	is this?
020814	
020815	
020816	
020817	Even the wind
020818	
020819	
020820	and sea
020821	obey him!”
020822	
020823	
020824	So they came
020825	to
020826	
020827	the other side
020828	
020829	of the lake,
020830	to
020831	
020832	the region
020833	
020834	of the Gerasenes.
020835	Just as
020836	was getting out
020837	Jesus
020838	of
020839	
020840	the boat,
020841	and
020842	met him.
020843	
020844	came from
020845	
020846	the tombs
020847	a man
020848	with
020849	spirit
020850	an unclean
020851	He
020852	
020853	
020854	lived
020855	among
020856	
020857	the tombs,
020858	
020859	not even
020860	with a chain.
020861	anymore,
020862	and no one
020863	could
020864	
020865	bind him
020866	For
020867	
020868	
020869	his hands and feet had often
020870	and shackles,
020871	
020872	with chains
020873	been bound
020874	
020875	but he had torn
020876	
020877	
020878	
020879	the chains
020880	
020881	
020882	the shackles
020883	apart and broken in pieces.
020884	
020885	No one
020886	was strong enough
020887	
020888	to subdue him.
020889	
020890	Each
020891	and every
020892	night
020893	
020894	day
020895	among
020896	
020897	the tombs
020898	
020899	and in
020900	
020901	the mountains,
020902	he would
020903	cry out
020904	
020905	and cut
020906	himself
020907	with stones.
020908	
020909	When he saw
020910	
020911	Jesus
020912	from
020913	a distance,
020914	he ran
020915	
020916	and bowed down before him.
020917	
020918	
020919	Then he cried out
020920	voice, “Leave me
020921	with a loud
020922	
020923	
020924	
020925	
020926	
020927	alone, Jesus,
020928	Son
020929	
020930	God!
020931	
020932	of the Most High
020933	I implore you
020934	
020935	
020936	by God –
020937	do not
020938	
020939	torment me!”
020940	Jesus had said to him,
020941	(For
020942	
020943	“Come out
020944	
020945	spirit!”)
020946	
020947	you unclean
020948	of
020949	
020950	that man,
020951	
020952	Jesus asked him,
020953	
020954	“What
020955	is your name?”
020956	
020957	
020958	And he said,
020959	
020960	is Legion,
020961	“My name
020962	
020963	
020964	many.”
020965	for we are
020966	
020967	He begged
020968	
020969	Jesus repeatedly
020970	to
020971	not
020972	
020973	send them
020974	out
020975	
020976	of the region.
020977	was
020978	
020979	There
020980	on
020981	
020982	the hillside,
020983	herd
020984	of pigs
020985	a great
020986	feeding.
020987	
020988	And the demonic spirits begged him,
020989	
020990	
020991	“Send us
020992	
020993	into
020994	
020995	the pigs.
020996	
020997	
020998	
020999	Let us enter them.”
021000	
021001	Jesus gave them permission.
021002	
021003	
021004	came out
021005	
021006	spirits
021007	
021008	So the unclean
021009	and went
021010	into
021011	
021012	the pigs.
021013	
021014	
021015	
021016	Then the herd
021017	rushed down
021018	
021019	the steep slope
021020	into
021021	
021022	the lake,
021023	and about
021024	two thousand
021025	
021026	were drowned
021027	in
021028	
021029	the lake.
021030	
021031	
021032	Now the herdsmen
021033	
021034	ran off
021035	
021036	and spread the news
021037	in
021038	
021039	the town
021040	
021041	
021042	
021043	and countryside,
021044	
021045	and the people went out
021046	to see
021047	what
021048	
021049	
021050	had happened.
021051	
021052	They came
021053	to
021054	
021055	Jesus
021056	
021057	and saw
021058	
021059	the demon-possessed man
021060	sitting
021061	there, clothed
021062	
021063	and in his right mind –
021064	
021065	the one who had
021066	
021067	the “Legion” –
021068	
021069	and they were afraid.
021070	
021071	reported it,
021072	
021073	
021074	Those who had seen
021075	what
021076	had happened
021077	
021078	to the demon-possessed man
021079	
021080	and they also told about
021081	
021082	the pigs.
021083	
021084	Then they began
021085	to beg
021086	
021087	Jesus to leave
021088	
021089	
021090	their region.
021091	
021092	
021093	As he was getting
021094	
021095	into
021096	
021097	the boat
021098	asked
021099	
021100	
021101	the man who had been demon-possessed
021102	if
021103	with him.
021104	
021105	he could go
021106	
021107	But Jesus did not
021108	permit him
021109	
021110	to do so. Instead,
021111	he said to him,
021112	
021113	“Go
021114	
021115	
021116	to your home
021117	
021118	and to
021119	
021120	your
021121	
021122	people and tell them
021123	
021124	what
021125	
021126	the Lord
021127	
021128	has done for you,
021129	
021130	that he had mercy on you.”
021131	
021132	
021133	So he went away
021134	
021135	and began
021136	to proclaim
021137	in
021138	
021139	the Decapolis
021140	what
021141	had done for him,
021142	
021143	
021144	Jesus
021145	
021146	and all
021147	were amazed.
021148	
021149	had crossed
021150	
021151	When Jesus
021152	in
021153	
021154	a boat
021155	again
021156	to
021157	
021158	the other side,
021159	gathered
021160	crowd
021161	a large
021162	around him,
021163	
021164	
021165	and he was
021166	by
021167	
021168	the sea.
021169	
021170	came up,
021171	Then one
021172	
021173	of the synagogue leaders,
021174	named
021175	Jairus,
021176	
021177	and when he saw
021178	
021179	Jesus, he fell
021180	at
021181	
021182	his feet.
021183	
021184	
021185	He asked him
021186	
021187	urgently,
021188	
021189	
021190	
021191	“My little daughter
021192	
021193	is near death.
021194	
021195	so that
021196	Come
021197	and lay
021198	
021199	your hands on her
021200	
021201	
021202	she may be healed
021203	
021204	and live.”
021205	
021206	Jesus went
021207	with him,
021208	
021209	
021210	followed
021211	
021212	crowd
021213	and a large
021214	
021215	and pressed around him.
021216	
021217	
021218	Now a woman
021219	was
021220	there who had been suffering from
021221	
021222	a hemorrhage
021223	for twelve
021224	years.
021225	
021226	a great deal
021227	She had endured
021228	under
021229	the care of many
021230	doctors
021231	
021232	and had spent
021233	
021234	
021235	
021236	all
021237	
021238	
021239	of getting better,
021240	that she had. Yet
021241	instead
021242	
021243	
021244	worse.
021245	she grew
021246	When she heard
021247	about
021248	
021249	Jesus,
021250	she came up
021251	him in
021252	
021253	the crowd
021254	behind
021255	and touched
021256	
021257	his cloak,
021258	
021259	she kept saying,
021260	for
021261	
021262	“If
021263	I touch
021264	only
021265	
021266	his clothes,
021267	
021268	I will be healed.”
021269	
021270	At once
021271	stopped,
021272	
021273	
021274	
021275	the bleeding
021276	
021277	
021278	and she felt
021279	
021280	in her body
021281	
021282	that she was healed
021283	of
021284	
021285	her disease.
021286	
021287	at once
021288	
021289	Jesus
021290	knew
021291	in
021292	
021293	
021294	from him.
021295	
021296	that power
021297	had gone out
021298	He turned around
021299	
021300	
021301	the crowd
021302	and said,
021303	“Who
021304	
021305	touched
021306	
021307	my clothes?”
021308	
021309	said to him,
021310	
021311	
021312	His disciples
021313	
021314	“You see
021315	
021316	the crowd
021317	pressing against
021318	
021319	
021320	you and you say,
021321	‘Who
021322	
021323	touched me?’”
021324	
021325	But he looked around
021326	to see
021327	
021328	
021329	who had done it.
021330	
021331	Then
021332	the woman,
021333	with fear
021334	
021335	and trembling,
021336	knowing
021337	what
021338	had happened to her,
021339	
021340	came
021341	
021342	and fell down before him
021343	
021344	
021345	and told him
021346	
021347	the whole
021348	
021349	truth.
021350	
021351	
021352	He said to her,
021353	
021354	“Daughter,
021355	
021356	your faith
021357	
021358	has made
021359	you well.
021360	Go
021361	in
021362	peace,
021363	
021364	and be
021365	healed
021366	of
021367	
021368	your disease.”
021369	
021370	While he was still
021371	
021372	speaking,
021373	people came
021374	from
021375	
021376	the synagogue leader’s
021377	house saying,
021378	
021379	
021380	“Your daughter
021381	
021382	has died.
021383	Why
021384	any longer?”
021385	trouble
021386	
021387	the teacher
021388	
021389	But
021390	Jesus,
021391	paying no attention
021392	
021393	to what
021394	was said,
021395	told
021396	
021397	the synagogue leader,
021398	“Do not
021399	be afraid;
021400	just
021401	believe.”
021402	
021403	He did not
021404	let
021405	anyone
021406	
021407	
021408	follow him
021409	
021410	except
021411	
021412	Peter,
021413	
021414	James,
021415	
021416	and John,
021417	
021418	the brother
021419	of James.
021420	
021421	They came
021422	to
021423	
021424	the house
021425	
021426	of the synagogue leader
021427	
021428	where he saw
021429	noisy confusion
021430	
021431	and people weeping
021432	
021433	and wailing
021434	loudly.
021435	
021436	When he entered
021437	he said to them,
021438	
021439	“Why
021440	are you distressed
021441	
021442	and weeping?
021443	
021444	The child
021445	is not
021446	dead
021447	but
021448	asleep!”
021449	
021450	And they began making fun of him.
021451	
021452	
021453	But
021454	he forced
021455	them all outside,
021456	and he took
021457	
021458	father
021459	
021460	the child’s
021461	
021462	
021463	and mother
021464	
021465	
021466	and his own companions
021467	
021468	
021469	and went into
021470	the room where
021471	was.
021472	
021473	the child
021474	
021475	Then, gently taking
021476	
021477	by the hand,
021478	
021479	the child
021480	he said to her,
021481	
021482	“Talitha
021483	koum,”
021484	which
021485	
021486	means,
021487	
021488	“Little girl,
021489	
021490	I say to you,
021491	get up.”
021492	
021493	at once
021494	got up
021495	
021496	The girl
021497	
021498	and began to walk around
021499	(she was
021500	
021501	years old).
021502	twelve
021503	
021504	astonished.
021505	
021506	at this.
021507	They were completely
021508	
021509	ordered
021510	
021511	He strictly
021512	that
021513	no one
021514	should know about this,
021515	
021516	
021517	and told them
021518	to give her
021519	
021520	something to eat.
021521	
021522	Now Jesus left
021523	that place
021524	
021525	and came
021526	to
021527	
021528	his hometown,
021529	
021530	
021531	followed him.
021532	
021533	
021534	and his disciples
021535	
021536	
021537	came,
021538	When the Sabbath
021539	he began
021540	to teach
021541	in
021542	
021543	the synagogue.
021544	
021545	Many
021546	who heard
021547	him were astonished,
021548	saying,
021549	“Where
021550	
021551	
021552	
021553	did he get these ideas? And what
021554	
021555	is this wisdom
021556	
021557	that has been given
021558	
021559	
021560	
021561	miracles
021562	to him? What are these
021563	through
021564	
021565	his hands?
021566	
021567	that are done
021568	Isn’t
021569	
021570	
021571	
021572	this the carpenter,
021573	
021574	the son
021575	
021576	of Mary
021577	
021578	and brother
021579	of James,
021580	
021581	Joses,
021582	
021583	Judas,
021584	
021585	and Simon?
021586	
021587	
021588	And aren’t
021589	
021590	his sisters
021591	
021592	here
021593	with us?”
021594	
021595	
021596	And so they took offense
021597	at him.
021598	
021599	
021600	said to them,
021601	
021602	
021603	Then Jesus
021604	
021605	not
021606	is
021607	“A prophet
021608	without honor
021609	
021610	except
021611	in
021612	
021613	his hometown,
021614	
021615	
021616	and among
021617	
021618	his relatives,
021619	
021620	
021621	and in
021622	
021623	his own house.”
021624	
021625	
021626	He was not
021627	able
021628	there,
021629	to do
021630	
021631	a miracle
021632	
021633	except
021634	on a few
021635	sick people
021636	to lay
021637	
021638	his hands
021639	and heal them.
021640	
021641	And he was amazed
021642	because of
021643	
021644	their unbelief.
021645	
021646	
021647	Then he went around
021648	
021649	the villages
021650	among
021651	and taught.
021652	
021653	Jesus called
021654	
021655	the twelve
021656	
021657	and began
021658	
021659	to send them
021660	out two
021661	by two.
021662	
021663	He gave them
021664	
021665	authority
021666	
021667	spirits.
021668	
021669	over the unclean
021670	
021671	He instructed them
021672	
021673	to
021674	nothing
021675	take
021676	for
021677	the journey
021678	
021679	except
021680	a staff –
021681	
021682	no
021683	bread,
021684	no
021685	bag,
021686	no
021687	in
021688	
021689	their belts –
021690	money
021691	and
021692	to put on
021693	sandals
021694	
021695	but not
021696	to wear
021697	two
021698	tunics.
021699	
021700	He said to them,
021701	
021702	“Wherever
021703	
021704	you enter
021705	
021706	a house,
021707	there
021708	stay
021709	until
021710	
021711	you leave
021712	the area.
021713	
021714	
021715	If
021716	a place
021717	will not
021718	welcome you
021719	
021720	or
021721	listen to you,
021722	
021723	as you go out
021724	from there,
021725	shake
021726	
021727	the dust
021728	
021729	off
021730	
021731	your feet
021732	
021733	as
021734	a testimony against them.”
021735	
021736	
021737	So they went out
021738	and preached
021739	that
021740	all should repent.
021741	
021742	demons
021743	many
021744	They cast out
021745	
021746	and anointed
021747	with olive oil
021748	many
021749	sick people
021750	
021751	and healed them.
021752	
021753	heard
021754	
021755	Now King
021756	Herod
021757	known.
021758	this, for
021759	had become
021760	
021761	Jesus’ name
021762	
021763	
021764	Some were saying,
021765	
021766	“John
021767	
021768	the baptizer
021769	has been raised
021770	from
021771	the dead,
021772	
021773	and because of this,
021774	
021775	are at work
021776	
021777	miraculous powers
021778	in him.”
021779	
021780	Others
021781	
021782	said,
021783	
021784	Elijah.”
021785	“He is
021786	Others
021787	
021788	said,
021789	
021790	“He is a prophet,
021791	like
021792	one
021793	
021794	of the prophets from the past.”
021795	heard
021796	But
021797	
021798	when Herod
021799	this, he said,
021800	whom
021801	
021802	I beheaded,
021803	“John,
021804	
021805	has been raised!”
021806	
021807	For
021808	
021809	Herod himself
021810	had sent
021811	men, arrested
021812	
021813	John,
021814	
021815	and bound him
021816	
021817	in
021818	prison
021819	on account of
021820	Herodias,
021821	
021822	wife,
021823	Philip’s
021824	
021825	his brother
021826	
021827	
021828	
021829	because Herod had married her.
021830	had repeatedly told
021831	For
021832	
021833	John
021834	
021835	Herod,
021836	
021837	“It is not
021838	lawful
021839	
021840	for you to have
021841	
021842	wife.”
021843	
021844	your brother’s
021845	
021846	
021847	So
021848	Herodias
021849	nursed a grudge against him
021850	
021851	
021852	and wanted
021853	
021854	to kill him.
021855	
021856	not
021857	But she could
021858	
021859	because
021860	Herod
021861	stood in awe
021862	
021863	of John
021864	since he knew
021865	
021866	man.
021867	that John was a righteous
021868	
021869	and holy
021870	
021871	and protected him,
021872	
021873	
021874	When Herod heard him,
021875	
021876	he was thoroughly
021877	baffled,
021878	
021879	and yet he liked
021880	
021881	to listen to John.
021882	
021883	came,
021884	day
021885	But a suitable
021886	when
021887	Herod
021888	
021889	on his birthday
021890	
021891	a banquet
021892	gave
021893	
021894	for his court officials,
021895	
021896	
021897	
021898	military commanders,
021899	
021900	
021901	and leaders
021902	
021903	of Galilee.
021904	
021905	came in
021906	
021907	When his daughter
021908	
021909	Herodias
021910	
021911	and danced,
021912	she pleased
021913	
021914	Herod
021915	
021916	
021917	and his dinner guests.
021918	said
021919	
021920	The king
021921	
021922	to the girl,
021923	“Ask me
021924	
021925	for whatever
021926	
021927	you want
021928	
021929	and I will give it to you.”
021930	
021931	
021932	He swore to her,
021933	
021934	
021935	“Whatever
021936	
021937	
021938	
021939	you ask
021940	I will give you,
021941	
021942	up to
021943	half
021944	
021945	my kingdom.”
021946	
021947	
021948	So she went out
021949	and said
021950	
021951	to her mother,
021952	
021953	“What
021954	should I ask for?”
021955	
021956	
021957	Her mother said,
021958	
021959	“The head
021960	of John
021961	
021962	the baptizer.”
021963	
021964	
021965	Immediately
021966	
021967	she hurried back
021968	to
021969	
021970	the king
021971	and made
021972	her request:
021973	“I want
021974	
021975	immediately.”
021976	
021977	
021978	on
021979	a platter
021980	
021981	the head
021982	of John
021983	
021984	the Baptist
021985	
021986	deeply,
021987	Although it grieved
021988	
021989	the king
021990	request because of
021991	
021992	his oath
021993	
021994	
021995	and his guests.
021996	he did not
021997	want
021998	to reject her
021999	
022000	
022001	at once
022002	sent
022003	
022004	So the king
022005	an executioner
022006	
022007	to bring
022008	
022009	John’s head,
022010	
022011	
022012	and he went
022013	and beheaded
022014	
022015	
022016	
022017	John in prison.
022018	
022019	He brought
022020	
022021	his head
022022	
022023	on
022024	a platter
022025	
022026	and gave it
022027	
022028	
022029	to the girl,
022030	
022031	
022032	and the girl
022033	gave it
022034	
022035	
022036	to her mother.
022037	
022038	
022039	heard
022040	
022041	When John’s disciples
022042	
022043	this, they came
022044	
022045	and took
022046	
022047	his body
022048	
022049	
022050	and placed it
022051	
022052	in
022053	a tomb.
022054	
022055	gathered
022056	
022057	Then the apostles
022058	around
022059	
022060	Jesus
022061	
022062	and told him
022063	
022064	everything
022065	
022066	they had done
022067	
022068	
022069	and taught.
022070	
022071	He said to them,
022072	
022073	“Come
022074	
022075	
022076	
022077	with me privately
022078	to
022079	an isolated
022080	place
022081	
022082	and rest
022083	a while”
022084	were
022085	(for
022086	
022087	coming
022088	
022089	
022090	and going,
022091	many
022092	
022093	and there was no
022094	to eat).
022095	time
022096	
022097	So they went away
022098	in
022099	
022100	a boat
022101	to
022102	some remote
022103	place.
022104	by
022105	themselves
022106	
022107	saw them
022108	
022109	leaving
022110	
022111	and recognized them,
022112	But many
022113	
022114	and they hurried on foot
022115	from
022116	all
022117	
022118	the towns
022119	and arrived
022120	there
022121	
022122	ahead of them.
022123	
022124	
022125	As Jesus came ashore
022126	he saw
022127	the large
022128	crowd
022129	
022130	and he had compassion
022131	on them,
022132	
022133	
022134	because they were
022135	like
022136	
022137	sheep
022138	without
022139	a shepherd.
022140	
022141	
022142	So he taught them
022143	
022144	many things.
022145	
022146	already
022147	late,
022148	very
022149	When it was
022150	came to him
022151	
022152	
022153	his disciples
022154	
022155	and said,
022156	
022157	an isolated
022158	“This is
022159	
022160	place
022161	
022162	and it is already
022163	late.
022164	
022165	Send
022166	them away
022167	so that
022168	they can go
022169	into
022170	
022171	the surrounding
022172	countryside
022173	
022174	and villages
022175	and buy
022176	for themselves
022177	something
022178	to eat.”
022179	
022180	But
022181	he answered them,
022182	
022183	
022184	“You give them
022185	
022186	
022187	something to eat.”
022188	
022189	And they said,
022190	
022191	“Should we go
022192	and buy
022193	silver coins
022194	for two hundred
022195	bread
022196	
022197	and give it to them
022198	
022199	to eat?”
022200	
022201	
022202	He said to them,
022203	
022204	“How many
022205	loaves
022206	do you have?
022207	Go
022208	and see.”
022209	
022210	When they found out,
022211	they said,
022212	“Five –
022213	
022214	and two
022215	fish.”
022216	
022217	Then he directed them
022218	
022219	to sit down
022220	all
022221	in groups
022222	
022223	on
022224	
022225	the green
022226	grass.
022227	
022228	So they reclined
022229	in groups
022230	
022231	of
022232	hundreds
022233	
022234	
022235	and fifties.
022236	
022237	He took
022238	
022239	the five
022240	loaves
022241	
022242	
022243	and the two
022244	fish,
022245	and looking up
022246	to
022247	
022248	heaven,
022249	he gave thanks
022250	
022251	and broke
022252	
022253	the loaves.
022254	
022255	He gave
022256	
022257	them to his disciples
022258	
022259	to
022260	serve
022261	
022262	
022263	
022264	the two
022265	fish
022266	the people, and he divided
022267	among them all.
022268	
022269	ate
022270	They all
022271	
022272	and were satisfied,
022273	
022274	and they picked up
022275	the broken pieces
022276	that were left over, twelve
022277	baskets
022278	full.
022279	
022280	
022281	
022282	and fish
022283	
022284	Now there were
022285	
022286	who ate
022287	
022288	the bread.
022289	five thousand
022290	men
022291	
022292	Immediately
022293	Jesus made
022294	
022295	his disciples
022296	
022297	get
022298	into
022299	
022300	the boat
022301	
022302	and go on ahead
022303	to
022304	
022305	the other side,
022306	to
022307	Bethsaida,
022308	while
022309	
022310	he dispersed
022311	
022312	the crowd.
022313	
022314	After saying goodbye to them,
022315	
022316	he went
022317	to
022318	
022319	the mountain
022320	to pray.
022321	
022322	When evening
022323	came,
022324	was
022325	
022326	the boat
022327	in
022328	the middle
022329	
022330	of the sea
022331	
022332	
022333	and he was alone
022334	on
022335	
022336	the land.
022337	
022338	He saw them
022339	
022340	straining
022341	at
022342	
022343	the oars,
022344	was
022345	because
022346	
022347	the wind
022348	against them.
022349	
022350	
022351	
022352	was ending,
022353	
022354	As the night
022355	he came
022356	to them
022357	
022358	walking
022359	on
022360	
022361	the sea,
022362	
022363	for he wanted
022364	to pass by them.
022365	
022366	
022367	
022368	When they saw him
022369	
022370	on
022371	
022372	the water
022373	walking
022374	they thought
022375	
022376	a ghost.
022377	he was
022378	
022379	They cried out,
022380	they all
022381	for
022382	
022383	saw him
022384	
022385	and were terrified.
022386	
022387	But
022388	immediately
022389	he spoke
022390	to them:
022391	
022392	
022393	
022394	
022395	“Have courage!
022396	
022397	It is
022398	I. Do not
022399	be afraid.”
022400	
022401	Then he went up
022402	with them
022403	
022404	into
022405	
022406	the boat,
022407	
022408	ceased.
022409	
022410	and the wind
022411	
022412	They were completely
022413	
022414	
022415	
022416	
022417	astonished,
022418	they did not
022419	because
022420	understand
022421	about
022422	
022423	the loaves,
022424	but
022425	were
022426	
022427	
022428	their hearts
022429	hardened.
022430	
022431	After they had crossed over,
022432	to
022433	
022434	land
022435	they came
022436	at
022437	Gennesaret
022438	
022439	and anchored there.
022440	
022441	As they got out
022442	
022443	of
022444	
022445	the boat,
022446	people immediately
022447	recognized Jesus.
022448	
022449	They ran through
022450	whole
022451	
022452	region
022453	that
022454	
022455	and began
022456	on
022457	
022458	mats
022459	
022460	the sick
022461	
022462	to bring
022463	to wherever
022464	he was rumored
022465	
022466	to be.
022467	
022468	And wherever
022469	
022470	he would go –
022471	into
022472	villages,
022473	
022474	
022475	towns,
022476	or
022477	
022478	countryside –
022479	in
022480	
022481	the marketplaces,
022482	they would place
022483	
022484	the sick
022485	
022486	and would ask him
022487	
022488	
022489	if
022490	
022491	the edge
022492	
022493	of his cloak,
022494	
022495	they could just touch
022496	
022497	and all
022498	
022499	who touched
022500	
022501	it were healed.
022502	
022503	gathered
022504	around him.
022505	
022506	
022507	Now the Pharisees
022508	
022509	and some
022510	
022511	of the experts in the law
022512	who came
022513	from
022514	Jerusalem
022515	
022516	And they saw
022517	that some
022518	
022519	of Jesus’ disciples
022520	
022521	
022522	with unclean
022523	hands,
022524	
022525	that is,
022526	unwashed.
022527	ate
022528	
022529	their bread
022530	
022531	(For
022532	the Pharisees
022533	
022534	and all
022535	
022536	the Jews
022537	
022538	unless
022539	they perform a ritual
022540	washing,
022541	
022542	
022543	do not
022544	eat
022545	holding fast
022546	
022547	to the tradition
022548	
022549	of the elders.
022550	
022551	And when they come from
022552	the marketplace,
022553	
022554	unless
022555	they wash.
022556	they do not
022557	eat
022558	
022559	other
022560	to many
022561	
022562	
022563	traditions:
022564	They hold fast
022565	the washing
022566	of cups,
022567	
022568	pots,
022569	
022570	kettles,
022571	
022572	and dining couches.)
022573	
022574	asked him,
022575	
022576	
022577	The Pharisees
022578	
022579	
022580	and the experts in the law
022581	
022582	“Why
022583	not
022584	live
022585	
022586	do your disciples
022587	
022588	according to
022589	
022590	the tradition
022591	
022592	of the elders,
022593	but
022594	with unwashed
022595	hands?”
022596	eat
022597	
022598	
022599	
022600	
022601	He said to them,
022602	
022603	correctly
022604	prophesied
022605	“Isaiah
022606	about you
022607	
022608	
022609	hypocrites,
022610	as
022611	it is written:
022612	
022613	
022614	
022615	‘This people
022616	
022617	with their lips,
022618	
022619	honors me
022620	
022621	but
022622	their heart
022623	
022624	far
022625	is
022626	from me.
022627	
022628	in vain,
022629	
022630	They worship me
022631	
022632	teaching
022633	as doctrine
022634	the commandments
022635	of men.’
022636	Having no regard
022637	
022638	for the command
022639	
022640	of God,
022641	you hold fast
022642	
022643	tradition.”
022644	
022645	to human
022646	
022647	He also said to them,
022648	
022649	“You neatly
022650	reject
022651	
022652	the commandment
022653	
022654	of God
022655	in order to
022656	
022657	your tradition.
022658	
022659	set up
022660	Moses
022661	For
022662	said,
022663	‘Honor
022664	
022665	your father
022666	
022667	
022668	
022669	and your mother,’
022670	
022671	
022672	
022673	and, ‘Whoever insults
022674	his father
022675	or
022676	mother
022677	to death.’
022678	must be put
022679	
022680	But
022681	you say
022682	that if
022683	tells
022684	anyone
022685	
022686	his father
022687	or
022688	
022689	mother,
022690	is corban’
022691	(that
022692	is,
022693	a gift for God),
022694	‘Whatever
022695	
022696	from me
022697	
022698	help you would have received
022699	then you no longer
022700	permit him
022701	
022702	anything
022703	to do
022704	
022705	for his father
022706	or
022707	
022708	mother.
022709	Thus you nullify
022710	
022711	the word
022712	
022713	of God
022714	
022715	by your tradition
022716	
022717	that
022718	you have handed down.
022719	
022720	like
022721	this.”
022722	many things
022723	And you do
022724	
022725	Then he called
022726	again
022727	
022728	the crowd
022729	and said to them,
022730	
022731	“Listen to me,
022732	
022733	everyone,
022734	
022735	and understand.
022736	nothing
022737	There is
022738	outside
022739	
022740	of a person
022741	by going
022742	into him.
022743	
022744	that
022745	can
022746	defile him
022747	
022748	Rather,
022749	
022750	of
022751	
022752	a person
022753	what comes out
022754	it is
022755	that
022756	defiles
022757	
022758	him.”
022759	
022760	Now when
022761	and entered
022762	
022763	the house,
022764	
022765	
022766	Jesus had left the crowd
022767	asked him
022768	
022769	
022770	his disciples
022771	
022772	
022773	about the parable.
022774	
022775	He said to them,
022776	
022777	
022778	
022779	
022780	so foolish?
022781	“Are you
022782	Don’t
022783	you understand
022784	
022785	that whatever
022786	
022787	from outside
022788	goes
022789	into
022790	
022791	a person
022792	
022793	cannot
022794	
022795	defile him?
022796	
022797	For it does not
022798	enter
022799	
022800	into
022801	
022802	his heart
022803	but
022804	
022805	
022806	his stomach,
022807	
022808	
022809	
022810	the sewer.”
022811	and then goes out
022812	are clean.)
022813	(This means all
022814	
022815	foods
022816	He said,
022817	
022818	
022819	
022820	of
022821	
022822	a person
022823	“What comes out
022824	
022825	defiles
022826	
022827	him.
022828	from within,
022829	For
022830	out of
022831	
022832	heart,
022833	
022834	the human
022835	
022836	ideas,
022837	
022838	evil
022839	come
022840	sexual immorality,
022841	theft,
022842	murder,
022843	adultery,
022844	greed,
022845	evil,
022846	deceit,
022847	debauchery,
022848	envy,
022849	
022850	slander,
022851	pride,
022852	and folly.
022853	All
022854	
022855	
022856	these evils
022857	from within
022858	come
022859	
022860	and defile
022861	
022862	a person.”
022863	there,
022864	
022865	After Jesus left
022866	he went
022867	to
022868	
022869	the region
022870	of Tyre.
022871	
022872	When he went
022873	into
022874	a house,
022875	he did not
022876	want anyone
022877	to know,
022878	
022879	but he was not
022880	able
022881	to escape notice.
022882	Instead,
022883	immediately
022884	heard
022885	a woman
022886	about him
022887	
022888	
022889	had
022890	
022891	whose young daughter
022892	
022893	spirit
022894	an unclean
022895	and came
022896	and fell
022897	at
022898	
022899	his feet.
022900	
022901	
022902	
022903	The woman
022904	was
022905	a Greek,
022906	of Syrophoenician
022907	
022908	origin.
022909	
022910	She asked him
022911	
022912	to
022913	
022914	the demon
022915	cast
022916	out of
022917	
022918	her daughter.
022919	
022920	
022921	He said to her,
022922	
022923	“Let
022924	first,
022925	be satisfied
022926	
022927	the children
022928	not
022929	for
022930	it is
022931	right
022932	to take
022933	
022934	bread
022935	
022936	the children’s
022937	
022938	
022939	it to the dogs.”
022940	and to throw
022941	
022942	
022943	She answered,
022944	
022945	
022946	
022947	“Yes, Lord,
022948	
022949	
022950	but even the dogs
022951	under
022952	
022953	the table
022954	eat
022955	
022956	
022957	crumbs.”
022958	
022959	the children’s
022960	
022961	Then he said to her,
022962	
022963	“Because
022964	
022965	
022966	you said this,
022967	you may go.
022968	has left
022969	
022970	
022971	your daughter.”
022972	
022973	
022974	The demon
022975	
022976	She went
022977	
022978	
022979	home
022980	
022981	and found
022982	
022983	the child
022984	lying
022985	on
022986	
022987	the bed,
022988	
022989	
022990	and the demon
022991	gone.
022992	
022993	again
022994	Then Jesus went out
022995	from
022996	
022997	the region
022998	of Tyre
022999	and came
023000	through
023001	Sidon
023002	to
023003	
023004	the Sea
023005	
023006	of Galilee
023007	in
023008	
023009	
023010	the region
023011	of the Decapolis.
023012	
023013	They brought to him
023014	
023015	a deaf man
023016	
023017	who had difficulty speaking,
023018	
023019	and they asked him
023020	
023021	to
023022	place
023023	on him.
023024	
023025	his hands
023026	
023027	After Jesus took
023028	him aside
023029	away from
023030	
023031	the crowd,
023032	
023033	privately,
023034	he put
023035	
023036	his fingers
023037	
023038	in
023039	
023040	the man’s ears,
023041	
023042	
023043	and after spitting,
023044	he touched
023045	
023046	his tongue.
023047	
023048	
023049	Then he looked up
023050	to
023051	
023052	heaven
023053	with a sigh,
023054	
023055	and said
023056	
023057	“Ephphatha”
023058	(that
023059	is,
023060	“Be opened”).
023061	
023062	And immediately
023063	were opened,
023064	
023065	
023066	the man’s ears
023067	
023068	loosened,
023069	
023070	
023071	
023072	his tongue
023073	
023074	
023075	and he spoke
023076	plainly.
023077	
023078	Jesus ordered them
023079	
023080	to
023081	not
023082	tell anyone.
023083	as much as
023084	But
023085	
023086	he ordered
023087	them not to do this,
023088	the more.
023089	all
023090	they proclaimed it
023091	
023092	People were completely
023093	astounded
023094	and said,
023095	well.
023096	everything
023097	“He has done
023098	
023099	
023100	the deaf
023101	He even makes
023102	hear
023103	
023104	
023105	and the mute
023106	speak.”
023107	In
023108	those
023109	
023110	days
023111	another
023112	large
023113	crowd
023114	there was
023115	
023116	with nothing
023117	
023118	
023119	to eat.
023120	So Jesus called
023121	
023122	his disciples
023123	and said to them,
023124	
023125	“I have compassion
023126	on
023127	
023128	the crowd,
023129	
023130	because they have already
023131	days,
023132	three
023133	been here with me
023134	
023135	
023136	
023137	and they have
023138	nothing
023139	to eat.
023140	
023141	If
023142	I send them
023143	
023144	hungry,
023145	
023146	home
023147	
023148	they will faint
023149	on
023150	
023151	the way,
023152	
023153	and some of them
023154	
023155	from
023156	a great distance.”
023157	have come
023158	
023159	answered him,
023160	
023161	
023162	His disciples
023163	
023164	
023165	“Where
023166	
023167	can
023168	someone
023169	this
023170	to satisfy these people?”
023171	get enough bread
023172	in
023173	desolate place
023174	
023175	He asked them,
023176	
023177	“How many
023178	do you have?”
023179	loaves
023180	
023181	
023182	They replied,
023183	“Seven.”
023184	
023185	Then he directed
023186	
023187	the crowd
023188	to sit down
023189	on
023190	
023191	the ground.
023192	
023193	After he took
023194	
023195	the seven
023196	loaves
023197	and gave thanks,
023198	he broke
023199	
023200	them and began giving
023201	
023202	them to the disciples
023203	
023204	to
023205	serve.
023206	
023207	So they served
023208	
023209	the crowd.
023210	
023211	They also had
023212	small fish.
023213	a few
023214	
023215	After giving thanks for these,
023216	
023217	he told
023218	
023219	
023220	them to serve these as well.
023221	
023222	Everyone ate
023223	
023224	and was satisfied,
023225	
023226	and they picked up
023227	left over,
023228	the broken pieces
023229	seven
023230	baskets full.
023231	There were
023232	
023233	about
023234	four thousand who ate.
023235	
023236	Then he dismissed them.
023237	
023238	
023239	Immediately
023240	he got
023241	into
023242	
023243	a boat
023244	with
023245	
023246	his disciples
023247	
023248	and went
023249	to
023250	
023251	the district
023252	of Dalmanutha.
023253	
023254	came
023255	
023256	Then the Pharisees
023257	
023258	and began
023259	to argue
023260	
023261	with Jesus, asking
023262	
023263	
023264	for a sign
023265	from
023266	
023267	heaven
023268	to test him.
023269	
023270	
023271	Sighing deeply
023272	
023273	in his spirit
023274	
023275	he said,
023276	“Why
023277	
023278	does this generation
023279	
023280	look for
023281	a sign?
023282	the truth,
023283	I tell you
023284	
023285	no
023286	will be given
023287	
023288	to this generation.”
023289	
023290	sign
023291	
023292	Then he left them,
023293	
023294	back into
023295	got
023296	the boat, and went
023297	to
023298	
023299	the other side.
023300	
023301	Now they had forgotten
023302	to take
023303	bread,
023304	
023305	
023306	except
023307	for one
023308	loaf
023309	
023310	they had
023311	with
023312	them
023313	in
023314	
023315	the boat.
023316	
023317	And Jesus ordered them,
023318	
023319	
023320	“Watch out!
023321	Beware
023322	of
023323	
023324	the yeast
023325	
023326	of the Pharisees
023327	
023328	
023329	and the yeast
023330	of Herod!”
023331	
023332	So they began to discuss
023333	with
023334	one another
023335	
023336	bread.
023337	no
023338	about having
023339	
023340	When he learned
023341	of this, Jesus said to them,
023342	
023343	“Why
023344	are you arguing
023345	
023346	bread?
023347	no
023348	about having
023349	Do you still not
023350	see
023351	or
023352	understand?
023353	been hardened?
023354	Have
023355	
023356	your hearts
023357	
023358	eyes,
023359	Though you have
023360	don’t
023361	you see?
023362	
023363	ears,
023364	And though you have
023365	can’t
023366	you hear?
023367	
023368	Don’t
023369	you remember?
023370	When
023371	
023372	the five
023373	loaves
023374	I broke
023375	for
023376	
023377	the five thousand,
023378	how many
023379	baskets
023380	of pieces
023381	full
023382	did you pick up?”
023383	They replied,
023384	
023385	“Twelve.”
023386	“When
023387	
023388	I broke the seven
023389	loaves for
023390	
023391	the four thousand,
023392	how many
023393	baskets
023394	full
023395	of pieces
023396	did you pick up?”
023397	
023398	They replied,
023399	
023400	“Seven.”
023401	
023402	Then he said to them,
023403	
023404	“Do you still not
023405	understand?”
023406	
023407	Then they came
023408	to
023409	Bethsaida.
023410	
023411	They brought
023412	
023413	a blind man
023414	
023415	to Jesus and asked him
023416	
023417	to
023418	
023419	touch him.
023420	
023421	He took
023422	
023423	by the hand
023424	
023425	the blind man
023426	and brought him
023427	
023428	outside
023429	
023430	of the village.
023431	
023432	Then he spit
023433	on
023434	
023435	his eyes,
023436	
023437	placed
023438	
023439	his hands
023440	on his eyes
023441	and asked,
023442	
023443	
023444	anything?”
023445	“Do you see
023446	
023447	Regaining his sight
023448	he said,
023449	“I see
023450	
023451	people,
023452	
023453	like
023454	trees
023455	but they look
023456	walking.”
023457	Then
023458	again.
023459	Jesus placed
023460	
023461	his hands
023462	on
023463	
023464	the man’s eyes
023465	
023466	
023467	And he opened his eyes,
023468	
023469	his sight was restored,
023470	
023471	and he saw
023472	clearly.
023473	everything
023474	
023475	Jesus sent him
023476	
023477	into
023478	home,
023479	
023480	saying,
023481	“Do not even
023482	
023483	
023484	the village.”
023485	go
023486	
023487	went
023488	
023489	Then Jesus
023490	
023491	
023492	and his disciples
023493	
023494	to
023495	
023496	the villages
023497	of Caesarea
023498	
023499	Philippi.
023500	
023501	On
023502	
023503	the way
023504	he asked
023505	
023506	his disciples,
023507	
023508	say
023509	
023510	“Who
023511	
023512	
023513	
023514	do people
023515	that I am?”
023516	
023517	
023518	
023519	
023520	They said,
023521	
023522	“John
023523	
023524	the Baptist,
023525	
023526	others
023527	say Elijah,
023528	still others,
023529	and
023530	
023531	one
023532	
023533	of the prophets.”
023534	
023535	
023536	He asked them,
023537	
023538	
023539	“But
023540	who
023541	
023542	do you say
023543	that I am?”
023544	answered him,
023545	
023546	Peter
023547	
023548	
023549	
023550	“You are
023551	
023552	the Christ.”
023553	
023554	Then he warned them
023555	
023556	not to
023557	anyone
023558	tell
023559	about him.
023560	
023561	
023562	Then Jesus began
023563	to teach them
023564	
023565	
023566	must
023567	
023568	that the Son
023569	
023570	of Man
023571	many things
023572	suffer
023573	
023574	and be rejected
023575	by
023576	
023577	the elders,
023578	
023579	
023580	chief priests,
023581	
023582	
023583	and experts in the law,
023584	
023585	and be killed,
023586	
023587	and after
023588	three
023589	days
023590	rise again.
023591	
023592	openly
023593	
023594	about this.
023595	He spoke
023596	
023597	took
023598	
023599	So Peter
023600	him aside
023601	and began
023602	to rebuke him.
023603	
023604	
023605	But
023606	after turning
023607	
023608	and looking at
023609	
023610	his disciples,
023611	
023612	he rebuked
023613	Peter
023614	
023615	and said,
023616	“Get
023617	behind me,
023618	
023619	Satan.
023620	
023621	You are not
023622	setting your mind on
023623	
023624	
023625	God’s
023626	interests, but
023627	
023628	
023629	on man’s.”
023630	
023631	Then Jesus called
023632	
023633	the crowd,
023634	along with
023635	
023636	his disciples,
023637	
023638	and said to them,
023639	
023640	“If
023641	anyone
023642	wants to become my
023643	
023644	
023645	follower,
023646	he must deny
023647	himself,
023648	
023649	take up
023650	
023651	his cross,
023652	
023653	
023654	and follow me.
023655	
023656	whoever
023657	For
023658	
023659	wants
023660	
023661	his life
023662	
023663	to save
023664	will lose it,
023665	
023666	whoever
023667	but
023668	
023669	loses
023670	
023671	his life
023672	
023673	because of me
023674	
023675	
023676	
023677	and because of the gospel
023678	will save it.
023679	
023680	what
023681	For
023682	benefit
023683	is it for a person
023684	to gain
023685	
023686	world,
023687	the whole
023688	
023689	yet forfeit
023690	
023691	his life?
023692	
023693	What
023694	
023695	give
023696	can a person
023697	in exchange
023698	
023699	for his life?
023700	
023701	anyone
023702	For
023703	if
023704	is ashamed of me
023705	
023706	
023707	
023708	and my
023709	words
023710	in
023711	
023712	generation,
023713	
023714	
023715	this adulterous
023716	
023717	and sinful
023718	
023719	
023720	the Son
023721	
023722	of Man
023723	will also be ashamed of him
023724	
023725	when
023726	he comes
023727	in
023728	
023729	the glory
023730	
023731	of his Father
023732	
023733	with
023734	
023735	angels.”
023736	
023737	the holy
023738	
023739	And he said to them,
023740	
023741	the truth,
023742	“I tell you
023743	
023744	
023745	there are
023746	some
023747	here
023748	
023749	standing
023750	who
023751	
023752	will not
023753	experience
023754	death
023755	before
023756	
023757	they see
023758	
023759	the kingdom
023760	
023761	of God
023762	come
023763	with
023764	power.”
023765	
023766	later
023767	days
023768	Six
023769	took with
023770	
023771	Jesus
023772	
023773	him Peter,
023774	
023775	
023776	James,
023777	
023778	
023779	and John
023780	
023781	and led them
023782	
023783	up
023784	mountain
023785	a high
023786	
023787	privately.
023788	alone
023789	
023790	And he was transfigured
023791	before them,
023792	
023793	
023794	
023795	and his clothes
023796	
023797	became
023798	radiantly
023799	white,
023800	more
023801	so
023802	than any launderer
023803	in
023804	
023805	the world
023806	
023807	could
023808	
023809	bleach them.
023810	
023811	appeared before them
023812	
023813	Then Elijah
023814	along with
023815	Moses,
023816	
023817	and they were
023818	talking
023819	
023820	with Jesus.
023821	
023822	
023823	
023824	So Peter
023825	said
023826	
023827	to Jesus,
023828	“Rabbi,
023829	good for us
023830	it is
023831	
023832	here. Let us
023833	to be
023834	
023835	make
023836	three
023837	shelters –
023838	
023839	one for you,
023840	
023841	for Moses,
023842	one
023843	
023844	for Elijah.”
023845	and one
023846	and he did not
023847	(For
023848	know
023849	what
023850	to say.)
023851	afraid,
023852	
023853	they were
023854	
023855	came
023856	Then a cloud
023857	overshadowed them,
023858	
023859	
023860	
023861	and a voice
023862	from
023863	
023864	the cloud,
023865	
023866	“This is
023867	
023868	Son.
023869	
023870	
023871	my one dear
023872	Listen to him!”
023873	
023874	
023875	Suddenly
023876	when they looked around,
023877	any more
023878	no one
023879	they saw
023880	except
023881	
023882	Jesus.
023883	
023884	with
023885	them
023886	
023887	As they were coming down
023888	
023889	from
023890	
023891	the mountain,
023892	he gave them
023893	
023894	orders
023895	not
023896	what
023897	they had seen
023898	to tell anyone
023899	
023900	after
023901	until
023902	
023903	the Son
023904	
023905	of Man
023906	from
023907	the dead.
023908	had risen
023909	
023910	
023911	this statement
023912	They kept
023913	to
023914	themselves,
023915	discussing
023916	what
023917	meant.
023918	
023919	from
023920	the dead
023921	this rising
023922	
023923	Then they asked him,
023924	
023925	say
023926	
023927	
023928	
023929	“Why do the experts in the law
023930	
023931	that Elijah
023932	must
023933	come
023934	first?”
023935	
023936	
023937	He said to them,
023938	
023939	“Elijah
023940	does indeed
023941	come
023942	first,
023943	and restores
023944	all things.
023945	
023946	And why
023947	is it written
023948	
023949	
023950	the Son
023951	
023952	of Man
023953	that
023954	many things
023955	must suffer
023956	
023957	and be despised?
023958	But
023959	I tell you
023960	
023961	
023962	
023963	that Elijah
023964	has certainly come,
023965	
023966	and they did to him
023967	
023968	whatever
023969	they wanted,
023970	just as
023971	it is written
023972	about him.”
023973	
023974	
023975	When they came
023976	to
023977	
023978	the disciples,
023979	they saw
023980	crowd
023981	a large
023982	around them
023983	
023984	
023985	and experts in the law
023986	arguing
023987	with them.
023988	
023989	
023990	at once
023991	When the whole
023992	
023993	crowd
023994	saw him,
023995	
023996	they were amazed
023997	
023998	and ran
023999	and greeted him.
024000	
024001	
024002	He asked them,
024003	
024004	“What
024005	are you arguing about
024006	with them?”
024007	
024008	
024009	said to him,
024010	
024011	A member
024012	of
024013	
024014	the crowd
024015	“Teacher,
024016	I brought you
024017	
024018	my son,
024019	
024020	
024021	
024022	who is possessed
024023	by a spirit
024024	that makes him mute.
024025	
024026	Whenever
024027	
024028	
024029	it seizes him,
024030	it throws
024031	him down,
024032	
024033	and he foams at the mouth,
024034	
024035	grinds
024036	
024037	his teeth,
024038	
024039	and becomes rigid.
024040	
024041	I asked
024042	
024043	your disciples
024044	
024045	to
024046	it out,
024047	cast
024048	
024049	but they were not
024050	able to do so.”
024051	
024052	
024053	He answered them,
024054	
024055	
024056	“You
024057	generation!
024058	unbelieving
024059	How much
024060	longer
024061	with you?
024062	
024063	must I be
024064	How much
024065	longer
024066	must I endure
024067	
024068	you? Bring him
024069	
024070	to me.”
024071	
024072	
024073	So they brought
024074	
024075	the boy to him.
024076	
024077	
024078	saw him,
024079	
024080	
024081	When the spirit
024082	it immediately
024083	threw
024084	the boy into a convulsion.
024085	
024086	He fell
024087	on
024088	
024089	the ground
024090	and rolled around,
024091	foaming at the mouth.
024092	
024093	Jesus asked
024094	
024095	his father,
024096	
024097	“How
024098	long
024099	
024100	
024101	
024102	has this been happening to him?”
024103	
024104	
024105	And
024106	he said,
024107	“From
024108	childhood.
024109	
024110	It has often
024111	
024112	into
024113	fire
024114	
024115	thrown him
024116	
024117	
024118	or water
024119	to
024120	destroy him.
024121	
024122	But
024123	if
024124	to do anything,
024125	you are able
024126	and help us.”
024127	
024128	have compassion
024129	on us
024130	
024131	
024132	Then
024133	Jesus
024134	said to him,
024135	
024136	
024137	“‘If
024138	you are able?’
024139	All things
024140	are possible
024141	
024142	for the one who believes.”
024143	Immediately
024144	cried out
024145	
024146	the father
024147	
024148	of the boy
024149	and said,
024150	“I believe;
024151	help
024152	
024153	
024154	my unbelief!”
024155	saw
024156	Now
024157	
024158	when Jesus
024159	
024160	was quickly gathering,
024161	that a crowd
024162	he rebuked
024163	
024164	spirit,
024165	
024166	the unclean
024167	saying to it,
024168	
024169	
024170	“Mute
024171	
024172	and deaf
024173	spirit,
024174	
024175	I command you,
024176	
024177	come out
024178	of him
024179	
024180	
024181	and never
024182	enter him again.”
024183	
024184	
024185	
024186	It shrieked,
024187	
024188	terrible convulsions,
024189	threw him into
024190	and came out.
024191	
024192	The boy looked
024193	so much like
024194	a corpse
024195	that
024196	
024197	many
024198	said,
024199	
024200	“He is dead!”
024201	
024202	But
024203	Jesus
024204	gently took
024205	
024206	his hand
024207	
024208	and raised him to his feet,
024209	
024210	
024211	and he stood up.
024212	
024213	Then, after he went
024214	
024215	into
024216	the house,
024217	
024218	his disciples
024219	
024220	
024221	privately,
024222	asked him
024223	
024224	
024225	
024226	
024227	“Why couldn’t
024228	we cast
024229	it out?”
024230	
024231	He told them,
024232	
024233	
024234	
024235	“This kind
024236	
024237	
024238	can
024239	come out
024240	
024241	only
024242	by
024243	prayer.”
024244	from there
024245	They went out
024246	and passed
024247	through
024248	
024249	Galilee.
024250	
024251	But Jesus did not
024252	want
024253	
024254	anyone
024255	to know,
024256	he was teaching
024257	for
024258	
024259	his disciples
024260	
024261	
024262	and telling them,
024263	
024264	
024265	
024266	“The Son
024267	
024268	of Man
024269	will be betrayed
024270	into
024271	the hands
024272	of men.
024273	
024274	They will kill him,
024275	
024276	
024277	
024278	and after
024279	three
024280	days
024281	he will rise.”
024282	
024283	But
024284	they did not understand
024285	
024286	this statement
024287	
024288	and were afraid
024289	
024290	to ask him.
024291	
024292	Then they came
024293	to
024294	Capernaum.
024295	
024296	inside
024297	
024298	the house
024299	After Jesus was
024300	he asked them,
024301	
024302	“What
024303	on
024304	
024305	the way?”
024306	were you discussing
024307	
024308	But
024309	they were silent,
024310	with
024311	one another
024312	for
024313	they had argued
024314	on
024315	
024316	the way
024317	about who
024318	was the greatest.
024319	
024320	After he sat down,
024321	he called
024322	
024323	the twelve
024324	
024325	and said to them,
024326	
024327	“If
024328	anyone
024329	wants
024330	first,
024331	to be
024332	he must be
024333	of all
024334	last
024335	
024336	of all.”
024337	and servant
024338	
024339	He took
024340	a little child and had him
024341	stand
024342	
024343	among them.
024344	
024345	
024346	
024347	Taking
024348	him in his arms,
024349	he said to them,
024350	
024351	“Whoever
024352	
024353	one
024354	
024355	of these
024356	little children
024357	welcomes
024358	in
024359	
024360	my name
024361	
024362	
024363	welcomes me,
024364	
024365	and whoever
024366	
024367	
024368	welcomes me
024369	does not
024370	
024371	welcome me
024372	but
024373	
024374	the one who sent me.”
024375	
024376	said to him,
024377	
024378	
024379	John
024380	“Teacher,
024381	we saw
024382	someone
024383	in
024384	
024385	your name,
024386	
024387	casting out
024388	demons
024389	
024390	and we tried to stop him
024391	
024392	
024393	because he was not
024394	following us.”
024395	
024396	
024397	But
024398	Jesus
024399	said,
024400	“Do not
024401	stop him,
024402	
024403	no one
024404	because
024405	
024406	who
024407	does
024408	a miracle
024409	in
024410	
024411	my name
024412	
024413	
024414	will be able
024415	soon afterward
024416	to say anything bad about me.
024417	
024418	whoever
024419	For
024420	not
024421	is
024422	against us

024424	for us.

024426	is
024427	whoever
024428	For
024429	
024430	gives you

024433	of water
024434	
024435	name
024436	
024437	Christ’s
024438	because you bear
024439	the truth,
024440	I tell you
024441	
024442	
024443	
024444	will never
024445	lose
024446	
024447	his reward.

024597	each other.”
024598	
024599	that place
024600	Then Jesus left
024601	and went
024602	to
024603	
024604	the region
024605	
024606	of Judea
024607	
024608	and beyond
024609	
024610	the Jordan River.
024611	
024612	gathered
024613	Again
024614	crowds
024615	to
024616	him,
024617	
024618	as
024619	was his custom,
024620	and again,
024621	he taught them.
024622	
024623	
024624	came,
024625	Then some Pharisees
024626	they asked,
024627	
024628	
024629	“Is it lawful
024630	for a man
024631	his wife?”
024632	to divorce
024633	and to test him
024634	
024635	
024636	
024637	He answered them,
024638	
024639	
024640	“What
024641	
024642	command you?”
024643	did Moses
024644	
024645	
024646	They said,
024647	permitted
024648	“Moses
024649	a certificate
024650	of dismissal
024651	a man to write
024652	
024653	and to divorce her.”
024654	
024655	But
024656	Jesus
024657	said to them,
024658	
024659	because of
024660	
024661	your hard hearts.
024662	
024663	“He wrote
024664	
024665	
024666	this commandment for you
024667	
024668	from
024669	But
024670	the beginning
024671	of creation
024672	male
024673	
024674	and female.
024675	he made them
024676	
024677	For
024678	
024679	will leave
024680	this reason a man
024681	
024682	his father
024683	
024684	
024685	
024686	and mother,

024689	
024690	
024691	
024692	
024693	
024694	will become
024695	
024696	and the two
024697	
024698	flesh.
024699	one
024700	So
024701	no longer
024702	they are
024703	two,
024704	but
024705	one
024706	flesh.
024707	what
024708	Therefore
024709	
024710	God
024711	has joined together,
024712	one
024713	let no
024714	separate.”
024715	
024716	In
024717	
024718	the house
024719	once again,
024720	
024721	the disciples
024722	about this.
024723	
024724	asked him
024725	
024726	
024727	So he told them,
024728	
024729	“Whoever
024730	
024731	divorces
024732	
024733	his wife
024734	
024735	
024736	and marries
024737	another
024738	commits adultery
024739	against her.
024740	
024741	
024742	And if
024743	
024744	she divorces
024745	
024746	her husband
024747	
024748	and marries
024749	another,
024750	she commits adultery.”
024751	
024752	Now people were bringing
024753	
024754	little children to him
024755	for
024756	
024757	him to touch,
024758	
024759	but
024760	the disciples
024761	scolded those who brought them.
024762	
024763	saw
024764	But
024765	
024766	when Jesus
024767	this, he was indignant
024768	
024769	and said to them,
024770	
024771	“Let
024772	
024773	the little children
024774	come
024775	to
024776	me
024777	and do not
024778	try to stop them,
024779	
024780	
024781	for
024782	such as these.
024783	belongs to
024784	
024785	the kingdom
024786	
024787	of God
024788	the truth,
024789	I tell you
024790	
024791	whoever
024792	
024793	does not
024794	receive
024795	
024796	the kingdom
024797	
024798	of God
024799	like
024800	a child
024801	
024802	will never
024803	enter it.”
024804	
024805	
024806	
024807	After he took
024808	the children in his arms,
024809	and blessed them.
024810	he placed
024811	
024812	his hands
024813	on them
024814	
024815	
024816	Now as Jesus was starting out
024817	
024818	on
024819	his way,
024820	ran up
024821	someone
024822	
024823	fell on his knees,
024824	to him,
024825	and said,
024826	
024827	teacher,
024828	“Good
024829	what
024830	must I do
024831	to
024832	life?”
024833	eternal
024834	inherit
024835	
024836	
024837	Jesus
024838	said to him,
024839	
024840	“Why
024841	
024842	good?
024843	do you call me
024844	No one
024845	is good
024846	
024847	except
024848	alone.
024849	
024850	God
024851	
024852	the commandments:
024853	You know
024854	‘Do not
024855	murder,
024856	do not
024857	commit adultery,
024858	do not
024859	steal,
024860	do not
024861	give false testimony,
024862	do not
024863	defraud,
024864	honor
024865	
024866	your father
024867	
024868	
024869	
024870	and mother.’”
024871	
024872	
024873	The man said to him,
024874	
024875	“Teacher,
024876	
024877	all
024878	I have wholeheartedly obeyed
024879	these laws since
024880	my youth.”
024881	
024882	
024883	
024884	As Jesus
024885	looked at him,
024886	
024887	he felt love for him
024888	
024889	
024890	and said,
024891	
024892	one thing.
024893	
024894	“You lack
024895	Go,
024896	whatever
024897	you have
024898	sell
024899	
024900	and give
024901	
024902	the money to the poor,
024903	
024904	and you will have
024905	treasure
024906	in
024907	heaven.
024908	
024909	Then come,
024910	follow me.”
024911	
024912	
024913	But
024914	the man looked sad
024915	at
024916	
024917	this statement,
024918	and went away
024919	sorrowful,
024920	he was
024921	for
024922	
024923	rich.
024924	very
024925	
024926	looked around
024927	
024928	Then Jesus
024929	and said
024930	
024931	to his disciples,
024932	
024933	“How
024934	hard
024935	
024936	
024937	it is for the rich
024938	
024939	to
024940	
024941	the kingdom
024942	
024943	of God!”
024944	enter
024945	
024946	
024947	The disciples
024948	were astonished
024949	at
024950	
024951	these words.
024952	
024953	
024954	But
024955	Jesus
024956	again
024957	
024958	said to them,
024959	
024960	“Children,
024961	how
024962	hard
024963	it is
024964	to
024965	
024966	the kingdom
024967	
024968	of God!
024969	enter
024970	easier
024971	It is
024972	for a camel
024973	
024974	
024975	the eye
024976	
024977	of a needle
024978	to go through
024979	than
024980	for a rich person
024981	
024982	
024983	the kingdom
024984	
024985	of God.”
024986	to enter
024987	
024988	
024989	They were even more
024990	astonished
024991	and said
024992	to
024993	one another,
024994	“Then
024995	who
024996	can
024997	be saved?”
024998	looked at them
024999	
025000	
025001	Jesus
025002	and replied,
025003	for
025004	mere humans,
025005	“This is impossible
025006	but
025007	not
025008	for
025009	God;
025010	all things
025011	
025012	are possible
025013	for
025014	
025015	God.”
025016	began
025017	to speak to him,
025018	
025019	Peter
025020	
025021	“Look,
025022	
025023	we have left
025024	everything
025025	
025026	to follow you!”
025027	
025028	said,
025029	
025030	Jesus
025031	the truth,
025032	“I tell you
025033	
025034	no one
025035	there is
025036	who
025037	has left
025038	home
025039	or
025040	brothers
025041	or
025042	sisters
025043	or
025044	mother
025045	or
025046	father
025047	or
025048	children
025049	or
025050	fields
025051	for
025052	my sake
025053	
025054	and for the sake of
025055	
025056	the gospel
025057	who
025058	will not
025059	receive
025060	a hundred times as much –
025061	
025062	in
025063	
025064	this age
025065	
025066	homes,
025067	
025068	brothers,
025069	
025070	sisters,
025071	
025072	mothers,
025073	
025074	children,
025075	
025076	fields,
025077	all with
025078	persecutions –
025079	
025080	and in
025081	
025082	the age
025083	
025084	to come,
025085	life.
025086	eternal
025087	many
025088	But
025089	who are
025090	first
025091	will be last,
025092	
025093	
025094	and the last
025095	first.”
025096	They were
025097	
025098	on
025099	
025100	the way,
025101	going up
025102	to
025103	Jerusalem.
025104	
025105	was
025106	going ahead of them,
025107	
025108	
025109	Jesus
025110	
025111	and they were amazed,
025112	
025113	but
025114	those who followed
025115	were afraid.
025116	
025117	He took
025118	again
025119	
025120	the twelve aside
025121	and began
025122	
025123	to tell them
025124	
025125	what was going
025126	
025127	to happen to him.
025128	
025129	“Look,
025130	we are going up
025131	to
025132	Jerusalem,
025133	
025134	
025135	and the Son
025136	
025137	of Man
025138	will be handed over
025139	
025140	to the chief priests
025141	
025142	
025143	and experts in the law.
025144	
025145	They will condemn him
025146	
025147	to death
025148	
025149	and will turn
025150	him over
025151	
025152	to the Gentiles.
025153	
025154	They will mock him,
025155	
025156	
025157	spit on him,
025158	
025159	
025160	flog
025161	him severely,
025162	
025163	and kill him.
025164	
025165	Yet after
025166	three
025167	days,
025168	he will rise again.”
025169	
025170	came
025171	to him
025172	Then James
025173	
025174	and John,
025175	
025176	the sons
025177	of Zebedee,
025178	and said,
025179	
025180	“Teacher,
025181	we want
025182	
025183	whatever
025184	
025185	we ask.”
025186	
025187	you to do for us
025188	
025189	
025190	
025191	He said to them,
025192	
025193	“What
025194	do you want
025195	me
025196	to do
025197	for you?”
025198	
025199	
025200	They said to him,
025201	
025202	“Permit
025203	
025204	to
025205	one of us
025206	
025207	at
025208	your right hand
025209	
025210	and the other
025211	at
025212	your left
025213	sit
025214	in
025215	
025216	your glory.”
025217	
025218	
025219	But
025220	Jesus
025221	said to them,
025222	
025223	“You don’t
025224	know
025225	what
025226	you are asking!
025227	Are you able
025228	to drink
025229	
025230	the cup
025231	
025232	
025233	I drink
025234	or
025235	
025236	with the baptism
025237	
025238	
025239	be baptized
025240	I experience?”
025241	
025242	
025243	They said
025244	
025245	to him, “We are able.”
025246	
025247	Then
025248	Jesus
025249	said to them,
025250	
025251	
025252	the cup
025253	
025254	
025255	“You will drink
025256	I drink,
025257	
025258	
025259	with the baptism
025260	
025261	
025262	and you will be baptized
025263	I experience,
025264	
025265	but
025266	to sit
025267	at
025268	my right
025269	
025270	or
025271	at
025272	my left
025273	not
025274	is
025275	mine
025276	to give.
025277	
025278	It is for those for whom
025279	it has been prepared.”
025280	Now
025281	heard this,
025282	
025283	when the other ten
025284	they became
025285	angry
025286	with
025287	James
025288	
025289	and John.
025290	
025291	called them
025292	
025293	
025294	Jesus
025295	and said to them,
025296	
025297	“You know
025298	
025299	
025300	that those who are recognized
025301	as rulers
025302	
025303	of the Gentiles
025304	lord it over
025305	them,
025306	
025307	
025308	and those in high positions
025309	use their
025310	authority over them.
025311	
025312	not
025313	this way
025314	But
025315	it is
025316	among you.
025317	
025318	Instead
025319	whoever
025320	
025321	wants
025322	great
025323	to be
025324	among
025325	
025326	you must be
025327	
025328	your servant,
025329	
025330	and whoever
025331	
025332	wants
025333	among
025334	
025335	to be
025336	first
025337	you must be
025338	of all.
025339	the slave
025340	even
025341	For
025342	
025343	the Son
025344	
025345	of Man
025346	did not
025347	come
025348	to be served
025349	but
025350	to serve,
025351	
025352	and to give
025353	
025354	his life
025355	
025356	as a ransom
025357	for
025358	many.”
025359	
025360	They came
025361	to
025362	Jericho.
025363	
025364	were leaving
025365	
025366	
025367	Jericho,
025368	
025369	
025370	As Jesus and his disciples
025371	
025372	
025373	crowd
025374	and a large
025375	
025376	the son
025377	of Timaeus,
025378	Bartimaeus
025379	a blind
025380	beggar,
025381	was sitting
025382	by
025383	
025384	the road.
025385	
025386	When he heard
025387	
025388	Jesus
025389	
025390	the Nazarene,
025391	that it was
025392	he began
025393	
025394	
025395	to shout,
025396	Son
025397	of David,
025398	“Jesus,
025399	have mercy on me!”
025400	
025401	
025402	scolded him
025403	
025404	Many
025405	
025406	to get him to be quiet,
025407	
025408	but
025409	all
025410	the more,
025411	he shouted
025412	“Son
025413	of David,
025414	have mercy on me!”
025415	
025416	
025417	stopped
025418	
025419	Jesus
025420	and said,
025421	“Call him.”
025422	
025423	
025424	So they called
025425	
025426	the blind man
025427	“Have courage!
025428	
025429	and said to him,
025430	Get up!
025431	He is calling you.”
025432	
025433	
025434	
025435	He threw off
025436	
025437	his cloak,
025438	
025439	jumped up,
025440	and came
025441	to
025442	
025443	Jesus.
025444	
025445	said to him,
025446	
025447	
025448	Then Jesus
025449	
025450	“What
025451	
025452	do you want
025453	me to do for you?”
025454	
025455	
025456	The blind man
025457	replied,
025458	
025459	“Rabbi,
025460	
025461	let me see again.”
025462	
025463	
025464	Jesus
025465	said to him,
025466	
025467	“Go,
025468	
025469	your faith
025470	
025471	has healed you.”
025472	
025473	
025474	Immediately
025475	he regained his sight
025476	
025477	and followed him
025478	
025479	on
025480	
025481	the road.
025482	
025483	Now as
025484	they approached
025485	near
025486	Jerusalem,
025487	
025488	Bethphage
025489	
025490	and Bethany,
025491	at
025492	
025493	the Mount
025494	
025495	of Olives,
025496	Jesus sent
025497	two
025498	
025499	of his disciples
025500	
025501	
025502	and said to them,
025503	
025504	“Go
025505	to
025506	
025507	the village
025508	
025509	ahead of you.
025510	
025511	
025512	As soon as
025513	you enter
025514	
025515	
025516	it, you will find
025517	a colt
025518	tied
025519	
025520	there that
025521	
025522	has never
025523	
025524	been ridden.
025525	Untie
025526	
025527	
025528	it and bring it here.
025529	
025530	If
025531	anyone
025532	
025533	says
025534	to you, ‘Why
025535	are you doing this?’
025536	
025537	say,
025538	
025539	‘The Lord
025540	
025541	needs it
025542	
025543	
025544	soon.’”
025545	
025546	and will send it
025547	back
025548	here
025549	
025550	So they went
025551	
025552	and found
025553	a colt
025554	tied
025555	at
025556	a door,
025557	outside
025558	in
025559	
025560	the street,
025561	
025562	and untied it.
025563	
025564	
025565	Some people
025566	
025567	there
025568	standing
025569	said to them,
025570	
025571	“What
025572	are you doing,
025573	untying
025574	
025575	that colt?”
025576	
025577	
025578	They replied
025579	
025580	as
025581	had told them,
025582	
025583	Jesus
025584	
025585	and the bystanders let them go.
025586	
025587	
025588	Then they brought
025589	
025590	the colt
025591	to
025592	
025593	Jesus,
025594	
025595	threw
025596	on it,
025597	
025598	their cloaks
025599	
025600	
025601	and he sat
025602	on it.
025603	
025604	
025605	Many
025606	
025607	their cloaks
025608	
025609	spread
025610	on
025611	
025612	the road
025613	others
025614	and
025615	spread branches
025616	they had cut
025617	in
025618	
025619	the fields.
025620	
025621	
025622	Both those who went ahead
025623	
025624	
025625	and those who followed
025626	kept shouting,
025627	“Hosanna!
025628	Blessed
025629	
025630	is the one who comes
025631	in
025632	the name
025633	of the Lord!
025634	Blessed
025635	
025636	is the coming
025637	kingdom
025638	
025639	of our father
025640	
025641	David!
025642	Hosanna
025643	in
025644	
025645	the highest!”
025646	
025647	Then Jesus entered
025648	and went to
025649	Jerusalem
025650	to
025651	
025652	the temple.
025653	
025654	And after looking around
025655	at everything,
025656	late.
025657	already
025658	since it was
025659	
025660	
025661	he went out
025662	
025663	Bethany
025664	with
025665	
025666	the twelve
025667	
025668	
025669	Now the next day,
025670	as they went out
025671	
025672	from
025673	Bethany,
025674	he was hungry.
025675	
025676	After noticing
025677	a fig tree
025678	in
025679	the distance
025680	with
025681	leaves,
025682	he went
025683	to see if
025684	
025685	any
025686	he could find
025687	fruit on
025688	
025689	
025690	it. When he came
025691	to
025692	
025693	nothing
025694	it he found
025695	
025696	but
025697	leaves,
025698	
025699	for
025700	the season
025701	not
025702	it was
025703	for figs.
025704	
025705	
025706	He said to it,
025707	
025708	again.”
025709	
025710	
025711	ever
025712	from you
025713	
025714	“May no one
025715	fruit
025716	eat
025717	
025718	heard it.
025719	
025720	And his disciples
025721	
025722	
025723	Then they came
025724	to
025725	Jerusalem.
025726	
025727	Jesus entered
025728	
025729	
025730	the temple area
025731	and began
025732	to drive out
025733	
025734	those who were selling
025735	
025736	
025737	and buying
025738	in
025739	
025740	the temple courts.
025741	
025742	
025743	the tables
025744	
025745	of the money changers
025746	
025747	
025748	and the chairs
025749	
025750	of those selling
025751	
025752	doves,
025753	He turned over
025754	
025755	and he would not
025756	permit
025757	
025758	anyone
025759	to carry
025760	merchandise
025761	through
025762	
025763	the temple courts.
025764	
025765	Then he began to teach
025766	
025767	them and said,
025768	
025769	“Is it not
025770	written:
025771	
025772	
025773	‘My house
025774	
025775	a house
025776	of prayer
025777	will be called
025778	for all
025779	
025780	nations’?
025781	
025782	But
025783	you have turned it
025784	
025785	into a den
025786	of robbers!”
025787	
025788	heard
025789	
025790	The chief priests
025791	
025792	
025793	and the experts in the law
025794	
025795	it and they considered
025796	how
025797	
025798	they could assassinate him,
025799	they feared him,
025800	for
025801	
025802	the whole
025803	because
025804	
025805	crowd
025806	was amazed
025807	by
025808	
025809	his teaching.
025810	
025811	
025812	When
025813	evening
025814	came,
025815	Jesus and his disciples went
025816	out of
025817	
025818	the city.
025819	
025820	as they passed by,
025821	In the morning
025822	they saw
025823	
025824	the fig tree
025825	withered
025826	from
025827	the roots.
025828	
025829	remembered
025830	
025831	Peter
025832	and said to him,
025833	
025834	“Rabbi,
025835	look!
025836	
025837	The fig tree
025838	
025839	you cursed
025840	has withered.”
025841	
025842	
025843	
025844	Jesus
025845	said to them,
025846	
025847	“Have
025848	faith
025849	in God.
025850	the truth,
025851	I tell you
025852	
025853	
025854	if someone
025855	
025856	says
025857	
025858	to this mountain,
025859	
025860	‘Be lifted up
025861	
025862	and thrown
025863	into
025864	
025865	the sea,’
025866	
025867	and does not
025868	doubt
025869	in
025870	
025871	his heart
025872	
025873	but
025874	believes
025875	
025876	that what
025877	he says
025878	will happen,
025879	it will be done for him.
025880	
025881	For
025882	
025883	this reason I tell you,
025884	
025885	
025886	whatever
025887	you pray
025888	
025889	and ask for,
025890	believe
025891	
025892	that you have received it,
025893	
025894	and it will be yours.
025895	
025896	
025897	Whenever
025898	you stand
025899	praying,
025900	forgive
025901	if
025902	anything
025903	you have
025904	against
025905	anyone,
025906	him, so that
025907	
025908	
025909	your Father
025910	
025911	
025912	in
025913	
025914	heaven
025915	will also forgive you
025916	
025917	
025918	your sins.”
025919	
025920	
025921	They came
025922	again
025923	to
025924	Jerusalem.
025925	
025926	in
025927	
025928	the temple courts,
025929	While Jesus was walking
025930	
025931	came up
025932	to him
025933	
025934	
025935	the chief priests,
025936	
025937	
025938	the experts in the law,
025939	
025940	
025941	and the elders
025942	
025943	and said,
025944	
025945	“By
025946	what
025947	authority
025948	
025949	are you doing
025950	these things? Or
025951	who
025952	
025953	gave you
025954	
025955	this authority
025956	
025957	to
025958	
025959	do these things?”
025960	
025961	
025962	Jesus
025963	said
025964	
025965	to them, “I will ask you
025966	
025967	one
025968	question.
025969	
025970	Answer me
025971	
025972	
025973	and I will tell you
025974	
025975	by
025976	what
025977	authority
025978	
025979	I do these things:
025980	
025981	baptism –
025982	
025983	John’s
025984	it from
025985	heaven
025986	was
025987	or
025988	from
025989	people?
025990	Answer me.”
025991	
025992	
025993	They discussed
025994	with
025995	one another,
025996	saying,
025997	“If
025998	we say,
025999	‘From
026000	heaven,’
026001	he will say,
026002	‘Then
026003	why
026004	
026005	did you not
026006	believe him?’
026007	
026008	But
026009	if we say,
026010	‘From
026011	people –’”
026012	(they feared
026013	
026014	the crowd,
026015	they all
026016	for
026017	considered
026018	
026019	John
026020	truly
026021	
026022	a prophet).
026023	to be
026024	
026025	So they answered
026026	
026027	Jesus,
026028	said to them,
026029	“We don’t
026030	know.”
026031	
026032	
026033	Then Jesus
026034	will I tell you
026035	
026036	“Neither
026037	
026038	
026039	
026040	by
026041	what
026042	authority
026043	
026044	I am doing these things.”
026045	
026046	Then he began
026047	
026048	in
026049	parables:
026050	to speak to them
026051	a vineyard.
026052	“A man
026053	planted
026054	
026055	He put
026056	a fence around it,
026057	
026058	dug a pit
026059	for its winepress,
026060	
026061	and built
026062	a watchtower.
026063	
026064	Then he leased it
026065	
026066	to tenant farmers
026067	
026068	and went on a journey.
026069	
026070	he sent
026071	to
026072	
026073	the tenants
026074	
026075	At harvest time
026076	a slave
026077	to
026078	from
026079	
026080	them
026081	collect
026082	
026083	
026084	his portion
026085	
026086	of the crop.
026087	
026088	But those tenants seized
026089	
026090	his slave, beat him,
026091	
026092	and sent him away
026093	empty-handed.
026094	
026095	again.
026096	So he sent
026097	to them
026098	
026099	another
026100	slave
026101	This one
026102	they struck on the head
026103	
026104	and treated outrageously.
026105	
026106	another,
026107	He sent
026108	and that one
026109	they killed.
026110	
026111	This happened to many
026112	others,
026113	of whom
026114	some
026115	were beaten,
026116	others
026117	
026118	killed.
026119	left,
026120	one
026121	He had
026122	son.
026123	his one dear
026124	he sent him
026125	
026126	Finally
026127	to them,
026128	
026129	saying,
026130	
026131	‘They will respect
026132	
026133	my son.’
026134	
026135	those
026136	But
026137	
026138	tenants
026139	to
026140	one another,
026141	said
026142	
026143	
026144	‘This is
026145	
026146	the heir.
026147	Come,
026148	let’s kill him
026149	
026150	
026151	
026152	will be ours!’
026153	
026154	and the inheritance
026155	
026156	So they seized
026157	him, killed him,
026158	
026159	
026160	and threw
026161	
026162	his body out of
026163	
026164	the vineyard.
026165	What
026166	then
026167	do?
026168	
026169	will the owner
026170	
026171	of the vineyard
026172	He will come
026173	
026174	and destroy
026175	
026176	those tenants
026177	
026178	and give
026179	
026180	the vineyard
026181	to others.
026182	Have you not
026183	
026184	this scripture:
026185	
026186	read
026187	‘The stone
026188	
026189	rejected
026190	
026191	the builders
026192	
026193	has become
026194	
026195	
026196	the cornerstone.
026197	from
026198	the Lord,
026199	This is
026200	
026201	
026202	and it is
026203	marvelous
026204	in
026205	our eyes’?”
026206	
026207	
026208	Now they wanted
026209	
026210	to arrest him
026211	
026212	(but they feared
026213	
026214	the crowd),
026215	they realized
026216	because
026217	
026218	against them.
026219	
026220	
026221	this parable
026222	that he told
026223	
026224	So they left him
026225	
026226	and went away.
026227	
026228	Then they sent
026229	
026230	
026231	some
026232	
026233	of the Pharisees
026234	
026235	
026236	and Herodians
026237	to
026238	
026239	trap him
026240	with his own words.
026241	
026242	When they came
026243	they said to him,
026244	
026245	“Teacher,
026246	we know
026247	
026248	truthful
026249	that you are
026250	
026251	and do not
026252	court
026253	
026254	
026255	anyone’s
026256	not?
026257	favor, because
026258	you show
026259	
026260	no partiality
026261	
026262	but
026263	in accordance with
026264	the truth.
026265	
026266	the way
026267	
026268	of God
026269	teach
026270	Is it right
026271	to pay
026272	taxes
026273	to Caesar
026274	or
026275	
026276	Should we pay
026277	or
026278	shouldn’t we?”
026279	
026280	
026281	But
026282	he saw
026283	
026284	
026285	through their hypocrisy
026286	and said to them,
026287	
026288	“Why
026289	
026290	are you testing me?
026291	Bring me
026292	
026293	a denarius
026294	
026295	and let me look at it.”
026296	
026297	So
026298	they brought one,
026299	and
026300	he said to them,
026301	
026302	“Whose
026303	
026304	image is this,
026305	
026306	
026307	
026308	and whose inscription?”
026309	
026310	
026311	They replied,
026312	
026313	“Caesar’s.”
026314	
026315	Then
026316	Jesus
026317	said to them,
026318	
026319	
026320	to Caesar
026321	“Give
026322	the things that are Caesar’s,
026323	
026324	
026325	
026326	and to God
026327	
026328	the things that are God’s.”
026329	
026330	And they were utterly amazed
026331	at him.
026332	
026333	
026334	also came
026335	Sadducees
026336	to him
026337	
026338	(who
026339	say
026340	resurrection)
026341	no
026342	there is
026343	
026344	and asked him,
026345	
026346	
026347	“Teacher,
026348	Moses
026349	wrote for us:
026350	
026351	
026352	‘If
026353	
026354	a man’s brother
026355	dies
026356	
026357	and leaves
026358	a wife
026359	
026360	but no
026361	
026362	children,
026363	that
026364	must marry
026365	
026366	man
026367	
026368	
026369	the widow
026370	
026371	and father
026372	children
026373	
026374	for his brother.’
026375	
026376	seven
026377	brothers.
026378	There were
026379	
026380	
026381	The first one
026382	
026383	married,
026384	
026385	and when he died
026386	no
026387	he had
026388	children.
026389	
026390	
026391	The second
026392	married her
026393	
026394	
026395	and died
026396	without
026397	
026398	any children,
026399	
026400	
026401	the third.
026402	and likewise
026403	
026404	
026405	of the seven
026406	None
026407	had
026408	children.
026409	Finally,
026410	
026411	
026412	
026413	the woman
026414	died too.
026415	In
026416	
026417	the resurrection,
026418	when
026419	they rise
026420	again, whose
026421	
026422	will she be?
026423	wife
026424	
026425	For
026426	all seven
026427	had
026428	
026429	married her.”
026430	said to them,
026431	
026432	
026433	Jesus
026434	“Aren’t
026435	for
026436	
026437	you deceived
026438	this reason, because you don’t
026439	know
026440	
026441	the scriptures
026442	or
026443	
026444	the power
026445	
026446	of God?
026447	when
026448	For
026449	from
026450	the dead,
026451	they rise
026452	they neither
026453	marry
026454	nor
026455	are given in marriage,
026456	but
026457	are
026458	like
026459	angels
026460	in
026461	
026462	heaven.
026463	as for
026464	Now
026465	
026466	the dead
026467	
026468	being raised,
026469	have you not
026470	read
026471	in
026472	
026473	the book
026474	of Moses,
026475	in
026476	the
026477	passage about the bush,
026478	how
026479	
026480	
026481	
026482	God
026483	said to him,
026484	
026485	
026486	‘I am the God
026487	of Abraham,
026488	
026489	
026490	the God
026491	of Isaac,
026492	
026493	
026494	and the God
026495	of Jacob’?
026496	not
026497	He is
026498	the God
026499	of the dead
026500	but
026501	of the living.
026502	You are badly
026503	mistaken!”
026504	
026505	came
026506	Now one
026507	
026508	of the experts in the law
026509	and heard them
026510	
026511	debating.
026512	When he saw
026513	
026514	well,
026515	that Jesus answered them
026516	
026517	he asked him,
026518	
026519	“Which
026520	is
026521	commandment
026522	the most important
026523	of all?”
026524	answered,
026525	
026526	Jesus
026527	
026528	“The most important
026529	is:
026530	‘Listen,
026531	Israel,
026532	the Lord
026533	
026534	our God,
026535	
026536	the Lord
026537	one.
026538	is
026539	
026540	Love
026541	the Lord
026542	
026543	your God
026544	
026545	with
026546	all
026547	
026548	your heart,
026549	
026550	
026551	with
026552	all
026553	
026554	your soul,
026555	
026556	
026557	with
026558	all
026559	
026560	your mind,
026561	
026562	
026563	and with
026564	all
026565	
026566	your strength.’
026567	
026568	The second
026569	is:
026570	‘Love
026571	
026572	your neighbor
026573	
026574	as
026575	yourself.’
026576	greater than these.”
026577	
026578	other
026579	commandment
026580	no
026581	There is
026582	
026583	said to him,
026584	
026585	
026586	The expert in the law
026587	you are right
026588	Teacher;
026589	“That is
026590	true,
026591	to say
026592	
026593	one,
026594	that he is
026595	
026596	no
026597	and there is
026598	one else
026599	besides him.
026600	
026601	
026602	
026603	And to love him
026604	
026605	with
026606	all
026607	
026608	your heart,
026609	
026610	with
026611	all
026612	
026613	your mind,
026614	
026615	and with
026616	all
026617	
026618	your strength
026619	
026620	
026621	and to love
026622	
026623	your neighbor
026624	as
026625	yourself
026626	more important
026627	is
026628	than all
026629	
026630	burnt offerings
026631	
026632	and sacrifices.”
026633	
026634	
026635	When Jesus
026636	saw
026637	
026638	
026639	thoughtfully,
026640	that he had answered
026641	he said to him,
026642	
026643	not
026644	far
026645	“You are
026646	from
026647	
026648	the kingdom
026649	
026650	of God.”
026651	
026652	Then no one
026653	any longer
026654	dared
026655	
026656	to question him.
026657	
026658	
026659	
026660	While Jesus
026661	he said,
026662	was teaching
026663	in
026664	the
026665	temple courts,
026666	“How
026667	say
026668	
026669	is it that the experts in the law
026670	
026671	
026672	that the Christ
026673	son?
026674	David’s
026675	is
026676	
026677	David himself,
026678	said,
026679	by
026680	
026681	Spirit,
026682	
026683	the Holy
026684	said
026685	‘The Lord
026686	
026687	to my lord,
026688	
026689	“Sit
026690	at
026691	my right hand,
026692	
026693	until
026694	
026695	I put
026696	
026697	your enemies
026698	
026699	under
026700	
026701	your feet.”’
026702	
026703	
026704	If David himself
026705	calls him
026706	
026707	‘Lord,’
026708	
026709	how
026710	
026711	can he be
026712	his son?”
026713	
026714	
026715	And the large
026716	crowd
026717	was listening to him
026718	
026719	with delight.
026720	
026721	In
026722	
026723	his teaching
026724	
026725	Jesus also said,
026726	“Watch out
026727	for
026728	
026729	the experts in the law.
026730	
026731	They like
026732	in
026733	long robes
026734	walking around
026735	
026736	and elaborate greetings
026737	in
026738	
026739	the marketplaces,
026740	
026741	and the best seats
026742	in
026743	
026744	the synagogues
026745	
026746	and the places of honor
026747	at
026748	
026749	banquets.
026750	
026751	They devour
026752	
026753	property,
026754	
026755	widows’
026756	
026757	and as a show
026758	make long
026759	prayers.
026760	
026761	These men will receive
026762	a more severe
026763	punishment.”
026764	
026765	Then he sat down
026766	opposite
026767	
026768	the offering box,
026769	and watched
026770	
026771	
026772	the crowd
026773	putting
026774	coins
026775	into
026776	
026777	it.
026778	
026779	Many
026780	rich people
026781	were throwing
026782	in large amounts.
026783	
026784	came
026785	And a
026786	widow
026787	poor
026788	and put in
026789	small copper coins,
026790	two
026791	
026792	worth
026793	less than a penny.
026794	
026795	He called
026796	
026797	his disciples
026798	
026799	“I tell you
026800	
026801	the truth,
026802	and said to them,
026803	
026804	
026805	
026806	widow
026807	
026808	
026809	this poor
026810	more
026811	than all the others.
026812	has put
026813	
026814	
026815	into
026816	
026817	the offering box
026818	they all
026819	For
026820	out of
026821	
026822	their wealth.
026823	
026824	gave
026825	
026826	But
026827	she, out of
026828	
026829	her poverty,
026830	
026831	everything
026832	
026833	she had
026834	put in
026835	what
026836	
026837	to live on,
026838	she had.”
026839	
026840	Now as
026841	
026842	Jesus was going out of
026843	
026844	the temple courts,
026845	said to him,
026846	
026847	one
026848	
026849	of his disciples
026850	
026851	“Teacher,
026852	look at
026853	these tremendous
026854	stones
026855	
026856	
026857	and buildings!”
026858	
026859	
026860	Jesus
026861	said to him,
026862	
026863	“Do you see
026864	
026865	
026866	these great
026867	buildings?
026868	
026869	Not
026870	will be left
026871	
026872	one stone
026873	on
026874	another.
026875	
026876	
026877	
026878	All will be torn down!”
026879	
026880	So while he was sitting
026881	
026882	on
026883	
026884	the Mount
026885	
026886	of Olives
026887	opposite
026888	
026889	the temple,
026890	asked him
026891	
026892	
026893	privately,
026894	Peter,
026895	
026896	James,
026897	
026898	John,
026899	
026900	and Andrew
026901	“Tell us,
026902	
026903	when
026904	
026905	will these things happen?
026906	
026907	And what
026908	
026909	will be the sign
026910	that
026911	these things are about
026912	
026913	to take place?”
026914	all
026915	
026916	
026917	Jesus
026918	began
026919	to say to them,
026920	
026921	“Watch out
026922	that no
026923	one
026924	
026925	misleads you.
026926	Many
026927	will come
026928	in
026929	
026930	my name,
026931	
026932	saying,
026933	
026934	
026935	‘I am
026936	
026937	many.
026938	he,’ and they will mislead
026939	When
026940	
026941	you hear
026942	of wars
026943	
026944	and rumors
026945	of wars,
026946	do not
026947	be alarmed.
026948	These things must
026949	happen,
026950	but
026951	is still to come.
026952	
026953	the end
026954	will rise up
026955	For
026956	nation
026957	in arms against
026958	nation,
026959	
026960	and kingdom
026961	against
026962	kingdom.
026963	There will be
026964	earthquakes
026965	in various
026966	places,
026967	and there will be
026968	famines.
026969	These are but the beginning
026970	of birth pains.
026971	
026972	“You must watch out
026973	
026974	
026975	for yourselves.
026976	You will be handed over
026977	
026978	to
026979	councils
026980	
026981	in
026982	the synagogues.
026983	and beaten
026984	
026985	before
026986	governors

026988	and kings
026989	You will stand
026990	because of me,
026991	
026992	as
026993	a witness
026994	to them.
026995	
026996	to
026997	all
026998	
026999	nations.
027000	First
027001	must
027002	be preached
027003	
027004	the gospel
027005	
027006	When
027007	they arrest
027008	
027009	you and hand you over for trial,
027010	do not
027011	worry
027012	about what
027013	to speak.
027014	But
027015	say whatever
027016	
027017	is given you
027018	
027019	at
027020	that
027021	
027022	time,
027023	
027024	
027025	not
027026	for
027027	it is
027028	
027029	
027030	you speaking,
027031	but
027032	
027033	Spirit.
027034	
027035	the Holy
027036	
027037	will hand over
027038	Brother
027039	brother
027040	to
027041	death,
027042	
027043	and a father
027044	his child.
027045	
027046	will rise
027047	Children
027048	against
027049	parents
027050	
027051	and have them put to death.
027052	
027053	
027054	You will be
027055	hated
027056	by
027057	everyone
027058	because of
027059	
027060	my name.
027061	
027062	
027063	But
027064	the one who endures
027065	to
027066	the end
027067	
027068	will be saved.
027069	when
027070	“But
027071	you see
027072	
027073	the abomination
027074	
027075	of desolation

027077	where
027078	not be”
027079	it should

027093	
027094	The one on

027134	Pray
027135	
027136	that
027137	it may not
027138	be
027139	in winter.

027143	days

027179	the elect,

027194	is the Christ!’
027195	or ‘Look,

027213	possible,
027214	
027215	the elect.
027216	
027217	
027218	Be careful!
027219	I have told you
027220	
027221	everything ahead of time.
027222	“But
027223	in
027224	those
027225	
027226	days,

027229	suffering,
027230	that
027231	
027232	the sun
027233	will be darkened
027234	
027235	
027236	and the moon

027240	its light;

027242	
027243	
027244	the stars

027254	in
027255	
027256	the heavens
027257	will be shaken.
027258	
027259	Then
027260	everyone will see
027261	
027262	the Son
027263	
027264	of Man
027265	arriving
027266	in
027267	the clouds
027268	with
027269	power
027270	great
027271	
027272	and glory.
027273	
027274	Then
027275	he will send
027276	
027277	angels

027289	of the earth
027290	to

027292	of heaven.
027293	from
027294	
027295	
027296	the fig tree:
027297	“Learn
027298	
027299	this parable
027300	Whenever
027301	
027302	
027303	its branch
027304	
027305	tender

027313	near.
027314	
027315	that summer
027316	is
027317	So
027318	
027319	
027320	also you, when

027323	these things happening,

027325	
027326	near,
027327	that he is
027328	right at
027329	the door.
027330	the truth,
027331	I tell you
027332	
027333	
027334	
027335	will not
027336	pass away
027337	
027338	this generation

027340	until
027341	
027342	
027343	all
027344	these things take place.
027345	
027346	Heaven
027347	
027348	
027349	and earth
027350	will pass away,
027351	
027352	but
027353	my words
027354	
027355	
027356	will never
027357	pass away.
027358	as for
027359	“But
027360	
027361	day
027362	that
027363	or
027364	
027365	hour
027366	no one
027367	knows
027368	it – neither
027369	
027370	the angels
027371	in
027372	heaven,
027373	nor
027374	
027375	the Son –
027376	
027377	except
027378	
027379	the Father.
027380	Watch out!
027381	Stay alert!
027382	you do not
027383	know
027384	For
027385	when
027386	
027387	the time
027388	will come.
027389	It is like
027390	a man
027391	going on a journey.
027392	He left
027393	
027394	his house
027395	
027396	
027397	and put
027398	
027399	his slaves
027400	
027401	
027402	in charge,
027403	assigning to each
027404	
027405	his work,
027406	
027407	
027408	
027409	the doorkeeper
027410	and commanded
027411	to
027412	stay alert.
027413	Stay alert,
027414	then,
027415	you do not
027416	know
027417	because
027418	when
027419	
027420	the owner
027421	
027422	of the house
027423	will return –
027424	whether
027425	during evening,
027426	
027427	at midnight,
027428	
027429	when the rooster crows,
027430	or
027431	at dawn –
027432	or else
027433	when he returns
027434	suddenly.
027435	he might find
027436	
027437	you asleep
027438	What
027439	
027440	
027441	I say
027442	to everyone:
027443	to you I say
027444	Stay alert!”
027445	
027446	
027447	
027448	before the Passover
027449	
027450	
027451	and the Feast of Unleavened Bread,
027452	
027453	Two
027454	days
027455	
027456	were trying to find
027457	
027458	the chief priests
027459	
027460	
027461	and the experts in the law
027462	a way
027463	
027464	Jesus by
027465	stealth
027466	to arrest
027467	and kill him.
027468	they said,
027469	For
027470	“Not
027471	during
027472	
027473	the feast,
027474	so there won’t
027475	be
027476	a riot
027477	
027478	among the people.”
027479	
027480	Now while Jesus was
027481	
027482	in
027483	Bethany
027484	at
027485	
027486	the house
027487	of Simon
027488	
027489	the leper,
027490	reclining at the table,
027491	
027492	came
027493	a woman
027494	with
027495	an alabaster jar
027496	aromatic oil
027497	nard.
027498	from pure
027499	of costly
027500	After breaking open
027501	
027502	the jar,
027503	she poured it on
027504	
027505	
027506	his head.
027507	who were
027508	But
027509	some
027510	present indignantly
027511	said to
027512	one another,
027513	
027514	“Why
027515	
027516	this waste
027517	
027518	
027519	of expensive ointment?
027520	
027521	It could
027522	
027523	
027524	
027525	
027526	have been sold
027527	for more than
027528	silver coins
027529	three hundred
027530	
027531	and the money given
027532	
027533	to the poor!”
027534	
027535	So they spoke angrily to her.
027536	
027537	
027538	But
027539	Jesus
027540	said,
027541	“Leave her
027542	
027543	alone. Why
027544	
027545	are you bothering her?
027546	
027547	a good
027548	service
027549	She has done
027550	for me.
027551	
027552	you will always
027553	For
027554	
027555	the poor
027556	have
027557	with
027558	you,
027559	
027560	whenever
027561	you want.
027562	and you can
027563	
027564	good for them
027565	do
027566	
027567	But
027568	you will not
027569	always
027570	have me!
027571	what
027572	she could.
027573	She did
027574	beforehand
027575	She anointed
027576	
027577	my body
027578	
027579	for
027580	
027581	burial.
027582	the truth,
027583	
027584	I tell you
027585	
027586	wherever
027587	
027588	is proclaimed
027589	
027590	the gospel
027591	in
027592	the whole
027593	
027594	world,
027595	
027596	what
027597	she has done
027598	
027599	will also be told
027600	in
027601	memory of her.”
027602	
027603	
027604	Then Judas
027605	Iscariot,
027606	
027607	one
027608	
027609	of the twelve,
027610	went
027611	to
027612	
027613	the chief priests
027614	to
027615	Jesus
027616	betray
027617	into their hands.
027618	
027619	
027620	When they heard
027621	this, they were delighted
027622	
027623	and promised
027624	
027625	money.
027626	to give him
027627	
027628	So Judas began looking for
027629	
027630	
027631	an opportunity
027632	to betray him.
027633	
027634	
027635	Now on the first
027636	day
027637	
027638	of the feast of Unleavened Bread,
027639	when
027640	
027641	the Passover lamb
027642	is sacrificed,
027643	said to him,
027644	
027645	
027646	Jesus’ disciples
027647	
027648	“Where
027649	do you want
027650	
027651	us to prepare
027652	for you to
027653	eat
027654	
027655	the Passover?”
027656	
027657	He sent
027658	two
027659	
027660	of his disciples
027661	
027662	
027663	and told them,
027664	
027665	“Go
027666	into
027667	
027668	the city,
027669	
027670	will meet you.
027671	
027672	and a man
027673	a jar
027674	of water
027675	carrying
027676	Follow him.
027677	
027678	
027679	Wherever
027680	
027681	he enters,
027682	tell
027683	
027684	the owner of the house,
027685	
027686	
027687	‘The Teacher
027688	“Where
027689	says,
027690	is
027691	
027692	my guest room

027694	where
027695	
027696	the Passover
027697	with
027698	
027699	my disciples?”’
027700	
027701	I may eat
027702	
027703	
027704	
027705	He will show you
027706	room upstairs,
027707	a large
027708	furnished
027709	and ready.
027710	
027711	there.”
027712	Make preparations for us
027713	
027714	
027715	left,
027716	
027717	So the disciples
027718	
027719	went
027720	into
027721	
027722	the city,
027723	
027724	and found
027725	things just as
027726	he had told them,
027727	
027728	
027729	and they prepared
027730	
027731	the Passover.
027732	
027733	evening,
027734	Then, when it was
027735	he came
027736	to the house with
027737	
027738	the twelve.
027739	
027740	While they were at the table
027741	
027742	
027743	eating,
027744	
027745	Jesus
027746	“I tell you
027747	the truth,
027748	said,
027749	
027750	
027751	one
027752	of
027753	
027754	will betray me.”
027755	
027756	
027757	you eating
027758	with me
027759	
027760	They were distressed,
027761	
027762	
027763	said to him,
027764	
027765	and one
027766	by
027767	one
027768	“Surely not I?”
027769	
027770	
027771	
027772	He said to them,
027773	
027774	“It is one
027775	
027776	of the twelve,
027777	
027778	one who dips
027779	his hand with me
027780	
027781	into
027782	
027783	the bowl.
027784	
027785	
027786	
027787	For the Son
027788	
027789	of Man
027790	will go
027791	as
027792	it is written
027793	about him,
027794	
027795	woe
027796	but
027797	
027798	man
027799	to that
027800	by
027801	whom
027802	
027803	the Son
027804	
027805	of Man
027806	is betrayed!
027807	It would be better for him
027808	
027809	if
027810	he had never
027811	been born.”
027812	
027813	
027814	
027815	
027816	While they were eating,
027817	
027818	he took
027819	bread,
027820	and after giving thanks
027821	he broke
027822	
027823	it, gave it to them,
027824	
027825	
027826	and said,
027827	“Take
027828	
027829	it. This is
027830	
027831	my body.”
027832	
027833	
027834	And after taking
027835	the cup
027836	and giving thanks,
027837	he gave it to them,
027838	
027839	
027840	drank
027841	from it.
027842	
027843	and they all
027844	
027845	He said to them,
027846	
027847	
027848	“This is
027849	
027850	my blood,
027851	
027852	
027853	the blood of the covenant,
027854	
027855	that is poured out
027856	for
027857	many.
027858	the truth,
027859	I tell you
027860	
027861	
027862	I will no longer
027863	
027864	
027865	drink
027866	of
027867	
027868	the fruit
027869	
027870	of the vine
027871	until
027872	
027873	day
027874	that
027875	when
027876	
027877	I drink it
027878	new
027879	in
027880	
027881	the kingdom
027882	
027883	of God.”
027884	
027885	After singing a hymn,
027886	they went out
027887	to
027888	
027889	the Mount
027890	
027891	of Olives.
027892	
027893	said to them,
027894	
027895	
027896	Then Jesus
027897	
027898	“You will all
027899	fall away,
027900	
027901	for it is written,
027902	‘I will strike
027903	
027904	the shepherd,
027905	
027906	
027907	and the sheep
027908	will be scattered.’
027909	But
027910	after
027911	
027912	I am raised,
027913	
027914	I will go ahead of you
027915	
027916	into
027917	
027918	Galilee.”
027919	
027920	
027921	Peter
027922	said to him,
027923	
027924	“Even if
027925	
027926	they all
027927	fall away,
027928	
027929	I will not!”
027930	
027931	
027932	said to him,
027933	
027934	
027935	Jesus
027936	the truth,
027937	“I tell you
027938	
027939	
027940	
027941	today –
027942	
027943	
027944	this very night –
027945	before
027946	
027947	twice,
027948	a rooster
027949	crows
027950	three times.”
027951	
027952	you will deny me
027953	
027954	But
027955	emphatically,
027956	Peter insisted
027957	“Even if
027958	I must
027959	
027960	die with you,
027961	
027962	
027963	I will never
027964	
027965	deny you.”
027966	the same thing.
027967	And
027968	
027969	all of them
027970	said
027971	
027972	Then they went
027973	to
027974	a place
027975	
027976	
027977	called
027978	Gethsemane,
027979	
027980	and Jesus said
027981	
027982	to his disciples,
027983	
027984	“Sit
027985	here
027986	while
027987	I pray.”
027988	
027989	He took
027990	
027991	Peter,
027992	
027993	
027994	James,
027995	
027996	
027997	and John
027998	with him,
027999	
028000	
028001	and became
028002	very troubled
028003	
028004	and distressed.
028005	
028006	He said to them,
028007	
028008	deeply grieved,
028009	is
028010	
028011	“My soul
028012	
028013	even to the point
028014	of death.
028015	Remain
028016	here
028017	
028018	and stay alert.”
028019	
028020	Going
028021	a little
028022	farther, he threw
028023	himself to
028024	
028025	the ground
028026	
028027	and prayed
028028	that
028029	if
028030	possible
028031	it were
028032	would pass
028033	from him.
028034	
028035	
028036	the hour
028037	
028038	He said,
028039	“Abba,
028040	
028041	Father,
028042	all things
028043	are possible for you.
028044	
028045	Take
028046	
028047	this cup away
028048	
028049	from me.
028050	
028051	Yet
028052	not
028053	what
028054	
028055	I will,
028056	but
028057	what you will.”
028058	
028059	
028060	Then he came
028061	
028062	and found them
028063	
028064	sleeping,
028065	
028066	and said
028067	
028068	to Peter,
028069	“Simon,
028070	are you sleeping?
028071	
028072	Couldn’t you
028073	for one
028074	hour?
028075	stay awake
028076	Stay awake
028077	
028078	and pray
028079	that
028080	you will not
028081	fall
028082	into
028083	temptation.
028084	
028085	
028086	The spirit
028087	is willing,
028088	
028089	but
028090	the flesh
028091	is weak.”
028092	
028093	again
028094	He went away
028095	and prayed
028096	
028097	
028098	the same thing.
028099	
028100	
028101	again
028102	When he came
028103	he found them
028104	
028105	sleeping;
028106	
028107	
028108	
028109	
028110	their eyes open.
028111	they could not keep
028112	
028113	not know
028114	And they did
028115	what
028116	to tell him.
028117	
028118	
028119	He came
028120	
028121	a third time
028122	
028123	and said to them,
028124	
028125	sleeping
028126	
028127	“Are you still
028128	
028129	and resting?
028130	Enough of that!
028131	has come.
028132	
028133	The hour
028134	Look,
028135	is betrayed
028136	
028137	the Son
028138	
028139	of Man
028140	into
028141	
028142	the hands
028143	
028144	of sinners.
028145	Get up,
028146	let us go.
028147	Look!
028148	
028149	My betrayer
028150	
028151	is approaching!”
028152	
028153	Right away,
028154	while Jesus was still
028155	
028156	speaking,
028157	arrived.
028158	Judas,
028159	one
028160	
028161	of the twelve,
028162	
028163	With him
028164	
028165	came a crowd
028166	armed with
028167	swords
028168	
028169	and clubs,
028170	sent by
028171	
028172	the chief priests
028173	
028174	
028175	and experts in the law
028176	
028177	
028178	and elders.
028179	had given them
028180	(Now
028181	
028182	the betrayer
028183	
028184	a sign,
028185	
028186	saying,
028187	“The one
028188	
028189	I kiss
028190	
028191	is
028192	the man. Arrest him
028193	
028194	
028195	and lead him away
028196	under guard.”)
028197	
028198	When Judas arrived,
028199	to Jesus immediately
028200	he went up
028201	
028202	and said,
028203	“Rabbi!”
028204	
028205	and kissed him.
028206	
028207	
028208	
028209	Then they took
028210	
028211	hold of him
028212	
028213	
028214	and arrested him.
028215	
028216	One
028217	
028218	
028219	
028220	of the bystanders
028221	drew
028222	
028223	his sword
028224	and struck
028225	
028226	slave,
028227	
028228	the high priest’s
028229	
028230	cutting off
028231	his
028232	
028233	ear.
028234	
028235	said to them,
028236	
028237	Jesus
028238	
028239	
028240	like
028241	
028242	you would an outlaw?
028243	“Have you come
028244	with
028245	swords
028246	
028247	and clubs
028248	to arrest me
028249	
028250	Day after
028251	day
028252	I was
028253	with you,
028254	
028255	in
028256	
028257	the temple courts,
028258	teaching
028259	
028260	yet you did not
028261	arrest me.
028262	
028263	But
028264	this has happened so that
028265	would be fulfilled.”
028266	
028267	the scriptures
028268	
028269	the disciples left him
028270	
028271	and fled.
028272	Then all
028273	
028274	A young man
028275	
028276	was following him,
028277	
028278	wearing
028279	only a linen cloth.
028280	
028281	
028282	
028283	They tried to arrest him,
028284	
028285	
028286	but
028287	leaving
028288	
028289	his linen cloth behind.
028290	naked,
028291	he ran off
028292	
028293	Then they led
028294	
028295	Jesus
028296	to
028297	
028298	the high priest,
028299	
028300	came together.
028301	and all
028302	
028303	the chief priests
028304	
028305	
028306	and elders
028307	
028308	
028309	and experts in the law
028310	
028311	
028312	And Peter
028313	from
028314	a distance,
028315	had followed him
028316	
028317	up to
028318	
028319	
028320	
028321	courtyard.
028322	
028323	the high priest’s
028324	
028325	He was
028326	sitting
028327	with
028328	
028329	the guards
028330	
028331	and warming
028332	himself by
028333	
028334	the fire.
028335	
028336	
028337	The chief priests
028338	
028339	and the whole
028340	
028341	Sanhedrin
028342	were looking for
028343	against
028344	
028345	Jesus
028346	evidence
028347	so that
028348	
028349	they could put
028350	him to death,
028351	
028352	but they did not
028353	find anything.
028354	Many
028355	
028356	gave false testimony
028357	against him,
028358	
028359	
028360	agree.
028361	
028362	testimony
028363	did not
028364	but their
028365	
028366	Some
028367	stood up
028368	and gave this false testimony
028369	against him:
028370	
028371	
028372	
028373	
028374	“We heard him
028375	
028376	say,
028377	
028378	
028379	‘I will destroy
028380	
028381	this temple
028382	
028383	
028384	made with hands
028385	
028386	and in
028387	three
028388	days
028389	another
028390	not made with hands.’”
028391	build
028392	
028393	Yet even
028394	on this point
028395	did not agree.
028396	
028397	
028398	their testimony
028399	
028400	
028401	stood up
028402	
028403	Then the high priest
028404	before
028405	
028406	them and asked
028407	
028408	Jesus, “Have you
028409	
028410	no
028411	answer?
028412	
028413	What
028414	
028415	
028416	is this that they are testifying against you?”
028417	
028418	But
028419	he was silent
028420	
028421	and did not
028422	answer.
028423	
028424	Again
028425	
028426	the high priest
028427	questioned him,
028428	
028429	
028430	
028431	
028432	
028433	“Are you
028434	
028435	the Christ,
028436	
028437	the Son
028438	
028439	of the Blessed One?”
028440	
028441	
028442	Jesus,
028443	said
028444	
028445	“I am,”
028446	
028447	“and you will see
028448	
028449	the Son
028450	
028451	of Man
028452	at
028453	the right hand
028454	sitting
028455	
028456	of the Power
028457	
028458	and coming
028459	with
028460	
028461	the clouds
028462	
028463	of heaven.”
028464	
028465	Then
028466	the high priest
028467	tore
028468	
028469	his clothes
028470	
028471	and said,
028472	“Why
028473	still
028474	need
028475	do we
028476	witnesses?
028477	You have heard
028478	
028479	the blasphemy!
028480	What
028481	
028482	is your verdict?”
028483	
028484	
028485	They all
028486	condemned him
028487	
028488	deserving
028489	as
028490	death.
028491	
028492	began
028493	Then some
028494	to spit on him,
028495	
028496	
028497	and to blindfold him,
028498	
028499	
028500	
028501	
028502	and to strike
028503	him with their fists,
028504	
028505	saying,
028506	
028507	“Prophesy!”
028508	
028509	
028510	The guards
028511	and beat him.
028512	
028513	also took him
028514	
028515	was
028516	
028517	Now while Peter
028518	below
028519	in
028520	
028521	the courtyard,
028522	came by.
028523	one
028524	
028525	slave girls
028526	
028527	of the high priest’s
028528	
028529	When she saw
028530	
028531	Peter
028532	warming
028533	himself, she looked directly at him
028534	
028535	and said,
028536	
028537	
028538	with
028539	
028540	that Nazarene,
028541	“You also were
028542	
028543	Jesus.”
028544	
028545	But
028546	he denied it:
028547	
028548	
028549	
028550	“I don’t even
028551	understand
028552	
028553	what
028554	you’re talking
028555	
028556	about!” Then he went
028557	out
028558	to
028559	
028560	the gateway,
028561	
028562	and a rooster
028563	crowed.
028564	
028565	
028566	When the slave girl
028567	saw him,
028568	
028569	she began
028570	again
028571	to say
028572	
028573	to the bystanders,
028574	
028575	
028576	one of them.”
028577	
028578	“This man is
028579	
028580	But
028581	it again.
028582	he denied
028583	
028584	later
028585	A short time
028586	again
028587	
028588	the bystanders
028589	said
028590	
028591	to Peter,
028592	“You must
028593	be one of them,
028594	
028595	you are
028596	
028597	because
028598	also a Galilean.”
028599	
028600	
028601	Then
028602	he began
028603	to curse,
028604	
028605	and he swore with an oath,
028606	
028607	“I do not
028608	know
028609	
028610	this man
028611	
028612	
028613	you are talking about!”
028614	
028615	Immediately
028616	
028617	a second time.
028618	a rooster
028619	crowed
028620	
028621	remembered
028622	
028623	Then Peter
028624	
028625	what
028626	
028627	had said to him:
028628	
028629	
028630	Jesus
028631	
028632	“Before
028633	a rooster
028634	crows
028635	twice,
028636	three times.”
028637	
028638	you will deny me
028639	
028640	And he broke down
028641	and wept.
028642	
028643	Early
028644	in the morning,
028645	a plan,
028646	after forming
028647	
028648	the chief priests
028649	with
028650	
028651	the elders
028652	
028653	and the experts in the law
028654	
028655	and the whole
028656	
028657	Sanhedrin
028658	tied
028659	
028660	Jesus up,
028661	led him away,
028662	
028663	and handed him over
028664	to Pilate.
028665	
028666	asked him,
028667	
028668	
028669	So Pilate
028670	
028671	“Are you
028672	
028673	the king
028674	
028675	of the Jews?”
028676	
028677	
028678	He replied,
028679	
028680	“You say so.”
028681	
028682	
028683	
028684	began to accuse him
028685	
028686	
028687	Then the chief priests
028688	repeatedly.
028689	
028690	So
028691	Pilate
028692	again,
028693	asked him
028694	
028695	
028696	“Have you nothing
028697	to say?
028698	
028699	See
028700	how many
028701	
028702	charges they are bringing against you!”
028703	
028704	But
028705	Jesus
028706	made no further
028707	
028708	reply,
028709	so that
028710	was amazed.
028711	
028712	Pilate
028713	During
028714	
028715	the feast
028716	it was customary to release
028717	
028718	one
028719	prisoner
028720	to the people, whomever
028721	they requested.
028722	was
028723	
028724	
028725	A man named
028726	Barabbas
028727	with
028728	
028729	rebels
028730	imprisoned
028731	who
028732	during
028733	
028734	an insurrection.
028735	murder
028736	had committed
028737	Then
028738	came up
028739	the
028740	crowd
028741	and began
028742	to ask Pilate to release a prisoner
028743	as
028744	was his custom.
028745	for them,
028746	
028747	So
028748	Pilate
028749	asked them,
028750	
028751	
028752	“Do you want
028753	me to release
028754	
028755	
028756	the king
028757	
028758	of the Jews for you?”
028759	he knew
028760	(For
028761	
028762	because of
028763	envy.)
028764	had handed
028765	him over
028766	
028767	that the chief priests
028768	
028769	But
028770	the chief priests
028771	stirred up
028772	
028773	the crowd
028774	to have him
028775	instead.
028776	
028777	Barabbas
028778	release
028779	
028780	
028781	So
028782	Pilate
028783	again,
028784	spoke to them
028785	you call
028786	
028787	what
028788	“Then
028789	do you want
028790	me to do
028791	with the one
028792	
028793	
028794	king
028795	
028796	of the Jews?”
028797	
028798	
028799	back,
028800	They shouted
028801	“Crucify him!”
028802	
028803	
028804	
028805	Pilate
028806	asked them,
028807	
028808	“Why? What
028809	
028810	has he done
028811	wrong?”
028812	
028813	But
028814	more insistently,
028815	they shouted
028816	“Crucify him!”
028817	
028818	
028819	
028820	Pilate
028821	Because he wanted
028822	
028823	the crowd,
028824	
028825	
028826	to satisfy
028827	released
028828	
028829	
028830	Barabbas for them.
028831	
028832	he handed him over
028833	
028834	Then, after he had Jesus
028835	flogged,
028836	to
028837	be crucified.
028838	
028839	So
028840	the soldiers
028841	led him
028842	
028843	into
028844	
028845	the palace
028846	(that
028847	is,
028848	the governor’s residence)
028849	
028850	and called together
028851	the whole
028852	
028853	cohort.
028854	
028855	They put
028856	on him
028857	a purple cloak
028858	
028859	they put it on him.
028860	
028861	and after braiding
028862	of thorns,
028863	a crown
028864	
028865	They began
028866	to salute him:
028867	
028868	“Hail,
028869	king
028870	
028871	of the Jews!”
028872	
028873	Again and again they struck him
028874	
028875	
028876	on the head
028877	with a staff
028878	
028879	and spit on him.
028880	
028881	
028882	
028883	
028884	Then they knelt down
028885	and paid homage to him.
028886	
028887	
028888	When
028889	they had finished mocking him,
028890	
028891	they stripped him
028892	
028893	
028894	of the purple cloak
028895	
028896	and put
028897	back on him.
028898	
028899	his own clothes
028900	
028901	
028902	Then they led
028903	him away
028904	to
028905	crucify him.
028906	
028907	
028908	The soldiers forced
028909	a passerby
028910	
028911	Simon
028912	of Cyrene,
028913	who was coming
028914	in from
028915	the country
028916	
028917	(he was the father
028918	of Alexander
028919	
028920	and Rufus).
028921	
028922	to carry
028923	
028924	his cross,
028925	
028926	
028927	They brought
028928	
028929	Jesus to
028930	
028931	called Golgotha
028932	a place
028933	(which
028934	is
028935	translated,
028936	of the Skull”).
028937	“Place
028938	
028939	They offered him
028940	
028941	mixed with myrrh,
028942	wine
028943	
028944	but
028945	he did not
028946	take it.
028947	
028948	Then they crucified him
028949	
028950	
028951	and divided
028952	
028953	his clothes,
028954	
028955	throwing
028956	dice
028957	for them,
028958	
028959	to decide what
028960	each
028961	would take.
028962	It was
028963	
028964	
028965	nine o’clock in the morning
028966	
028967	when they crucified him.
028968	
028969	
028970	
028971	
028972	The inscription
028973	
028974	of the charge against him
028975	
028976	read,
028977	
028978	“The king
028979	
028980	of the Jews.”
028981	
028982	with him,
028983	
028984	And they crucified
028985	two
028986	outlaws
028987	one
028988	on
028989	his right
028990	
028991	and one
028992	on
028993	his left.
028994	
028995	
028996	
028997	Those who passed by
028998	defamed him,
028999	
029000	shaking
029001	
029002	their heads
029003	
029004	
029005	and saying,
029006	“Aha!
029007	
029008	You who can destroy
029009	
029010	the temple
029011	
029012	and rebuild
029013	it in
029014	three
029015	days,
029016	save
029017	yourself
029018	and come down
029019	from
029020	
029021	the cross!”
029022	In the same way
029023	
029024	
029025	even the chief priests –
029026	were mocking
029027	him among
029028	themselves:
029029	together with
029030	
029031	the experts in the law –
029032	
029033	others,
029034	“He saved
029035	himself!
029036	
029037	but he cannot
029038	save
029039	
029040	Let the Christ,
029041	
029042	the king
029043	of Israel,
029044	come down
029045	now,
029046	from
029047	
029048	the cross
029049	that
029050	we may see
029051	
029052	and believe!”
029053	
029054	
029055	Those who were crucified
029056	with him
029057	
029058	also spoke abusively to him.
029059	
029060	
029061	Now when it was
029062	
029063	noon,
029064	darkness
029065	came
029066	over
029067	the whole
029068	
029069	land
029070	until
029071	
029072	three in the afternoon.
029073	
029074	
029075	Around three
029076	o’clock
029077	cried out
029078	
029079	Jesus
029080	voice,
029081	with a loud
029082	“Eloi,
029083	Eloi,
029084	lema
029085	sabachthani?”
029086	which
029087	
029088	means,
029089	
029090	“My God,
029091	
029092	
029093	my God,
029094	
029095	
029096	why
029097	have you forsaken me?”
029098	
029099	
029100	When some
029101	
029102	of the bystanders
029103	heard
029104	it they said,

029109	Then
029110	someone
029111	
029112	filled
029113	a sponge
029114	with sour wine,
029115	put
029116	it on a stick,
029117	and gave it
029118	to him to drink,
029119	saying,
029120	“Leave
029121	him alone! Let’s see
029122	if
029123	will come
029124	Elijah
029125	to take
029126	him down!”
029127	
029128	But
029129	Jesus
029130	cried out
029131	voice
029132	with a loud
029133	and breathed his last.

029155	
029156	how
029157	he died,
029158	he said,
029159	“Truly

029189	and Salome.
029190	
029191	When
029192	he was
029193	in
029194	
029195	Galilee,
029196	they had followed him
029197	
029198	
029199	and given
029200	him support.
029201	
029202	other
029203	Many
029204	
029205	women who had come up with him

029217	is,
029218	the day before the Sabbath),

029220	Joseph
029221	
029222	of
029223	Arimathea,
029224	a highly regarded
029225	member of the council,
029226	who
029227	
029228	
029229	was himself
029230	looking forward
029231	
029232	to the kingdom
029233	
029234	of God,
029235	boldly
029236	went
029237	to
029238	
029239	Pilate
029240	
029241	and asked for
029242	
029243	the body
029244	
029245	of Jesus.
029246	
029247	
029248	Pilate
029249	was surprised
029250	if
029251	that he was already
029252	dead.
029253	
029254	He called
029255	
029256	the centurion
029257	and asked him
029258	
029259	
029260	for some time.
029261	he had been dead
029262	
029263	When Pilate was informed
029264	by
029265	
029266	the centurion,
029267	he gave
029268	
029269	the body
029270	
029271	to Joseph.
029272	
029273	After Joseph bought
029274	a linen cloth
029275	and took down
029276	the body,
029277	he wrapped it in
029278	
029279	the linen
029280	
029281	and placed it
029282	
029283	in
029284	a tomb
029285	
029286	
029287	cut
029288	out of
029289	the rock.
029290	
029291	Then he rolled
029292	a stone
029293	across
029294	
029295	the entrance
029296	
029297	of the tomb.
029298	
029299	
029300	Mary
029301	
029302	Magdalene
029303	
029304	and Mary
029305	
029306	the mother of Joses
029307	saw
029308	where
029309	the body was placed.
029310	
029311	was over,
029312	
029313	When the Sabbath
029314	Mary
029315	
029316	Magdalene,
029317	
029318	Mary
029319	
029320	
029321	the mother of James,
029322	
029323	and Salome
029324	bought
029325	aromatic spices
029326	so that
029327	they might go
029328	and anoint him.
029329	
029330	
029331	And very
029332	early
029333	
029334	on the first
029335	
029336	day of the week,
029337	they went
029338	to
029339	
029340	the tomb.
029341	
029342	
029343	at sunrise,
029344	
029345	They had been asking
029346	
029347	each other,
029348	“Who
029349	will roll away
029350	
029351	
029352	the stone for us
029353	from
029354	
029355	the entrance
029356	
029357	to the tomb?”
029358	
029359	But when they looked up,
029360	they saw
029361	
029362	had been rolled back.
029363	
029364	that the stone,
029365	which was
029366	
029367	large,
029368	very
029369	
029370	Then as they went
029371	into
029372	
029373	the tomb,
029374	they saw
029375	a young man
029376	sitting
029377	on
029378	
029379	the right side;
029380	dressed
029381	robe
029382	in a white
029383	
029384	and they were alarmed.
029385	
029386	But
029387	he said to them,
029388	
029389	“Do not
029390	be alarmed.
029391	Jesus
029392	You are looking for
029393	
029394	the Nazarene,
029395	
029396	who was crucified.
029397	He has been raised!
029398	not
029399	He is
029400	here.
029401	Look,
029402	there is
029403	the place
029404	where
029405	they laid him.
029406	
029407	But
029408	go,
029409	tell
029410	
029411	his disciples,
029412	
029413	
029414	
029415	even Peter,
029416	
029417	that he is going ahead of you
029418	
029419	into
029420	
029421	Galilee.
029422	there,
029423	
029424	You will see him
029425	just as
029426	he told you.”
029427	
029428	
029429	Then they went out
029430	and ran
029431	from
029432	
029433	the tomb,
029434	had seized them.
029435	for
029436	
029437	terror
029438	
029439	and bewilderment
029440	
029441	nothing
029442	to anyone,
029443	And they said
029444	they were afraid.
029445	because
029446	after he arose,
029447	
029448	[[Early
029449	on the first
029450	day of the week,
029451	he appeared
029452	first
029453	to Mary
029454	
029455	Magdalene,
029456	from
029457	whom
029458	he had driven out
029459	seven
029460	demons.
029461	She
029462	went out
029463	and told
029464	those who were
029465	with him,
029466	
029467	while they were
029468	mourning
029469	
029470	and weeping.
029471	And
029472	when they heard
029473	
029474	that he was alive
029475	
029476	and had been seen
029477	by her,
029478	
029479	they did not believe.
029480	After
029481	
029482	
029483	to two
029484	of them
029485	
029486	while they were
029487	this he appeared
029488	in
029489	a different
029490	form
029491	on their way
029492	to
029493	the country.
029494	
029495	They went back
029496	and told
029497	
029498	the rest,
029499	but they did not
029500	them.
029501	believe
029502	Then
029503	
029504	while they were eating,
029505	
029506	
029507	to the eleven themselves,
029508	he appeared
029509	
029510	and he rebuked them for their
029511	
029512	unbelief
029513	
029514	
029515	and hardness of heart,
029516	
029517	
029518	those who had seen him
029519	
029520	resurrected.
029521	because they did not
029522	believe
029523	
029524	He said
029525	to them,
029526	“Go
029527	into
029528	
029529	the world
029530	all
029531	and preach
029532	
029533	the gospel
029534	to every

029536	creature.
029537	
029538	The one who believes
029539	
029540	and is baptized
029541	will be saved,
029542	
029543	but
029544	the one who does not believe
029545	will be condemned.
029546	These signs
029547	
029548	
029549	those who believe:
029550	
029551	will accompany

029553	
029554	my name
029555	
029556	demons;
029557	they will drive out
029558	languages;
029559	they will speak
029560	in new
029561	
029562	with
029563	
029564	their hands,
029565	snakes
029566	they will pick up
029567	and
029568	poison
029569	whatever
029570	they drink

029574	harm them;
029575	on
029576	the sick
029577	their hands
029578	they will place
029579	
029580	well.”
029581	and they will be

029585	the Lord
029586	Jesus
029587	After
029588	
029589	had spoken to them,
029590	
029591	he was taken up
029592	into
029593	
029594	heaven
029595	
029596	and sat down
029597	at
029598	the right hand
029599	
029600	of God.
029601	They
029602	
029603	went out
029604	and proclaimed

029608	worked with them
029609	and
029610	
029611	the word
029612	confirmed

029651	Now
029652	many
029653	have undertaken
029654	to compile
029655	an account
029656	of
029657	
029658	that have been fulfilled
029659	among us,

029678	all things
029679	carefully
029680	an orderly account for you,

029700	of Judea,

029712	
029713	who was a descendant

029715	
029716	
029717	named

029719	Elizabeth,

029733	and ordinances
029734	
029735	of the Lord
029736	blamelessly.
029737	
029738	But they did not
029739	have
029740	
029741	a child,

029810	visibly shaken
029811	And Zechariah,
029812	when he saw
029813	
029814	with fear.
029815	the angel, was seized
029816	
029817	
029818	said
029819	But
029820	to him,
029821	
029822	
029823	the angel
029824	“Do not
029825	be afraid,
029826	Zechariah,
029827	for
029828	has been heard,
029829	
029830	your prayer
029831	
029832	
029833	
029834	and your wife
029835	
029836	Elizabeth
029837	will bear you
029838	a son;
029839	
029840	
029841	
029842	
029843	you will name him
029844	
029845	John.
029846	
029847	will come to you,
029848	Joy
029849	
029850	
029851	and gladness
029852	
029853	and many
029854	at
029855	
029856	his birth,
029857	
029858	will rejoice
029859	he will be
029860	for
029861	great
029862	in the sight of
029863	
029864	the Lord.
029865	
029866	wine
029867	
029868	or strong drink,
029869	
029870	He must never
029871	drink
029872	and
029873	Spirit,
029874	the Holy
029875	he will be filled with
029876	even
029877	before
029878	
029879	his birth.
029880	
029881	
029882	many
029883	
029884	of the people
029885	of Israel
029886	He will turn
029887	to
029888	the Lord
029889	
029890	their God.
029891	
029892	
029893	
029894	And he will go as forerunner
029895	before
029896	
029897	the Lord in
029898	the spirit
029899	
029900	and power
029901	of Elijah,
029902	to turn
029903	the hearts
029904	of the fathers
029905	back to
029906	their children
029907	
029908	and the disobedient
029909	to
029910	the wisdom
029911	of the just,
029912	to make ready
029913	for the Lord
029914	a people
029915	prepared for him.”
029916	
029917	said
029918	Zechariah
029919	to
029920	
029921	the angel,
029922	
029923	“How
029924	can I be sure of this?
029925	
029926	
029927	For
029928	I am
029929	an old man,
029930	
029931	
029932	and my wife
029933	
029934	is old as well.”
029935	
029936	
029937	
029938	
029939	
029940	answered him,
029941	
029942	The angel
029943	
029944	
029945	
029946	“I am
029947	Gabriel,
029948	
029949	who stands
029950	in the presence of
029951	
029952	God,
029953	
029954	and I was sent
029955	to speak
029956	to
029957	
029958	
029959	you and to bring you this good news.
029960	
029961	
029962	
029963	And now,
029964	
029965	you will be silent,
029966	
029967	
029968	unable
029969	to speak,
029970	until
029971	
029972	the day
029973	these things take place.”
029974	
029975	because
029976	
029977	you did not
029978	believe
029979	
029980	my words,
029981	
029982	which
029983	will be fulfilled
029984	in
029985	
029986	their time,
029987	
029988	
029989	were
029990	
029991	Now the people
029992	waiting for
029993	
029994	Zechariah,
029995	
029996	and they began to wonder
029997	in
029998	
029999	why he was delayed
030000	
030001	
030002	the holy place.
030003	
030004	When he came out,
030005	
030006	he was not
030007	able
030008	to speak to them.
030009	
030010	
030011	They realized
030012	
030013	a vision
030014	that he had seen
030015	in
030016	
030017	the holy place,
030018	
030019	
030020	because he was
030021	making signs to them
030022	
030023	
030024	and remained
030025	unable to speak.
030026	
030027	
030028	When
030029	was over,
030030	
030031	his time
030032	
030033	of service
030034	
030035	he went
030036	to
030037	
030038	his home.
030039	
030040	After
030041	
030042	
030043	
030044	some time
030045	became pregnant,
030046	Elizabeth
030047	
030048	his wife
030049	
030050	
030051	in seclusion.
030052	she kept herself
030053	months
030054	and for five
030055	She said,
030056	
030057	“This is what
030058	
030059	has done for me
030060	the Lord
030061	at
030062	the time
030063	when
030064	he has been gracious
030065	to me, to take away
030066	my disgrace
030067	
030068	among
030069	people.”
030070	In
030071	
030072	
030073	month
030074	
030075	the sixth
030076	was sent
030077	
030078	of Elizabeth’s pregnancy, the angel
030079	Gabriel
030080	by
030081	
030082	God
030083	to
030084	a town
030085	
030086	of Galilee
030087	
030088	called
030089	Nazareth,
030090	to
030091	a virgin
030092	engaged
030093	to a man
030094	whose
030095	name
030096	was Joseph,
030097	
030098	a descendant
030099	of David,
030100	
030101	
030102	name
030103	
030104	and the virgin’s
030105	was Mary.
030106	
030107	The angel came
030108	to her
030109	
030110	and said,
030111	“Greetings,
030112	favored
030113	
030114	one, the Lord
030115	is with you!”
030116	
030117	
030118	But
030119	by
030120	
030121	his words
030122	she was greatly troubled
030123	
030124	and began to wonder
030125	about the meaning
030126	
030127	
030128	of this greeting.
030129	
030130	
030131	said to her,
030132	
030133	So the angel
030134	
030135	“Do not
030136	be afraid,
030137	Mary,
030138	you have found
030139	for
030140	favor
030141	with
030142	
030143	God!
030144	
030145	Listen:
030146	You will become
030147	
030148	pregnant
030149	
030150	and give birth
030151	to a son,
030152	
030153	
030154	
030155	and you will name him
030156	
030157	Jesus.
030158	
030159	He will be
030160	great,
030161	and
030162	the Son
030163	of the Most High,
030164	will be called
030165	
030166	will give him
030167	
030168	and the Lord
030169	
030170	God
030171	
030172	the throne
030173	David.
030174	
030175	of his father
030176	
030177	
030178	He will reign
030179	over
030180	
030181	the house
030182	of Jacob
030183	
030184	
030185	forever,
030186	
030187	
030188	and his kingdom
030189	
030190	will never
030191	
030192	end.”
030193	said
030194	
030195	Mary
030196	to
030197	
030198	the angel,
030199	“How
030200	will this be,
030201	
030202	since
030203	a man?”
030204	I have not
030205	been intimate with
030206	
030207	replied,
030208	
030209	The angel
030210	
030211	
030212	Spirit
030213	“The Holy
030214	will come upon you,
030215	
030216	
030217	
030218	and the power
030219	of the Most High
030220	will overshadow you.
030221	
030222	Therefore
030223	
030224	
030225	the child to be born
030226	will be holy;
030227	he will be called
030228	the Son
030229	of God.
030230	
030231	“And look,
030232	Elizabeth
030233	
030234	your relative
030235	
030236	
030237	
030238	has also become pregnant
030239	with a son
030240	in
030241	her old age –
030242	
030243	now
030244	
030245	month!
030246	sixth
030247	she is
030248	in her
030249	
030250	although she was called
030251	barren,
030252	
030253	
030254	will be impossible
030255	with
030256	
030257	God.”
030258	
030259	For nothing
030260	said,
030261	So
030262	Mary
030263	“Yes,
030264	
030265	I am a servant
030266	of the Lord;
030267	let this happen to me
030268	
030269	according to
030270	
030271	your word.”
030272	
030273	
030274	departed
030275	from her.
030276	
030277	
030278	Then the angel
030279	got up
030280	
030281	Mary
030282	In
030283	
030284	those days
030285	
030286	and went
030287	into
030288	
030289	the hill country,
030290	
030291	hurriedly
030292	to
030293	a town
030294	of Judah,
030295	
030296	and entered
030297	
030298	
030299	house
030300	Zechariah’s
030301	
030302	and greeted
030303	
030304	Elizabeth.
030305	
030306	
030307	When
030308	heard
030309	
030310	greeting,
030311	
030312	Mary’s
030313	
030314	Elizabeth
030315	leaped
030316	
030317	the baby
030318	in
030319	
030320	her womb,
030321	
030322	
030323	was filled
030324	Spirit.
030325	with the Holy
030326	
030327	and Elizabeth
030328	
030329	She exclaimed
030330	voice,
030331	with a loud
030332	
030333	
030334	“Blessed
030335	are you
030336	among
030337	women,
030338	
030339	and blessed is
030340	
030341	the child
030342	
030343	in your womb!
030344	
030345	
030346	And who
030347	
030348	
030349	am I that
030350	should come and visit me?
030351	
030352	the mother
030353	
030354	of my Lord
030355	
030356	
030357	
030358	
030359	For
030360	the instant
030361	
030362	
030363	the sound
030364	
030365	of your greeting
030366	
030367	reached
030368	
030369	my ears,
030370	
030371	leaped
030372	in
030373	joy.
030374	
030375	the baby
030376	for
030377	
030378	my womb
030379	
030380	
030381	And blessed
030382	
030383	is she who believed
030384	
030385	would be
030386	fulfilled.”
030387	
030388	that what was spoken to her
030389	
030390	by
030391	the Lord
030392	
030393	said,
030394	And Mary
030395	exalts
030396	
030397	“My soul
030398	
030399	
030400	the Lord,
030401	
030402	has begun to rejoice
030403	
030404	and my spirit
030405	
030406	in
030407	
030408	God
030409	
030410	my Savior,
030411	
030412	
030413	because he has looked
030414	upon
030415	
030416	the humble state
030417	
030418	of his servant.
030419	
030420	
030421	For
030422	from
030423	
030424	now on
030425	blessed,
030426	will call me
030427	all
030428	
030429	generations
030430	
030431	has done
030432	
030433	great things for me,
030434	
030435	because he who is mighty
030436	
030437	and holy
030438	
030439	is his name;
030440	
030441	
030442	
030443	he is merciful
030444	
030445	from
030446	generation
030447	
030448	to generation
030449	
030450	to those who fear him.
030451	
030452	He has demonstrated
030453	power
030454	with
030455	his arm;
030456	
030457	he has scattered
030458	those whose pride wells up
030459	from the sheer arrogance
030460	of their hearts.
030461	
030462	He has brought down
030463	the mighty
030464	from
030465	their thrones,
030466	
030467	and has lifted up
030468	those of lowly position;
030469	the hungry
030470	he has filled
030471	with good things,
030472	
030473	the rich away
030474	and has sent
030475	empty.
030476	He has helped
030477	Israel,
030478	his servant
030479	
030480	remembering
030481	his mercy,
030482	as
030483	he promised
030484	to
030485	
030486	our ancestors,
030487	
030488	
030489	to Abraham
030490	
030491	
030492	and to his descendants
030493	
030494	
030495	
030496	forever.”
030497	stayed
030498	So
030499	Mary
030500	with
030501	
030502	Elizabeth about
030503	months
030504	three
030505	
030506	and then returned
030507	to
030508	
030509	her home.
030510	
030511	
030512	Now
030513	for Elizabeth
030514	came
030515	
030516	the time
030517

031127	her heart what they might mean.
031128	
031129

031235	who
031236

031238	
031239	and devout,
031240	looking for
031241	the restoration

031251	It had been
031252	
031253	revealed to him
031254	by
031255	
031256	Spirit
031257	
031258	the Holy
031259	that he would not

031266	
031267	Christ.
031268	the Lord’s

031271	So Simeon, directed by
031272	
031273	the Spirit,
031274	into
031275	
031276	the temple courts,
031277	
031278	and when
031279	
031280	brought in
031281	
031282	the parents
031283	
031284	the child
031285	Jesus
031286	
031287	to do
031288	
031289	according to
031290	
031291	what was customary
031292	
031293	the law,
031294	for him
031295	
031296	
031297	
031298	Simeon took him
031299	
031300	in
031301	
031302	his arms
031303	
031304	and blessed
031305	
031306	God,
031307	
031308	saying,
031309	“Now,
031310	to depart
031311	
031312	servant
031313	permit your
031314	Sovereign Lord,
031315	according to
031316	
031317	your word,
031318	
031319	in
031320	peace.
031321	
031322	have seen
031323	
031324	For my eyes
031325	
031326	
031327	your salvation
031328	
031329	that
031330	you have prepared
031331	in
031332	the presence
031333	of all
031334	
031335	peoples:
031336	a light,
031337	for
031338	revelation
031339	to the Gentiles,
031340	
031341	and for glory
031342	to your people
031343	
031344	Israel.”
031345	
031346	
031347	
031348	So the child’s father
031349	
031350	
031351	
031352	and mother
031353	were amazed
031354	at
031355	
031356	what was said
031357	about him.
031358	
031359	
031360	blessed them
031361	
031362	Then Simeon
031363	
031364	and said
031365	to
031366	Mary,
031367	
031368	his mother
031369	
031370	“Listen carefully:
031371	
031372	This child is destined
031373	to be the cause of
031374	the falling
031375	
031376	and rising
031377	of many
031378	in
031379	
031380	Israel
031381	
031382	and to be
031383	a sign
031384	that will be rejected.
031385	
031386	
031387	as well!”
031388	
031389	
031390	your own soul
031391	will pierce
031392	and a sword
031393	Indeed, as a result
031394	
031395	will be revealed –
031396	of
031397	many
031398	hearts
031399	of him the thoughts
031400	
031401	There was
031402	Anna
031403	also a prophetess,
031404	the daughter
031405	of Phanuel,
031406	of
031407	the tribe
031408	of Asher.
031409	
031410	She was
031411	
031412	old,
031413	very
031414	having been married
031415	to
031416	her husband
031417	years until his death.
031418	for seven
031419	
031420	
031421	
031422	
031423	
031424	
031425	She had lived as a widow
031426	since
031427	years.
031428	then for eighty-
031429	four
031430	
031431	She never
031432	left
031433	
031434	the temple,
031435	with fasting
031436	
031437	and prayer
031438	worshiping
031439	night
031440	
031441	and day.
031442	
031443	
031444	
031445	At that moment,
031446	she came up
031447	to them and began to give thanks
031448	
031449	to God
031450	
031451	and to speak
031452	about
031453	
031454	the child to all
031455	
031456	who were waiting for
031457	the redemption
031458	of Jerusalem.
031459	
031460	So when
031461	Joseph and Mary had performed
031462	everything
031463	
031464	according to
031465	
031466	the law
031467	of the Lord,
031468	they returned
031469	to
031470	
031471	Galilee,
031472	to
031473	town
031474	their own
031475	of Nazareth.
031476	
031477	And
031478	the child
031479	grew
031480	
031481	and became strong,
031482	filled
031483	with wisdom,
031484	
031485	and the favor
031486	of God
031487	was
031488	upon him.
031489	
031490	
031491	went to
031492	
031493	Now Jesus’ parents
031494	
031495	every
031496	year
031497	for
031498	Jerusalem
031499	
031500	the Feast
031501	
031502	of the Passover.
031503	
031504	When
031505	he was
031506	years
031507	twelve
031508	old, they went up
031509	
031510	according to
031511	
031512	custom.
031513	
031514	
031515	
031516	the feast was over,
031517	
031518	But when
031519	as
031520	
031521	they were returning
031522	
031523	stayed behind
031524	Jesus
031525	
031526	home, the boy
031527	in
031528	Jerusalem.
031529	
031530	did not
031531	know it,
031532	
031533	His parents
031534	
031535	(because they assumed
031536	but
031537	
031538	that he was
031539	in
031540	
031541	their group of travelers)
031542	they went
031543	a day’s
031544	journey.
031545	
031546	Then they began to look for him
031547	
031548	among
031549	
031550	their relatives
031551	
031552	
031553	and acquaintances.
031554	
031555	When they did not
031556	find
031557	him, they returned
031558	to
031559	Jerusalem
031560	to look for him.
031561	
031562	
031563	
031564	After
031565	days
031566	three
031567	they found him
031568	
031569	in
031570	
031571	the temple courts,
031572	sitting
031573	among
031574	
031575	
031576	the teachers,
031577	
031578	listening to them
031579	
031580	
031581	and asking
031582	them questions.
031583	Jesus were astonished
031584	And
031585	all
031586	
031587	who heard
031588	
031589	at
031590	
031591	his understanding
031592	
031593	
031594	and his answers.
031595	
031596	
031597	When his parents saw him,
031598	
031599	they were overwhelmed.
031600	
031601	said
031602	to him,
031603	
031604	
031605	His mother
031606	
031607	“Child,
031608	why
031609	have you treated us
031610	
031611	like this?
031612	Look,
031613	
031614	your father
031615	
031616	and I
031617	you anxiously.”
031618	have been looking for
031619	
031620	
031621	But he replied,
031622	
031623	
031624	“Why
031625	
031626	were you looking for me?
031627	
031628	Didn’t
031629	you know
031630	
031631	in
031632	
031633	
031634	my Father’s house?”
031635	
031636	that I must
031637	be
031638	
031639	
031640	
031641	Yet his parents did not
031642	understand
031643	
031644	the remark
031645	
031646	he made to them.
031647	
031648	
031649	Then he went down
031650	with them
031651	
031652	
031653	and came
031654	to
031655	Nazareth,
031656	
031657	and was
031658	obedient to them.
031659	
031660	
031661	
031662	But his mother
031663	
031664	kept
031665	all
031666	
031667	these things
031668	in
031669	
031670	her heart.
031671	
031672	
031673	And Jesus
031674	increased
031675	in
031676	
031677	wisdom
031678	
031679	and in stature,
031680	
031681	and in favor
031682	with

031745	a baptism
031746	of repentance
031747	for
031748	the forgiveness
031749	of sins.
031750	As
031751	it is written
031752	in
031753	the book
031754	of the words
031755	Isaiah,
031756	
031757	of the prophet
031758	“The voice
031759	of one shouting
031760	in
031761	
031762	the wilderness:
031763	‘Prepare
031764	
031765	the way
031766	for the Lord,
031767	straight.
031768	make
031769	
031770	his paths
031771	
031772	Every
031773	valley
031774	will be filled,
031775	
031776	and every
031777	mountain
031778	
031779	and hill
031780	will be brought low,
031781	
031782	will be made
031783	
031784	and the crooked
031785	
031786	straight,
031787	
031788	
031789	and the rough
031790	
031791	ways
031792	will be made smooth,
031793	
031794	will see
031795	and all
031796	humanity
031797	
031798	the salvation
031799	
031800	of God.’”
031801	John said
031802	So
031803	
031804	that came out
031805	to the crowds
031806	to be baptized
031807	by him,
031808	
031809	“You offspring
031810	of vipers!
031811	Who
031812	warned
031813	
031814	you to flee
031815	from
031816	
031817	the coming
031818	wrath?
031819	produce
031820	Therefore
031821	fruit
031822	that proves
031823	
031824	your repentance,
031825	
031826	and don’t
031827	begin
031828	to say
031829	to
031830	yourselves,
031831	as our father.’
031832	‘We have
031833	
031834	Abraham

031841	that God

031856	
031857	the root
031858	
031859	of the trees,
031860	is laid
031861	and every
031862	
031863	tree
031864	that does not
031865	produce
031866	fruit
031867	good
031868	will be cut down
031869	
031870	into
031871	the fire.”
031872	and thrown
031873	
031874	were asking him,
031875	
031876	
031877	So the crowds
031878	
031879	“What
031880	then
031881	should we do?”
031882	John answered them,
031883	
031884	
031885	
031886	
031887	“The person who has
031888	two

031890	must share
031891	
031892	none,

031902	
031903	Tax collectors
031904	to be baptized,
031905	
031906	and they said
031907	to him,
031908	
031909	“Teacher,
031910	what
031911	should we do?”
031912	
031913	
031914	He told them,
031915	
031916	
031917	no
031918	more
031919	than
031920	
031921	you are required to.”
031922	
031923	“Collect

031925	Then
031926	
031927	
031928	some soldiers
031929	He told them,
031930	“And as for us – what
031931	should we do?”
031932	
031933	
031934	
031935	
031936	
031937	from no one by violence
031938	“Take money
031939	or
031940	by false accusation,
031941	
031942	and be content
031943	
031944	with your pay.”
031945	
031946	were filled with anticipation
031947	
031948	
031949	While the people
031950	
031951	wondered
031952	and they all
031953	
031954	
031955	
031956	
031957	whether
031958	
031959	John
031960	perhaps
031961	
031962	could be
031963	
031964	the Christ,
031965	answered
031966	
031967	them all,
031968	
031969	John
031970	
031971	
031972	with water,
031973	“I baptize you
031974	
031975	than I am is coming –
031976	but
031977	one
031978	more powerful
031979	
031980	
031981	not
031982	I am
031983	worthy
031984	to untie
031985	
031986	the strap
031987	
031988	of his sandals.
031989	
031990	
031991	
031992	He will baptize you
031993	with
031994	Spirit
031995	the Holy
031996	
031997	and fire.
031998	His
031999	
032000	winnowing fork
032001	is in
032002	
032003	his hand
032004	
032005	to clean out
032006	
032007	his threshing floor
032008	
032009	
032010	and to gather
032011	
032012	the wheat
032013	into
032014	
032015	his storehouse,
032016	
032017	
032018	but
032019	the chaff
032020	he will burn up
032021	fire.”
032022	with inextinguishable
032023	with many
032024	
032025	And in this way,
032026	
032027	other
032028	exhortations,
032029	John proclaimed good news
032030	
032031	to the people.
032032	
032033	But
032034	Herod
032035	
032036	the tetrarch
032037	when John rebuked
032038	
032039	
032040	because of
032041	Herodias,
032042	
032043	wife,
032044	
032045	his brother’s
032046	
032047	
032048	and because of
032049	all
032050	that
032051	had done,
032052	the evil deeds
032053	
032054	he
032055	Herod added
032056	
032057	
032058	this to
032059	them all:
032060	
032061	He locked up
032062	
032063	John
032064	in
032065	prison.
032066	
032067	Now
032068	when
032069	
032070	were baptized,
032071	all
032072	
032073	the people
032074	
032075	Jesus
032076	also was baptized.
032077	
032078	And while he was praying,
032079	opened,
032080	
032081	the heavens
032082	
032083	descended
032084	
032085	Spirit
032086	
032087	and the Holy
032088	in bodily
032089	form
032090	like
032091	a dove.
032092	on him
032093	
032094	
032095	And a voice
032096	from
032097	heaven,
032098	came
032099	
032100	“You are
032101	
032102	Son;
032103	
032104	
032105	my one dear
032106	in

032308	he was famished.
032309	said
032310	
032311	
032312	
032313	The devil
032314	to him, “If
032315	the Son

032317	
032318	of God,
032319	command
032320	
032321	this stone
032322	
032323	to
032324	become
032325	bread.”
032326	
032327	answered him,
032328	
032329	
032330	
032331	Jesus
032332	“It is written,
032333	
032334	does not

032337	alone.’”
032338	live
032339	
032340	‘Man
032341	
032342	Then the devil led
032343	him up to a high place
032344	and showed him
032345	
032346	all
032347	
032348	the kingdoms
032349	
032350	of the world.
032351	in
032352	a flash
032353	
032354	
032355	said to him,
032356	
032357	
032358	And he
032359	
032360	“To you I will grant
032361	
032362	realm –
032363	
032364	this whole
032365	
032366	
032367	and the glory
032368	that goes along with it,
032369	for
032370	to me,
032371	it has been relinquished
032372	
032373	to anyone
032374	
032375	I wish.
032376	and I can give it
032377	
032378	
032379	So then,
032380	if
032381	you will worship me,
032382	
032383	
032384	will be yours.”
032385	
032386	all this
032387	
032388	answered him,
032389	
032390	Jesus
032391	
032392	
032393	“It is written,
032394	the Lord
032395	
032396	your God
032397	
032398	‘You are to worship
032399	
032400	
032401	only him.’”
032402	and serve
032403	the devil brought him
032404	Then
032405	
032406	to
032407	Jerusalem,
032408	
032409	had him stand
032410	on
032411	
032412	the highest point
032413	
032414	of the temple,
032415	
032416	and said to him,
032417	
032418	“If
032419	the Son
032420	you are
032421	
032422	of God,
032423	throw
032424	yourself
032425	from here,
032426	down
032427	it is written,
032428	for
032429	
032430	
032431	his angels
032432	
032433	‘He will command
032434	concerning you,
032435	
032436	
032437	to protect you,’
032438	
032439	
032440	
032441	and ‘with
032442	their hands
032443	they will lift
032444	you up,
032445	so that
032446	you will not strike
032447	against
032448	a stone.’”
032449	
032450	your foot
032451	
032452	
032453	answered him,
032454	“It is said,
032455	
032456	
032457	Jesus
032458	
032459	to the test.’”
032460	‘You are not
032461	to put
032462	the Lord
032463	
032464	your God
032465	
032466	
032467	had completed
032468	every
032469	temptation,
032470	
032471	So when the devil
032472	he departed
032473	from him
032474	
032475	until
032476	a more opportune time.
032477	
032478	returned
032479	
032480	Then Jesus,
032481	in
032482	
032483	the power
032484	
032485	of the Spirit,
032486	to
032487	
032488	Galilee,
032489	
032490	and news
032491	spread
032492	
032493	throughout
032494	
032495	the surrounding countryside.
032496	about him
032497	
032498	
032499	
032500	He began to teach
032501	in
032502	
032503	their synagogues
032504	
032505	and was praised
032506	by
032507	all.
032508	
032509	Now Jesus came
032510	to
032511	Nazareth,
032512	where
032513	he
032514	had been brought up,
032515	
032516	and went
032517	as was
032518	
032519	his custom.
032520	
032521	on
032522	
032523	day,
032524	
032525	the Sabbath
032526	into
032527	
032528	the synagogue
032529	
032530	He stood up
032531	to read,
032532	
032533	was given to him.
032534	
032535	and the scroll
032536	
032537	of the prophet
032538	Isaiah
032539	
032540	He unrolled
032541	
032542	the scroll
032543	and found
032544	
032545	the place
032546	where
032547	it was
032548	written,
032549	“The Spirit
032550	of the Lord
032551	is upon me,
032552	
032553	
032554	because
032555	he has anointed me
032556	
032557	to proclaim good news
032558	to the poor.
032559	He has sent me
032560	
032561	to proclaim
032562	to the captives
032563	release
032564	
032565	to the blind,
032566	and the regaining of sight
032567	
032568	those who are oppressed,
032569	
032570	to set free
032571	to proclaim
032572	the year
032573	of the Lord’
032574	s favor.”
032575	
032576	Then he rolled up
032577	
032578	the scroll,
032579	gave it back
032580	to the
032581	attendant,
032582	and sat down.
032583	
032584	of everyone
032585	
032586	The eyes
032587	in
032588	
032589	the synagogue
032590	were
032591	fixed on him.
032592	
032593	he began
032594	Then
032595	to tell them,
032596	
032597	
032598	
032599	“Today
032600	has been fulfilled
032601	
032602	this scripture
032603	
032604	even as you
032605	
032606	heard it being read.”
032607	
032608	
032609	All
032610	were speaking well of him,
032611	
032612	
032613	and were amazed
032614	at
032615	
032616	words
032617	
032618	the gracious
032619	
032620	coming out
032621	of
032622	
032623	his mouth.
032624	
032625	
032626	They said,
032627	“Isn’t
032628	son?”
032629	
032630	this Joseph’s
032631	
032632	
032633	Jesus said
032634	to them,
032635	
032636	“No doubt
032637	you will quote
032638	
032639	
032640	to me the proverb,
032641	
032642	‘Physician,
032643	heal
032644	yourself!’
032645	and say, ‘What
032646	we have heard
032647	that you did
032648	in
032649	
032650	Capernaum,
032651	do
032652	
032653	here
032654	in
032655	
032656	your hometown too.’”
032657	
032658	“I tell you
032659	And
032660	the truth,
032661	he added,
032662	
032663	
032664	no
032665	prophet
032666	acceptable
032667	is
032668	in
032669	
032670	his hometown.
032671	
032672	over
032673	in truth
032674	But
032675	I tell you,
032676	
032677	many
032678	widows
032679	there were
032680	in
032681	
032682	days,
032683	Elijah’s
032684	in
032685	
032686	Israel
032687	when
032688	was shut up
032689	
032690	the sky
032691	
032692	years,
032693	three
032694	
032695	
032696	and a half
032697	
032698	and there was
032699	famine
032700	a great
032701	
032702	all
032703	
032704	the land.
032705	
032706	to
032707	none of them,
032708	
032709	was sent
032710	Yet Elijah
032711	
032712	but only
032713	at
032714	Zarephath
032715	
032716	in Sidon.
032717	to
032718	a woman
032719	who was a widow
032720	
032721	many
032722	lepers
032723	And there were
032724	in
032725	
032726	Israel
032727	in the time of
032728	Elisha,
032729	
032730	the prophet
032731	
032732	yet none
032733	of them
032734	was cleansed
032735	
032736	except
032737	Naaman
032738	
032739	the Syrian.”
032740	
032741	were filled
032742	all
032743	with rage.
032744	the people in
032745	
032746	the synagogue
032747	When they heard this,
032748	
032749	
032750	They got up,
032751	forced him
032752	
032753	out of
032754	
032755	the town,
032756	
032757	and brought him
032758	
032759	to
032760	the brow
032761	
032762	of the hill
032763	on
032764	which
032765	
032766	their town
032767	was built,
032768	
032769	so that
032770	they could throw
032771	him down the cliff.
032772	
032773	But
032774	he passed
032775	through
032776	the crowd
032777	
032778	and went on his way.
032779	
032780	So he went down
032781	to
032782	Capernaum,
032783	a town
032784	
032785	in Galilee,
032786	
032787	he
032788	began to teach the people.
032789	
032790	and on
032791	
032792	the Sabbath
032793	
032794	They were amazed
032795	at
032796	
032797	his teaching,
032798	
032799	
032800	with
032801	authority.
032802	
032803	
032804	because he spoke
032805	
032806	
032807	Now in
032808	
032809	the synagogue
032810	there was
032811	a man
032812	who had
032813	the spirit
032814	demon,
032815	of an unclean
032816	
032817	and he cried out
032818	voice,
032819	with a loud
032820	“Ha! Leave us
032821	who
032822	
032823	
032824	
032825	alone, Jesus
032826	the Nazarene!
032827	Have you come
032828	to destroy us?
032829	
032830	I know
032831	
032832	
032833	you are –
032834	
032835	the Holy One
032836	
032837	of God.”
032838	
032839	rebuked him:
032840	
032841	
032842	But Jesus
032843	
032844	“Silence!
032845	
032846	Come out
032847	of him!”
032848	
032849	
032850	threw
032851	the man down
032852	
032853	Then, after the demon
032854	in
032855	
032856	their midst,
032857	he came out
032858	of him
032859	
032860	without
032861	hurting him.
032862	
032863	
032864	They were
032865	amazed
032866	
032867	all
032868	
032869	and began to say
032870	to
032871	one another,
032872	
032873	“What’s
032874	
032875	happening
032876	
032877	
032878	here? For with
032879	authority
032880	
032881	and power
032882	he commands
032883	
032884	the unclean
032885	spirits,
032886	
032887	and they come out!”
032888	
032889	spread
032890	So the news
032891	about him
032892	
032893	into
032894	all
032895	areas
032896	
032897	of the region.
032898	After Jesus left
032899	
032900	
032901	
032902	the synagogue,
032903	he entered
032904	
032905	
032906	house.
032907	Simon’s
032908	mother-in-law
032909	Now
032910	
032911	Simon’s
032912	was
032913	suffering from
032914	fever,
032915	a high
032916	
032917	and they asked
032918	
032919	Jesus to help her.
032920	
032921	
032922	So he stood
032923	over her,
032924	
032925	commanded
032926	
032927	the fever,
032928	
032929	and it left her.
032930	
032931	Immediately
032932	
032933	she got up
032934	and began to serve them.
032935	
032936	was setting,
032937	
032938	
032939	As the sun
032940	all
032941	those who
032942	had
032943	any relatives sick
032944	diseases
032945	with various
032946	brought them
032947	
032948	to
032949	
032950	
032951	
032952	one of them
032953	on every
032954	
032955	
032956	his hands
032957	Jesus. He placed
032958	and healed them.
032959	
032960	also came out
032961	
032962	
032963	Demons
032964	of
032965	many,
032966	crying out,
032967	
032968	
032969	
032970	
032971	“You are
032972	
032973	the Son
032974	
032975	of God!”
032976	
032977	But he rebuked them,
032978	and would not
032979	allow them
032980	
032981	to speak,
032982	
032983	because they knew
032984	
032985	the Christ.
032986	
032987	that he was
032988	The next
032989	
032990	morning
032991	Jesus departed
032992	and went
032993	to
032994	a deserted
032995	place.
032996	
032997	
032998	Yet the crowds
032999	were seeking him,
033000	
033001	
033002	and they came
033003	to
033004	him
033005	
033006	and tried to keep him
033007	
033008	
033009	
033010	leaving them.
033011	from
033012	
033013	
033014	But
033015	Jesus said
033016	to them,
033017	
033018	
033019	
033020	
033021	to the other
033022	towns
033023	proclaim the good news
033024	
033025	“I must
033026	
033027	of the kingdom
033028	
033029	of God
033030	
033031	too, for
033032	
033033	that is what I was sent to do.”
033034	
033035	So he continued
033036	to preach
033037	in
033038	
033039	the synagogues
033040	
033041	of Judea.
033042	
033043	Now
033044	
033045	
033046	
033047	and the crowd
033048	was pressing around him
033049	
033050	
033051	to hear
033052	
033053	the word
033054	
033055	of God.
033056	
033057	
033058	Jesus was
033059	standing
033060	by
033061	
033062	the Lake
033063	of Gennesaret,
033064	
033065	He saw
033066	two
033067	boats
033068	
033069	by
033070	
033071	the lake,
033072	
033073	but
033074	the fishermen
033075	of them
033076	
033077	had gotten out
033078	and were washing
033079	
033080	their nets.
033081	He got
033082	Then
033083	into
033084	one
033085	
033086	of the boats,
033087	which
033088	was
033089	Simon’s,
033090	and asked him
033091	
033092	from
033093	
033094	the shore.
033095	to put out
033096	a little way
033097	Jesus sat down
033098	and
033099	from
033100	
033101	the boat.
033102	taught
033103	
033104	the crowds
033105	When
033106	
033107	he had finished
033108	speaking,
033109	he said
033110	to
033111	
033112	Simon,
033113	“Put out
033114	into
033115	
033116	the deep water
033117	
033118	and lower
033119	
033120	your nets
033121	
033122	for
033123	a catch.”
033124	
033125	answered,
033126	Simon
033127	
033128	“Master,
033129	
033130	all
033131	night
033132	we worked hard
033133	nothing!
033134	and caught
033135	at
033136	But
033137	
033138	your word
033139	
033140	I will lower
033141	
033142	the nets.”
033143	
033144	
033145	When they had done this,
033146	they caught
033147	so
033148	fish
033149	many
033150	started to tear.
033151	
033152	
033153	that their nets
033154	
033155	
033156	So they motioned
033157	
033158	to their partners
033159	in
033160	
033161	the other
033162	boat
033163	
033164	to come
033165	and help them.
033166	
033167	
033168	And they came
033169	
033170	and filled
033171	both
033172	
033173	boats,
033174	so that
033175	they were about to sink.
033176	
033177	saw
033178	But
033179	when Simon
033180	Peter
033181	it, he fell down
033182	
033183	knees,
033184	at Jesus’
033185	saying,
033186	“Go away
033187	from me,
033188	
033189	
033190	man!”
033191	a sinful
033192	for I am
033193	Lord,
033194	were astonished
033195	For
033196	
033197	
033198	
033199	Peter and all
033200	
033201	who were with him
033202	
033203	at
033204	
033205	the catch
033206	
033207	of fish
033208	that
033209	they had taken,
033210	so
033211	and
033212	
033213	were James
033214	
033215	and John,
033216	sons,
033217	Zebedee’s
033218	
033219	who were
033220	business partners.
033221	
033222	Simon’s
033223	
033224	said
033225	to
033226	
033227	Simon,
033228	
033229	Then Jesus
033230	“Do not
033231	be afraid;
033232	from
033233	
033234	now on
033235	people!”
033236	you will be
033237	catching
033238	
033239	So when they had brought
033240	
033241	their boats
033242	to
033243	
033244	shore,
033245	they left
033246	everything
033247	and followed him.
033248	
033249	
033250	
033251	in
033252	
033253	While Jesus was
033254	
033255	
033256	one
033257	
033258	of the towns,
033259	
033260	
033261	a man
033262	came to him who was covered
033263	with leprosy.
033264	When he saw
033265	
033266	
033267	Jesus,
033268	he bowed down
033269	with
033270	his face
033271	to the ground and begged him,
033272	
033273	
033274	“Lord,
033275	if
033276	you are willing,
033277	you can
033278	make me
033279	clean.”
033280	
033281	So he stretched out
033282	
033283	his hand
033284	and touched him,
033285	
033286	saying,
033287	“I am willing.
033288	Be clean!”
033289	
033290	And immediately
033291	
033292	the leprosy
033293	left him.
033294	
033295	
033296	
033297	
033298	Then he ordered
033299	
033300	no one,
033301	the man to tell
033302	but
033303	commanded him, “Go
033304	and show
033305	yourself
033306	
033307	to a priest,
033308	
033309	and bring the offering
033310	for
033311	
033312	your cleansing,
033313	
033314	as
033315	commanded,
033316	Moses
033317	as
033318	a testimony to them.”
033319	
033320	spread
033321	But
033322	even more,
033323	
033324	the news
033325	about him
033326	
033327	
033328	were gathering together
033329	crowds
033330	and large
033331	to hear
033332	
033333	him and to be healed
033334	of
033335	
033336	their illnesses.
033337	
033338	
033339	Yet Jesus himself
033340	
033341	frequently withdrew
033342	to
033343	
033344	the wilderness
033345	
033346	and prayed.
033347	
033348	
033349	Now on
033350	one
033351	
033352	of those days,
033353	
033354	
033355	while he was
033356	teaching,
033357	
033358	there were
033359	sitting
033360	Pharisees
033361	
033362	and teachers of the law
033363	
033364	was with him
033365	nearby (who had come
033366	from
033367	every
033368	village
033369	
033370	of Galilee
033371	
033372	and Judea
033373	
033374	and from Jerusalem),
033375	
033376	and the power
033377	of the Lord
033378	
033379	to
033380	
033381	heal.
033382	
033383	
033384	Just then
033385	some men
033386	showed up, carrying
033387	on
033388	a stretcher.
033389	man
033390	
033391	
033392	a paralyzed
033393	
033394	They were trying
033395	
033396	to bring him
033397	
033398	in and place him
033399	
033400	before Jesus.
033401	
033402	
033403	no
033404	But since they found
033405	way
033406	to carry him
033407	
033408	in because
033409	
033410	of the crowd,
033411	they went up
033412	on
033413	
033414	the roof
033415	through
033416	
033417	the roof tiles
033418	and let
033419	him down
033420	on
033421	
033422	the stretcher
033423	
033424	
033425	right
033426	in front of
033427	
033428	Jesus.
033429	
033430	When Jesus saw
033431	
033432	their faith
033433	
033434	he said,
033435	“Friend,
033436	are forgiven.”
033437	
033438	
033439	your sins
033440	
033441	
033442	began
033443	to think
033444	
033445	Then the experts in the law
033446	
033447	
033448	and the Pharisees
033449	
033450	to themselves, “Who
033451	is
033452	
033453	this man who
033454	is uttering
033455	blasphemies?
033456	Who
033457	can
033458	sins
033459	forgive
033460	
033461	but
033462	alone?”
033463	
033464	God
033465	perceived
033466	
033467	
033468	When Jesus
033469	
033470	their hostile thoughts,
033471	
033472	
033473	he said
033474	to them,
033475	
033476	“Why
033477	are you raising objections
033478	within
033479	
033480	
033481	yourselves?
033482	Which
033483	is
033484	easier,
033485	to say,
033486	are forgiven,’
033487	
033488	
033489	‘Your sins
033490	
033491	or
033492	to say,
033493	‘Stand up
033494	
033495	and walk’?
033496	so that
033497	But
033498	you may know
033499	
033500	
033501	that the Son
033502	
033503	of Man
033504	authority
033505	has
033506	on
033507	
033508	earth
033509	to forgive
033510	sins” –
033511	he said
033512	
033513	to the paralyzed man –
033514	
033515	stand up,
033516	“I tell you,
033517	
033518	take
033519	
033520	your stretcher
033521	
033522	and go
033523	
033524	
033525	home.”
033526	
033527	
033528	Immediately
033529	he stood up
033530	before them,
033531	
033532	picked up
033533	on,
033534	
033535	the stretcher he had been lying
033536	and went
033537	
033538	
033539	home,
033540	
033541	glorifying
033542	
033543	God.
033544	
033545	Then astonishment
033546	seized
033547	them all,
033548	
033549	and they glorified
033550	
033551	God.
033552	
033553	They were filled
033554	with awe,
033555	saying,
033556	
033557	“We have seen
033558	incredible things
033559	today.”
033560	
033561	After this,
033562	
033563	Jesus went out
033564	
033565	and saw
033566	a tax collector
033567	named
033568	Levi
033569	sitting
033570	at
033571	
033572	the tax booth.
033573	
033574	he said to him.
033575	
033576	“Follow me,”
033577	
033578	
033579	leaving
033580	everything behind.
033581	And he got up
033582	and followed him,
033583	
033584	
033585	gave
033586	banquet
033587	a great
033588	Then Levi
033589	
033590	in
033591	
033592	his house for Jesus,
033593	
033594	
033595	and there was
033596	crowd
033597	a large
033598	of tax collectors
033599	
033600	and others
033601	
033602	
033603	with them.
033604	
033605	sitting at the table
033606	
033607	complained
033608	
033609	But the Pharisees
033610	
033611	
033612	and their experts in the law
033613	
033614	to
033615	
033616	his disciples,
033617	
033618	saying,
033619	
033620	“Why
033621	with
033622	
033623	tax collectors
033624	
033625	and sinners?”
033626	do you eat
033627	
033628	and drink
033629	
033630	answered them,
033631	
033632	Jesus
033633	
033634	
033635	
033636	don’t
033637	need
033638	
033639	
033640	“Those who are well
033641	a physician,
033642	but
033643	
033644	those who are sick do.
033645	
033646	I have not
033647	come
033648	to call
033649	the righteous,
033650	but
033651	sinners
033652	to
033653	repentance.”
033654	
033655	Then
033656	they said
033657	to him,
033658	
033659	
033660	disciples
033661	“John’s
033662	fast
033663	frequently
033664	
033665	and pray,
033666	do
033667	and so
033668	
033669	
033670	
033671	the disciples of the Pharisees,
033672	
033673	but
033674	yours
033675	continue to eat
033676	
033677	and drink.”
033678	
033679	So
033680	Jesus
033681	said
033682	to them,
033683	
033684	
033685	“You cannot
033686	
033687	guests
033688	
033689	make the wedding
033690	while
033691	
033692	
033693	the bridegroom
033694	with them, can you?
033695	
033696	is
033697	
033698	fast
033699	are coming,
033700	But
033701	those days
033702	
033703	and when
033704	is taken
033705	from them,
033706	
033707	
033708	the bridegroom
033709	
033710	they will fast.”
033711	at
033712	that
033713	
033714	time
033715	He also told them
033716	
033717	
033718	a parable:
033719	
033720	
033721	
033722	“No one
033723	a patch
033724	from
033725	garment
033726	a new
033727	tears
033728	and sews
033729	it on
033730	garment.
033731	an old
033732	If
033733	
033734	
033735	
033736	
033737	
033738	the new,
033739	he does, he will have torn
033740	
033741	
033742	the old.
033743	will not
033744	match
033745	
033746	and the piece
033747	
033748	from
033749	
033750	the new
033751	
033752	And no one
033753	pours
033754	wine
033755	new
033756	into
033757	wineskins.
033758	old
033759	If
033760	
033761	
033762	
033763	will burst
033764	
033765	wine
033766	
033767	he does, the new
033768	
033769	the skins
033770	
033771	
033772	and will be spilled,
033773	
033774	
033775	and the skins
033776	will be destroyed.
033777	Instead
033778	wine
033779	new
033780	into
033781	wineskins.
033782	new
033783	must be poured
033784	
033785	No one
033786	after drinking
033787	old
033788	wine wants
033789	the new,
033790	he says,
033791	for
033792	
033793	‘The old
033794	good enough.’”
033795	is
033796	
033797	
033798	on
033799	a Sabbath,
033800	Jesus was going through
033801	
033802	
033803	the grain fields
033804	
033805	picked
033806	
033807	and his disciples
033808	
033809	
033810	and ate them.
033811	
033812	some heads of wheat,
033813	rubbed
033814	
033815	them in their hands,
033816	some
033817	But
033818	
033819	of the Pharisees
033820	said,
033821	“Why
033822	are you doing
033823	what
033824	is against
033825	the law
033826	
033827	on the Sabbath?”
033828	
033829	answered them,
033830	
033831	
033832	
033833	
033834	Jesus
033835	“Haven’t
033836	
033837	you read
033838	what
033839	did
033840	David
033841	when
033842	were hungry –
033843	
033844	
033845	
033846	he and his companions
033847	
033848	
033849	how
033850	he entered
033851	
033852	
033853	the house
033854	
033855	of God,
033856	
033857	
033858	bread,
033859	
033860	the sacred
033861	took
033862	and ate
033863	
033864	and gave
033865	
033866	it to his companions?”
033867	
033868	which
033869	is not
033870	lawful
033871	for any to eat
033872	
033873	but
033874	alone,
033875	
033876	the priests
033877	
033878	Then he said to them,
033879	
033880	lord
033881	is
033882	
033883	of the Sabbath.”
033884	
033885	“The Son
033886	
033887	of Man
033888	
033889	
033890	On
033891	another
033892	Sabbath,
033893	Jesus entered
033894	
033895	
033896	
033897	the synagogue
033898	
033899	and was teaching.
033900	
033901	was
033902	Now a man
033903	there
033904	
033905	
033906	hand
033907	
033908	
033909	whose right
033910	was
033911	withered.
033912	watched
033913	
033914	Jesus closely
033915	
033916	The experts in the law
033917	
033918	
033919	and the Pharisees
033920	to see if
033921	on
033922	
033923	the Sabbath,
033924	he would heal
033925	so that
033926	they could find
033927	a reason to accuse him.
033928	
033929	
033930	But
033931	he knew
033932	
033933	their thoughts,
033934	
033935	said
033936	and
033937	
033938	to the man
033939	
033940	the withered
033941	who had
033942	
033943	hand,
033944	“Get up
033945	
033946	and stand
033947	
033948	
033949	here.”
033950	
033951	So he rose
033952	and stood there.
033953	said
033954	Then
033955	
033956	Jesus
033957	to them,
033958	
033959	“I ask you,
033960	
033961	
033962	is it lawful
033963	
033964	on the Sabbath
033965	to do good
033966	or
033967	to do evil,
033968	a life
033969	to save
033970	or
033971	to destroy it?”
033972	
033973	After looking around at them
033974	all,
033975	
033976	he said
033977	
033978	to the man, “Stretch out
033979	
033980	your hand.”
033981	
033982	
033983	
033984	The man did so,
033985	
033986	was restored.
033987	
033988	and his hand
033989	
033990	
033991	But
033992	they were filled
033993	with mindless rage
033994	
033995	and began debating
033996	with
033997	one another
033998	what
033999	
034000	they would do
034001	
034002	to Jesus.
034003	it was
034004	Now
034005	during
034006	
034007	this time
034008	
034009	that Jesus went out
034010	
034011	to
034012	
034013	the mountain
034014	to pray,
034015	
034016	
034017	and he spent all night
034018	in
034019	
034020	prayer
034021	
034022	to God.
034023	
034024	When
034025	came,
034026	morning
034027	he called
034028	
034029	his disciples
034030	
034031	
034032	and chose
034033	of them,
034034	
034035	twelve
034036	whom
034037	
034038	apostles:
034039	he also named
034040	Simon
034041	(whom
034042	
034043	he named
034044	Peter),
034045	
034046	Andrew;
034047

034758	to him, asking him
034759	
034760	to
034761	come
034762	and heal
034763	
034764	his slave.
034765	
034766	
034767	
034768	When they came
034769	to
034770	
034771	Jesus,
034772	they urged him
034773	
034774	earnestly,
034775	
034776	
034777	worthy
034778	“He is
034779	this for him,
034780	to have you do
034781	
034782	he loves
034783	because
034784	
034785	our nation,
034786	
034787	
034788	
034789	our synagogue.”
034790	
034791	and even built
034792	
034793	
034794	So
034795	Jesus
034796	went
034797	with them.
034798	
034799	
034800	
034801	When he was
034802	not
034803	
034804	far
034805	from
034806	
034807	the house,
034808	sent
034809	friends
034810	
034811	the centurion
034812	to say to him,
034813	
034814	“Lord,
034815	do not
034816	trouble
034817	not
034818	yourself, for
034819	worthy
034820	I am
034821	to
034822	under
034823	
034824	my roof!
034825	
034826	have you come
034827	That is why
034828	I did not
034829	
034830	presume
034831	to you.
034832	
034833	to come
034834	Instead,
034835	say
034836	the word,
034837	
034838	must be healed.
034839	
034840	and my servant
034841	
034842	
034843	For
034844	
034845	a man
034846	I too am
034847	under
034848	authority,
034849	set
034850	
034851	under
034852	me.
034853	with soldiers
034854	
034855	I say
034856	
034857	to this one, ‘Go!’
034858	
034859	and he goes,
034860	
034861	and to another,
034862	‘Come!’
034863	
034864	and he comes,
034865	
034866	
034867	and to my slave,
034868	
034869	‘Do this!’
034870	
034871	
034872	and he does it.”
034873	heard this,
034874	
034875	
034876	
034877	When Jesus
034878	he was amazed at him.
034879	
034880	
034881	He turned
034882	
034883	that followed him,
034884	
034885	to the crowd
034886	and said
034887	not even
034888	
034889	“I tell you,
034890	in
034891	
034892	Israel
034893	such
034894	faith!”
034895	have I found
034896	
034897	returned
034898	to
034899	
034900	the house,
034901	
034902	So when those who had been sent
034903	they found
034904	
034905	the slave
034906	well.
034907	
034908	
034909	
034910	
034911	Soon
034912	afterward Jesus went
034913	to
034914	a town
034915	called
034916	Nain,
034917	
034918	went with him.
034919	
034920	
034921	and his disciples
034922	
034923	
034924	crowd
034925	and a large
034926	As
034927	
034928	he approached
034929	
034930	gate,
034931	
034932	the town
034933	
034934	
034935	was being carried out,
034936	a man who had died
034937	the only
034938	son
034939	
034940	of his mother
034941	
034942	
034943	
034944	(who was
034945	a widow),
034946	
034947	crowd
034948	
034949	from the town
034950	and a large
034951	was
034952	with her.
034953	
034954	
034955	saw her,
034956	
034957	
034958	When the Lord
034959	he had compassion
034960	for her
034961	
034962	
034963	and said to her,
034964	
034965	“Do not
034966	weep.”
034967	
034968	Then he came up
034969	and touched
034970	
034971	the bier,
034972	
034973	
034974	and those who carried
034975	it stood still.
034976	
034977	He said,
034978	“Young man,
034979	
034980	get up!”
034981	I say to you,
034982	
034983	sat up
034984	
034985	So the dead man
034986	
034987	and began
034988	to speak,
034989	
034990	and Jesus gave him
034991	
034992	
034993	back to his mother.
034994	
034995	seized
034996	
034997	Fear
034998	them all,
034999	
035000	and they began to glorify
035001	
035002	God,
035003	saying,
035004	
035005	prophet
035006	“A great
035007	has appeared
035008	among us!”
035009	
035010	
035011	
035012	has come to help
035013	
035014	and “God
035015	
035016	his people!”
035017	
035018	
035019	Jesus circulated
035020	
035021	This report
035022	
035023	
035024	throughout
035025	
035026	Judea
035027	about
035028	
035029	
035030	and all
035031	
035032	the surrounding country.
035033	
035034	informed him
035035	John’s
035036	
035037	disciples
035038	
035039	about
035040	all
035041	
035042	
035043	called
035044	two
035045	
035046	
035047	of his disciples
035048	
035049	
035050	these things. So John
035051	and sent
035052	them to
035053	
035054	Jesus
035055	to ask,
035056	
035057	“Are
035058	
035059	you the one who is to come,
035060	or
035061	another?”
035062	should we look for
035063	came
035064	
035065	to
035066	
035067	
035068	When the men
035069	Jesus, they said,
035070	“John
035071	
035072	the Baptist
035073	has sent us
035074	
035075	to
035076	
035077	‘Are
035078	
035079	you to ask,
035080	
035081	you the one who is to come,
035082	or
035083	another?’”
035084	should we look for
035085	At
035086	that
035087	
035088	very time
035089	Jesus cured
035090	many people
035091	of
035092	diseases,
035093	
035094	sicknesses,
035095	
035096	spirits,
035097	and evil
035098	
035099	who were blind.
035100	to many
035101	and granted
035102	sight
035103	
035104	So he answered them,
035105	
035106	
035107	“Go
035108	tell
035109	John
035110	what
035111	you have seen
035112	
035113	and heard:
035114	The blind
035115	see,
035116	the lame
035117	walk,
035118	lepers
035119	are cleansed,
035120	
035121	the deaf
035122	hear,
035123	the dead
035124	are raised,
035125	the poor
035126	have good news proclaimed to them.
035127	
035128	Blessed
035129	is
035130	who
035131	anyone
035132	takes no
035133	offense
035134	at me.”
035135	
035136	had gone,
035137	
035138	
035139	messengers
035140	When John’s
035141	Jesus began
035142	to speak
035143	to
035144	
035145	the crowds
035146	about
035147	John:
035148	“What
035149	did you go out
035150	into
035151	
035152	the wilderness
035153	to see?
035154	A reed
035155	by
035156	the wind?
035157	shaken
035158	
035159	What
035160	did you go out
035161	to see?
035162	A man
035163	in
035164	soft
035165	clothing?
035166	dressed
035167	Look,
035168	
035169	those who wear
035170	soft clothing
035171	
035172	
035173	in luxury
035174	and live
035175	in
035176	the
035177	royal palaces!
035178	are
035179	
035180	What
035181	did you go out
035182	to see?
035183	A prophet?
035184	Yes,
035185	I tell you,
035186	
035187	
035188	and more
035189	than a prophet.
035190	
035191	This is
035192	the one about
035193	whom
035194	it is written,
035195	‘Look,
035196	I am sending
035197	
035198	my messenger
035199	
035200	ahead of you,

035208	before you.’

035212	greater
035213	among
035214	those born
035215	of women
035216	than John.
035217	no one
035218	is
035219	
035220	Yet
035221	the one who is least
035222	in
035223	
035224	the kingdom
035225	
035226	of God
035227	greater than he is.”
035228	
035229	is
035230	
035231	(Now all
035232	
035233	the people
035234	who heard this,
035235	
035236	
035237	even the tax collectors,
035238	acknowledged
035239	
035240	God’s justice,
035241	because they had been baptized
035242	
035243	baptism.
035244	with John’s
035245	
035246	However,
035247	the Pharisees

035249	
035250	and the experts in religious law

035252	purpose

035254	God’s
035255	rejected
035256	for
035257	themselves,
035258	because they had not
035259	been baptized
035260	by John.)
035261	
035262	“To what
035263	then
035264	should I compare
035265	
035266	the people
035267	
035268	of this generation,
035269	
035270	
035271	and what

035282	e and calling out
035283	to one another,

035285	
035286	‘We played the flute for you,
035287	
035288	
035289	yet you did not
035290	dance;
035291	we wailed in mourning,

035293	yet you did not
035294	weep.’
035295	has come
035296	For
035297	John

035299	the Baptist
035300	no
035301	eating
035302	bread
035303	no
035304	and drinking

035332	But wisdom

035334	all
035335	
035336	her children.”
035337	
035338	asked
035339	Now
035340	one
035341	
035342	
035343	of the Pharisees
035344	Jesus to
035345	have dinner
035346	with him,
035347	
035348	
035349	so he went
035350	into
035351	
035352	house
035353	
035354	the Pharisee’s
035355	and took his place at the table.
035356	
035357	
035358	Then when a woman
035359	who
035360	was
035361	at
035362	
035363	of that town,
035364	a sinner,
035365	
035366	learned
035367	
035368	that Jesus was dining
035369	
035370	
035371	house,
035372	
035373	the Pharisee’s
035374	she brought
035375	an alabaster jar
035376	of perfumed oil.
035377	
035378	As she stood
035379	behind
035380	him at
035381	
035382	his feet,
035383	
035384	weeping,
035385	
035386	with her tears.
035387	she began
035388	to wet
035389	
035390	his feet
035391	
035392	
035393	
035394	hair,
035395	
035396	
035397	
035398	She wiped them with her
035399	
035400	kissed
035401	
035402	them,
035403	
035404	
035405	and anointed
035406	
035407	them with the perfumed oil.
035408	saw
035409	Now
035410	
035411	when the Pharisee
035412	
035413	who had invited him
035414	
035415	
035416	to
035417	himself,
035418	this, he said
035419	
035420	“If
035421	this man were
035422	a prophet,
035423	he would know
035424	
035425	who
035426	
035427	and what kind of
035428	
035429	woman
035430	this is who
035431	is touching him,
035432	
035433	
035434	a sinner.”
035435	that she is
035436	
035437	answered him,
035438	
035439	So Jesus
035440	
035441	
035442	
035443	“Simon,
035444	I have
035445	
035446	something
035447	to say to you.”
035448	
035449	
035450	Teacher.”
035451	“Say it,

035453	had two
035454	debtors;

035456	creditor
035457	“A certain

035479	answered,
035480	Simon
035481	
035482	“I suppose
035483	
035484	the one who
035485	
035486	had the bigger
035487	debt canceled.”
035488	
035489	
035490	Jesus said to him,
035491	
035492	rightly.”
035493	“You have judged

035496	toward
035497	
035498	the woman,

035500	to Simon,
035501	he said
035502	“Do you see
035503	
035504	
035505	this woman?

035532	no
035533	You gave me
035534	
035535	of greeting, but
035536	from
035537	the time
035538	I entered
035539	she has not

035567	which were many,
035568	
035569	thus she loved
035570	much;
035571	
035572	but
035573	little
035574	is forgiven
035575	little.”
035576	loves
035577	Jesus said to her,
035578	Then
035579	
035580	are forgiven.”
035581	
035582	
035583	“Your sins

035586	
035587	But those who were at the table with
035588	to say
035589	among
035590	themselves,
035591	“Who

035593	is this,
035594	who

035597	even forgives
035598	He said
035599	
035600	to
035601	
035602	the woman,
035603	
035604	“Your faith
035605	
035606	has saved
035607	
035608	you; go
035609	in
035610	peace.”
035611	
035612	Some time
035613	
035614	
035615	afterward
035616	
035617	
035618	he went on
035619	through
035620	towns
035621	
035622	and villages,
035623	preaching
035624	
035625	and proclaiming the good news
035626	
035627	of the kingdom
035628	
035629	of God.
035630	
035631	
035632	The twelve
035633	were with him,
035634	
035635	
035636	women
035637	and also some
035638	who
035639	had been
035640	healed
035641	of
035642	spirits
035643	evil
035644	
035645	and disabilities:
035646	Mary
035647	
035648	(called
035649	Magdalene),
035650	from
035651	whom
035652	demons
035653	seven
035654	had gone out,
035655	
035656	and Joanna
035657	the wife
035658	of Cuza
035659	household manager),
035660	(Herod’s
035661	
035662	Susanna,
035663	
035664	others
035665	and many
035666	who
035667	provided for them
035668	
035669	out of
035670	
035671	their own resources.
035672	
035673	was gathering
035674	
035675	crowd
035676	While a large
035677	
035678	
035679	Jesus from
035680	one town
035681	and people were coming
035682	to
035683	
035684	after another, he spoke
035685	to them in
035686	a parable:
035687	went out
035688	
035689	“A sower
035690	
035691	to sow
035692	
035693	his seed.
035694	
035695	
035696	And as
035697	
035698	he sowed,
035699	
035700	
035701	some
035702	fell
035703	along
035704	
035705	the path
035706	
035707	and was trampled on,
035708	
035709	
035710	birds
035711	
035712	and the wild
035713	devoured it.
035714	
035715	
035716	Other
035717	seed fell
035718	on
035719	
035720	rock,
035721	
035722	and when it came up,
035723	it withered
035724	because
035725	
035726	no
035727	it had
035728	moisture.
035729	
035730	Other
035731	seed fell
035732	
035733	among
035734	
035735	the thorns,
035736	
035737	grew up with
035738	
035739	and they
035740	it and choked it.
035741	
035742	
035743	But other
035744	seed fell
035745	on
035746	
035747	soil
035748	
035749	good
035750	
035751	and grew,
035752	and it produced
035753	as much grain.”
035754	a hundred times
035755	
035756	As he said this,
035757	he called out,
035758	
035759	“The one who has
035760	ears
035761	to hear
035762	had better listen!”
035763	asked him
035764	Then
035765	
035766	
035767	his disciples
035768	
035769	what
035770	
035771	meant.
035772	
035773	this parable
035774	
035775	
035776	He said,
035777	
035778	“You have been given
035779	the opportunity to know
035780	
035781	the secrets
035782	
035783	of the kingdom
035784	
035785	of God,
035786	
035787	but
035788	for others
035789	they are in
035790	parables,
035791	so that
035792	although they see
035793	they may not
035794	see,
035795	
035796	and although they hear
035797	they may not
035798	understand.
035799	means this:
035800	“Now
035801	
035802	
035803	the parable
035804	
035805	The seed
035806	is
035807	
035808	the word
035809	
035810	of God.
035811	
035812	
035813	Those along
035814	
035815	the path
035816	are
035817	
035818	the ones who have heard;
035819	then
035820	comes
035821	
035822	the devil
035823	
035824	and takes away
035825	
035826	the word
035827	from
035828	
035829	their hearts,
035830	
035831	so that
035832	they may not
035833	believe
035834	and be saved.
035835	
035836	
035837	Those on
035838	
035839	the rock
035840	are the ones who
035841	when
035842	they hear it,
035843	with
035844	joy
035845	receive
035846	
035847	the word
035848	
035849	
035850	root.
035851	no
035852	but they have
035853	
035854	for
035855	a while,
035856	They believe
035857	
035858	but in
035859	a time
035860	of testing
035861	fall away.
035862	
035863	
035864	among
035865	
035866	thorns,
035867	As for the seed that fell
035868	
035869	these are
035870	
035871	the ones who hear,
035872	
035873	by
035874	the worries
035875	
035876	and riches
035877	
035878	and pleasures
035879	
035880	of life,
035881	but as they go on
035882	their way they are choked
035883	
035884	and their fruit does not
035885	mature.
035886	
035887	But
035888	as for the seed that landed on
035889	
035890	good
035891	soil,
035892	
035893	these are
035894	the ones who,
035895	to it with
035896	heart,
035897	an honest
035898	
035899	and good
035900	after hearing
035901	
035902	the word,
035903	cling
035904	
035905	and bear fruit
035906	with
035907	steadfast endurance.
035908	“No one
035909	
035910	a lamp
035911	lights
035912	and then covers it
035913	
035914	with a jar
035915	or
035916	it under
035917	a bed,

035919	but
035920	it on
035921	a lampstand
035922	puts
035923	so that
035924	
035925	those who come in
035926	can see
035927	
035928	the light.
035929	nothing
035930	For
035931	is
035932	hidden
035933	that
035934	will not
035935	revealed,
035936	be
035937	and nothing
035938	concealed
035939	that
035940	
035941	will not
035942	be made known
035943	
035944	to
035945	light.
035946	and brought
035947	
035948	So
035949	carefully,
035950	listen
035951	whoever
035952	
035953	for
035954	has
035955	will be given more,
035956	
035957	
035958	but whoever
035959	
035960	does not
035961	have,
035962	
035963	even what
035964	he thinks
035965	he has
035966	will be taken
035967	from him.”
035968	
035969	came
035970	Now
035971	to him,
035972	
035973	
035974	Jesus’ mother
035975	
035976	
035977	and his brothers
035978	
035979	
035980	not
035981	but they could
035982	get near him
035983	
035984	because
035985	
035986	of the crowd.
035987	he was told,
035988	So
035989	
035990	
035991	“Your mother
035992	
035993	
035994	
035995	and your brothers
035996	
035997	are standing
035998	outside,
035999	to see you.”
036000	wanting
036001	
036002	
036003	But
036004	he replied
036005	
036006	to them,
036007	
036008	“My mother
036009	
036010	
036011	and my brothers
036012	
036013	
036014	are
036015	
036016	
036017	the word
036018	
036019	of God
036020	those who hear
036021	
036022	and do it.”
036023	
036024	
036025	
036026	One
036027	
036028	day
036029	
036030	
036031	Jesus got
036032	into
036033	a boat
036034	
036035	
036036	with his disciples
036037	
036038	
036039	and said
036040	to them,
036041	
036042	“Let’s go across
036043	to
036044	
036045	the other side
036046	
036047	of the lake.”
036048	
036049	So they set out,
036050	as they sailed
036051	and
036052	
036053	he fell asleep.
036054	
036055	came down
036056	Now a violent
036057	windstorm
036058	on
036059	
036060	the lake,
036061	
036062	and the boat started filling up with water,
036063	
036064	and they were in danger.
036065	They came
036066	
036067	and woke him,
036068	
036069	saying,
036070	“Master,
036071	Master,
036072	we are about to die!”
036073	
036074	So
036075	he got up
036076	and rebuked
036077	
036078	the wind
036079	
036080	
036081	and the raging waves;
036082	
036083	
036084	
036085	they died down,
036086	
036087	and it was
036088	calm.
036089	he said to them,
036090	Then
036091	
036092	“Where
036093	
036094	is your faith?”
036095	
036096	they were afraid
036097	But
036098	and amazed,
036099	to
036100	saying
036101	one another,
036102	“Who
036103	then
036104	
036105	is this?
036106	
036107	
036108	
036109	even the winds
036110	He commands
036111	
036112	
036113	and the water,
036114	
036115	and they obey him!”
036116	
036117	
036118	So they sailed over
036119	to
036120	
036121	the region
036122	
036123	of the Gerasenes,
036124	which
036125	is
036126	opposite
036127	
036128	Galilee.
036129	As Jesus stepped
036130	
036131	
036132	
036133	
036134	ashore,
036135	met
036136	man
036137	a certain
036138	from
036139	
036140	the town
036141	him who was possessed
036142	by demons.
036143	
036144	time
036145	For a long
036146	no
036147	this man had worn
036148	clothes
036149	
036150	in
036151	a house,
036152	and had not
036153	lived
036154	but
036155	among
036156	
036157	the tombs.
036158	When he saw
036159	
036160	
036161	Jesus,
036162	he cried out,
036163	fell down before him,
036164	
036165	
036166	voice, “Leave me
036167	with a loud
036168	and shouted
036169	
036170	
036171	
036172	
036173	alone, Jesus,
036174	Son
036175	
036176	God!
036177	
036178	of the Most High
036179	I beg you,
036180	
036181	do not
036182	
036183	torment me!”
036184	Jesus had started commanding
036185	For
036186	
036187	spirit
036188	
036189	the evil
036190	to come out
036191	of
036192	
036193	the man.
036194	many
036195	(For
036196	times,
036197	it had seized him
036198	
036199	
036200	so he would be bound
036201	with chains
036202	
036203	and shackles
036204	and kept under guard.
036205	
036206	But he would break
036207	
036208	the restraints
036209	and be driven
036210	by
036211	
036212	the demon
036213	into
036214	
036215	deserted places.)
036216	asked him,
036217	then
036218	
036219	
036220	Jesus
036221	“What
036222	
036223	your name?”
036224	is
036225	
036226	
036227	He said,
036228	“Legion,”
036229	
036230	had entered him.
036231	demons
036232	because many
036233	
036234	
036235	
036236	And they began to beg him
036237	
036238	to
036239	not
036240	order them
036241	
036242	into
036243	
036244	the abyss.
036245	to depart
036246	
036247	Now
036248	there
036249	herd
036250	of pigs
036251	a large
036252	was feeding
036253	on
036254	
036255	the hillside,
036256	
036257	and the demonic spirits begged
036258	
036259	Jesus to
036260	let them
036261	
036262	into them.
036263	
036264	go
036265	
036266	permission.
036267	He gave them
036268	came out
036269	So
036270	
036271	the demons
036272	of
036273	
036274	the man
036275	and went
036276	into
036277	
036278	the pigs,
036279	
036280	of pigs rushed down
036281	
036282	and the herd

036284	
036285	the steep slope
036286	into
036287	
036288	the lake
036289	
036290	and drowned.
036291	saw
036292	
036293	
036294	When the herdsmen
036295	
036296	what had happened,
036297	they ran off
036298	
036299	and spread the news
036300	in
036301	
036302	the town
036303	
036304	
036305	
036306	and countryside.
036307	the people went out
036308	So
036309	to see
036310	
036311	what had happened,
036312	
036313	and they came
036314	to
036315	
036316	Jesus.
036317	
036318	They found
036319	sitting
036320	
036321	the man
036322	from
036323	whom
036324	
036325	the demons
036326	had gone out,
036327	clothed
036328	
036329	and in his right mind,
036330	at
036331	
036332	feet,
036333	
036334	Jesus’
036335	
036336	and they were afraid.
036337	it told them
036338	
036339	
036340	
036341	Those who had seen
036342	how
036343	had been healed.
036344	
036345	the man who had been demon-possessed
036346	
036347	asked
036348	
036349	Then all
036350	
036351	the people
036352	
036353	and the surrounding region
036354	
036355	of the Gerasenes
036356	Jesus to leave them
036357	
036358	
036359	
036360	fear.
036361	great
036362	alone, for they were seized with
036363	
036364	So
036365	he got
036366	into
036367	the boat
036368	and left.
036369	begged
036370	
036371	
036372	
036373	The man
036374	from
036375	whom
036376	had gone out
036377	
036378	the demons
036379	to go
036380	with him,
036381	
036382	but Jesus sent
036383	
036384	him away,
036385	saying,
036386	“Return
036387	to
036388	
036389	your home,
036390	
036391	
036392	and declare
036393	what
036394	
036395	has done for you.”
036396	
036397	God
036398	
036399	So he went away,
036400	throughout
036401	the whole
036402	
036403	town
036404	proclaiming
036405	what
036406	had done for him.
036407	
036408	
036409	Jesus
036410	when
036411	Now
036412	
036413	returned,
036414	
036415	Jesus
036416	welcomed him,
036417	
036418	
036419	the crowd
036420	they were
036421	because
036422	all
036423	waiting for him.
036424	
036425	
036426	
036427	came up.
036428	Then a man
036429	
036430	named
036431	Jairus,
036432	
036433	
036434	a leader
036435	
036436	of the synagogue,
036437	who was
036438	
036439	Falling
036440	at
036441	
036442	feet,
036443	
036444	Jesus’
036445	he pleaded with him
036446	
036447	to come
036448	to
036449	
036450	his house,
036451	
036452	
036453	daughter,
036454	an only
036455	because he had
036456	
036457	about
036458	years old,
036459	twelve
036460	
036461	
036462	and she was dying.
036463	As
036464	
036465	
036466	Jesus was on his way,
036467	
036468	
036469	the crowds
036470	pressed around him.
036471	
036472	
036473	Now a woman
036474	was
036475	there who had been suffering from
036476	
036477	a hemorrhage
036478	by
036479	years
036480	for twelve
036481	
036482	
036483	
036484	
036485	
036486	
036487	not
036488	but could
036489	
036490	anyone.
036491	be healed
036492	She came up
036493	behind
036494	Jesus and touched
036495	
036496	the edge
036497	
036498	of his cloak,
036499	
036500	
036501	and at once
036502	stopped.
036503	
036504	
036505	
036506	the bleeding
036507	
036508	
036509	asked,
036510	
036511	Then Jesus
036512	“Who
036513	
036514	was it who touched me?”
036515	
036516	denied
036517	
036518	When they all
036519	said,
036520	
036521	it, Peter
036522	“Master,
036523	
036524	the crowds
036525	are surrounding
036526	
036527	
036528	you and pressing against you!”
036529	
036530	But
036531	Jesus
036532	said,
036533	touched me,
036534	
036535	“Someone
036536	
036537	for
036538	I know
036539	that power
036540	has gone out
036541	from me.”
036542	
036543	saw
036544	
036545	
036546	When the woman
036547	
036548	that she could not
036549	escape notice,
036550	trembling
036551	she came
036552	
036553	and fell down before him.
036554	
036555	
036556	why
036557	
036558	she had touched him
036559	
036560	she explained
036561	In the presence of
036562	all
036563	
036564	the people,
036565	
036566	and how
036567	healed.
036568	she had been immediately
036569	
036570	Then
036571	he said to her,
036572	
036573	“Daughter,
036574	
036575	your faith
036576	
036577	has made you well.
036578	
036579	Go
036580	in
036581	peace.”
036582	While he was still
036583	
036584	speaking,
036585	house came
036586	someone
036587	from
036588	
036589	the synagogue leader’s
036590	and said,
036591	
036592	is dead;
036593	
036594	“Your daughter
036595	
036596	any longer.”
036597	do not trouble
036598	
036599	the teacher
036600	
036601	But
036602	when Jesus
036603	heard
036604	this, he told him,
036605	
036606	“Do not
036607	be afraid;
036608	just
036609	believe,
036610	
036611	and she will be healed.”
036612	when he came
036613	Now
036614	to
036615	
036616	the house,
036617	Jesus did not
036618	let
036619	go in
036620	anyone
036621	with him
036622	
036623	
036624	except
036625	Peter,
036626	
036627	John,
036628	
036629	and James,
036630	
036631	
036632	father
036633	
036634	and the child’s
036635	
036636	
036637	and mother.
036638	wailing
036639	Now
036640	they were all
036641	
036642	and mourning for her,
036643	
036644	
036645	but
036646	he said,
036647	“Stop
036648	your weeping;
036649	she is not
036650	
036651	dead
036652	but
036653	asleep!”
036654	
036655	And they began making fun of him,
036656	
036657	because they knew
036658	
036659	that she was dead.
036660	
036661	But
036662	Jesus gently took her
036663	
036664	by the hand
036665	
036666	and said,
036667	
036668	
036669	“Child,
036670	get up.”
036671	
036672	returned,
036673	
036674	Her spirit
036675	
036676	
036677	and she got up
036678	immediately.
036679	
036680	Then he told
036681	
036682	them to give her
036683	something to eat.
036684	
036685	were astonished,
036686	
036687	Her parents
036688	
036689	
036690	but
036691	he ordered them
036692	
036693	no one
036694	to tell
036695	
036696	what had happened.
036697	After Jesus called
036698	
036699	
036700	the twelve
036701	together, he gave them
036702	
036703	power
036704	
036705	and authority
036706	over
036707	all
036708	
036709	demons
036710	
036711	diseases,
036712	and to cure
036713	
036714	and he sent
036715	them out
036716	to proclaim
036717	
036718	the kingdom
036719	
036720	of God
036721	
036722	and to heal
036723	
036724	the sick.
036725	
036726	He said
036727	to them,
036728	
036729	nothing
036730	“Take
036731	for
036732	
036733	your journey –
036734	no
036735	staff,
036736	no
036737	bag,
036738	no
036739	bread,
036740	no
036741	money,
036742	and do not
036743	
036744	an extra
036745	tunic.
036746	take
036747	
036748	
036749	Whatever
036750	
036751	house
036752	you enter,
036753	there
036754	stay
036755	
036756	the area.
036757	until you leave
036758	
036759	Wherever
036760	
036761	they do not
036762	receive you,
036763	
036764	as you leave
036765	
036766	
036767	town,
036768	that
036769	
036770	the dust
036771	
036772	
036773	feet
036774	off your
036775	shake
036776	as
036777	a testimony
036778	against them.”
036779	
036780	they departed
036781	Then
036782	and went throughout
036783	
036784	
036785	the villages,
036786	proclaiming the good news
036787	
036788	and healing
036789	people everywhere.
036790	heard
036791	Now
036792	Herod
036793	
036794	the tetrarch
036795	
036796	that was happening,
036797	about everything
036798	
036799	and he was thoroughly perplexed,
036800	because
036801	
036802	were saying
036803	
036804	some people
036805	
036806	that John
036807	had been raised
036808	from
036809	the dead,
036810	
036811	others
036812	while
036813	
036814	were saying that Elijah
036815	had appeared,
036816	still others
036817	and
036818	
036819	of the prophets
036820	that one
036821	
036822	of long ago
036823	had risen.
036824	said,
036825	
036826	Herod
036827	“I had John
036828	
036829	beheaded,
036830	who
036831	but
036832	is
036833	
036834	this about
036835	whom
036836	I hear
036837	such things?”
036838	
036839	So Herod wanted
036840	to learn about Jesus.
036841	
036842	
036843	returned,
036844	
036845	When the apostles
036846	they told
036847	
036848	Jesus everything
036849	they had done.
036850	
036851	Then he took
036852	them with him
036853	and they withdrew
036854	
036855	privately
036856	to
036857	a town
036858	called
036859	Bethsaida.
036860	
036861	But
036862	when the crowds
036863	found out,
036864	they followed him.
036865	
036866	
036867	He welcomed them,
036868	
036869	spoke to them
036870	
036871	about
036872	
036873	the kingdom
036874	
036875	of God,
036876	
036877	
036878	those who needed
036879	
036880	healing.
036881	and cured
036882	
036883	Now
036884	the day
036885	began
036886	a close,
036887	to draw to
036888	so
036889	
036890	the twelve
036891	came and said to Jesus,
036892	
036893	“Send
036894	
036895	the crowd away,
036896	so
036897	they can go
036898	into
036899	
036900	the surrounding
036901	villages
036902	
036903	and countryside
036904	lodging
036905	
036906	and find
036907	and food,
036908	
036909	
036910	in
036911	an isolated
036912	place.”
036913	because we are
036914	he said
036915	But
036916	to them,
036917	
036918	“You give them
036919	
036920	
036921	something to eat.”
036922	
036923	
036924	They replied,
036925	no
036926	“We have
036927	
036928	more
036929	than
036930	loaves
036931	five
036932	
036933	fish –
036934	and two
036935	
036936	unless
036937	we go
036938	
036939	and buy
036940	for
036941	all
036942	
036943	these people.”
036944	
036945	food
036946	were
036947	(Now
036948	about
036949	men
036950	five thousand
036951	he said
036952	there.) Then
036953	to
036954	
036955	his disciples, “Have them
036956	
036957	sit down
036958	
036959	in groups
036960	of about
036961	each.”
036962	fifty
036963	
036964	So they did
036965	as Jesus directed,
036966	
036967	sat down.
036968	and the people all
036969	he took
036970	Then
036971	
036972	the five
036973	loaves
036974	
036975	
036976	and the two
036977	fish,
036978	and looking up
036979	to
036980	
036981	heaven
036982	he gave thanks
036983	
036984	
036985	and broke them.
036986	
036987	He gave
036988	
036989	them to the disciples
036990	to set before
036991	
036992	the crowd.
036993	
036994	ate
036995	
036996	and were satisfied,
036997	They all
036998	
036999	was picked up –
037000	
037001	and what was left over
037002	
037003	of broken pieces.
037004	baskets
037005	twelve
037006	
037007	Once
037008	when
037009	
037010	that I am?”
037011	
037012	Jesus was praying
037013	by
037014	himself,
037015	were nearby,
037016	
037017	
037018	and his disciples
037019	
037020	he asked them,
037021	
037022	say
037023	“Who
037024	
037025	
037026	
037027	do the crowds
037028	
037029	
037030	
037031	They answered,
037032	say
037033	“John
037034	
037035	the Baptist;
037036	others
037037	
037038	Elijah;
037039	still others
037040	and
037041	
037042	of the prophets
037043	that one
037044	
037045	of long ago
037046	has risen.”
037047	
037048	Then
037049	
037050	
037051	“But
037052	who
037053	
037054	he said to them,
037055	that I am?”
037056	Peter
037057	
037058	answered,
037059	do you say
037060	
037061	“The Christ
037062	
037063	of God.”
037064	
037065	But
037066	he forcefully
037067	
037068	commanded them
037069	not
037070	to tell
037071	this to anyone,
037072	saying,
037073	
037074	must
037075	
037076	“The Son
037077	
037078	of Man
037079	many things
037080	suffer
037081	
037082	and be rejected
037083	by
037084	
037085	the elders,
037086	
037087	chief priests,
037088	
037089	and experts in the law,
037090	
037091	and be killed,
037092	
037093	
037094	and on the third
037095	day
037096	be raised.”
037097	he said
037098	Then
037099	to
037100	them all,
037101	“If
037102	anyone
037103	wants
037104	my follower,
037105	
037106	to become
037107	he must deny
037108	himself,
037109	
037110	take up
037111	
037112	his cross
037113	
037114	
037115	daily,
037116	
037117	and follow me.
037118	
037119	whoever
037120	For
037121	
037122	wants
037123	
037124	his life
037125	
037126	to save
037127	will lose it,
037128	
037129	whoever
037130	but
037131	
037132	loses
037133	
037134	his life
037135	
037136	because of me
037137	
037138	
037139	will save it.
037140	
037141	what
037142	For
037143	does it benefit
037144	a person
037145	if he gains
037146	
037147	world
037148	the whole
037149	himself?
037150	but
037151	loses
037152	or
037153	forfeits
037154	
037155	For
037156	whoever
037157	is ashamed of me
037158	
037159	
037160	
037161	and my
037162	words,
037163	
037164	
037165	the Son
037166	
037167	of Man
037168	will be ashamed of that person
037169	when
037170	he comes
037171	in
037172	
037173	his glory
037174	
037175	
037176	and in the
037177	glory of the Father
037178	
037179	
037180	and of the holy
037181	angels.
037182	I tell you
037183	But
037184	
037185	most certainly,
037186	there are
037187	some
037188	
037189	here
037190	standing
037191	who
037192	
037193	will not
037194	experience
037195	death
037196	before
037197	
037198	they see
037199	
037200	the kingdom
037201	
037202	of God.”
037203	
037204	Now
037205	after
037206	
037207	these sayings,
037208	
037209	
037210	days
037211	about eight
037212	
037213	Jesus took with
037214	him Peter,
037215	
037216	John,
037217	
037218	and James,
037219	and went up
037220	
037221	
037222	the mountain
037223	to pray.
037224	
037225	
037226	As
037227	
037228	he was praying,
037229	
037230	
037231	the appearance
037232	
037233	of his face
037234	
037235	was transformed,
037236	
037237	
037238	and his clothes
037239	
037240	a brilliant white.
037241	became very bright,
037242	
037243	
037244	men,
037245	Then two
037246	began talking with him.
037247	
037248	
037249	
037250	Moses
037251	
037252	and Elijah,
037253	that
037254	They appeared
037255	in
037256	glorious splendor
037257	and spoke
037258	
037259	about his departure
037260	
037261	
037262	he was about to
037263	carry out
037264	at
037265	Jerusalem.
037266	
037267	Now
037268	Peter
037269	
037270	
037271	and those with him
037272	
037273	were
037274	quite
037275	sleepy,
037276	as they became fully awake,
037277	but
037278	they saw
037279	
037280	his glory
037281	
037282	
037283	
037284	and the two
037285	men
037286	
037287	standing with him.
037288	
037289	
037290	Then as
037291	
037292	
037293	were starting to leave,
037294	the men
037295	
037296	
037297	said
037298	
037299	Peter
037300	to
037301	
037302	Jesus,
037303	“Master,
037304	good for us
037305	it is
037306	
037307	here.
037308	to be
037309	
037310	Let us make
037311	shelters,
037312	three
037313	one for you
037314	
037315	
037316	and one
037317	for Moses
037318	
037319	and one
037320	for Elijah” –
037321	not
037322	knowing
037323	what
037324	he was saying.
037325	
037326	and
037327	
037328	As he was saying this,
037329	came
037330	a cloud
037331	
037332	overshadowed them,
037333	
037334	they were afraid
037335	and
037336	as
037337	
037338	they entered
037339	
037340	
037341	
037342	the cloud.
037343	
037344	Then a voice
037345	came
037346	from
037347	
037348	the cloud,
037349	saying,
037350	“This
037351	is
037352	
037353	my Son,
037354	
037355	
037356	my Chosen One.
037357	
037358	Listen to him!”
037359	
037360	After
037361	
037362	had spoken,
037363	
037364	the voice
037365	was found
037366	Jesus
037367	alone.
037368	
037369	
037370	So they kept silent
037371	
037372	no one
037373	and told
037374	at
037375	that
037376	
037377	time
037378	anything
037379	of what
037380	they had seen.
037381	
037382	Now
037383	
037384	on the next
037385	day,
037386	when they had come down
037387	
037388	from
037389	
037390	the mountain,
037391	met him.
037392	
037393	crowd
037394	a large
037395	
037396	
037397	Then a man
037398	from
037399	
037400	the crowd
037401	cried out,
037402	
037403	“Teacher,
037404	I beg
037405	
037406	you to look at
037407	
037408	
037409	my son –
037410	
037411	
037412	my only child!
037413	
037414	he is
037415	
037416	
037417	A spirit
037418	seizes him,
037419	
037420	
037421	and he suddenly
037422	screams;
037423	
037424	it throws
037425	him into convulsions
037426	
037427	and causes him to foam at the mouth.
037428	
037429	
037430	It hardly ever leaves
037431	
037432	him alone,
037433	torturing
037434	him severely.
037435	
037436	I begged
037437	
037438	your disciples
037439	
037440	to
037441	cast
037442	it out,
037443	
037444	not do so.”
037445	but they could
037446	answered,
037447	
037448	
037449	Jesus
037450	
037451	“You
037452	generation!
037453	unbelieving
037454	
037455	and perverse
037456	How much
037457	longer
037458	must I be
037459	with
037460	
037461	
037462	you and endure
037463	
037464	you? Bring
037465	here.”
037466	
037467	your son
037468	
037469	As
037470	
037471	the boy was approaching,
037472	
037473	threw him
037474	
037475	
037476	the demon
037477	
037478	to the ground and shook him with convulsions.
037479	rebuked
037480	But
037481	
037482	Jesus
037483	
037484	spirit,
037485	
037486	the unclean
037487	
037488	healed
037489	
037490	the boy,
037491	
037492	and gave
037493	him back
037494	
037495	to his father.
037496	
037497	astonished
037498	Then
037499	they were all
037500	at
037501	
037502	the mighty power
037503	
037504	of God.
037505	while the entire crowd
037506	But
037507	was amazed
037508	at
037509	everything
037510	
037511	Jesus was doing,
037512	he said
037513	to
037514	
037515	disciples,
037516	his
037517	“Take
037518	
037519	to
037520	
037521	heart,
037522	
037523	
037524	these words
037525	
037526	
037527	for
037528	the Son
037529	
037530	of Man
037531	is going to
037532	be betrayed
037533	into
037534	the hands
037535	of men.”
037536	
037537	But
037538	they did not understand
037539	
037540	this statement;
037541	
037542	
037543	
037544	its meaning had been concealed
037545	from them,
037546	
037547	so that
037548	they could not
037549	grasp
037550	
037551	
037552	it. Yet they were afraid
037553	to ask him
037554	
037555	about
037556	
037557	this statement.
037558	
037559	started
037560	Now
037561	an argument
037562	among
037563	
037564	
037565	the disciples as to which of them
037566	
037567	might be
037568	the greatest.
037569	
037570	
037571	But
037572	when Jesus
037573	discerned
037574	
037575	thoughts,
037576	
037577	their innermost
037578	
037579	he took
037580	a child, had him
037581	stand
037582	
037583	by
037584	his side,
037585	
037586	and said to them,
037587	
037588	“Whoever
037589	
037590	welcomes
037591	
037592	
037593	this child
037594	in
037595	
037596	my name

037598

037619	answered,
037620	
037621	John
037622	
037623	“Master,
037624	we saw
037625	someone
037626	in
037627	
037628	your name,
037629	
037630	casting out
037631	demons
037632	
037633	and we tried to stop him
037634	
037635	
037636	because he is not
037637	a disciple
037638	along with us.”
037639	
037640	said
037641	But
037642	to him,
037643	
037644	
037645	Jesus
037646	“Do not
037647	stop
037648	whoever
037649	him, for
037650	not
037651	is
037652	against
037653	
037654	for you.”
037655	
037656	you is
037657	
037658	Now
037659	when
037660	
037661	drew near for him
037662	
037663	the days
037664	
037665	to be taken up,
037666	
037667	
037668	
037669	
037670	resolutely
037671	Jesus set out
037672	
037673	to go
037674	to
037675	Jerusalem.
037676	
037677	He sent
037678	messengers
037679	on ahead of him.
037680	
037681	
037682	
037683	As they went along,
037684	they entered
037685	
037686	village
037687	a Samaritan
037688	
037689	to make things ready in advance for him,
037690	
037691	
037692	but the villagers refused
037693	to welcome him,
037694	
037695	
037696	
037697	determined
037698	
037699	because he was
037700	to go
037701	to
037702	Jerusalem.
037703	saw this,
037704	Now
037705	
037706	when his disciples
037707	James
037708	
037709	and John
037710	they said,
037711	“Lord,
037712	do you want
037713	us to call
037714	fire
037715	to come down
037716	from
037717	
037718	heaven
037719	
037720	and consume them?”
037721	
037722	Jesus turned
037723	But
037724	and rebuked them,
037725	
037726	
037727	and they went on
037728	to
037729	another
037730	village.
037731	
037732	As they were walking
037733	
037734	along
037735	
037736	the road,
037737	said
037738	someone
037739	to him,
037740	
037741	“I will follow you
037742	
037743	wherever
037744	
037745	you go.”
037746	
037747	said to him,
037748	
037749	
037750	Jesus
037751	
037752	“Foxes
037753	dens
037754	have
037755	
037756	
037757	and the birds
037758	
037759	in the sky
037760	have nests,
037761	
037762	but
037763	the Son
037764	
037765	of Man
037766	no
037767	has
037768	place
037769	
037770	his head.”
037771	to lay
037772	Jesus said
037773	
037774	to
037775	another,
037776	“Follow me.”
037777	
037778	
037779	But
037780	he replied,
037781	“Lord,
037782	let me
037783	
037784	go
037785	first
037786	and bury
037787	
037788	my father.”
037789	
037790	Jesus said to him,
037791	But
037792	
037793	“Let
037794	
037795	the dead
037796	bury
037797	
037798	their own
037799	dead,
037800	
037801	but as for you,
037802	go
037803	and proclaim
037804	
037805	the kingdom
037806	
037807	of God.”
037808	said,
037809	
037810	
037811	Yet another
037812	“I will follow you,
037813	
037814	Lord,
037815	first
037816	but
037817	let me
037818	
037819	say goodbye
037820	
037821	to
037822	
037823	my family.”
037824	
037825	said
037826	
037827	to him,
037828	
037829	
037830	Jesus
037831	“No one
037832	who puts
037833	
037834	his hand
037835	to
037836	the plow
037837	
037838	and looks
037839	
037840	
037841	back
037842	fit
037843	is
037844	
037845	for the kingdom
037846	
037847	of God.”
037848	After
037849	
037850	
037851	appointed
037852	
037853	this the Lord
037854	others
037855	seventy-
037856	two
037857	
037858	and sent them
037859	
037860	by
037861	two
037862	two
037863	on ahead of him
037864	
037865	
037866	into
037867	every
037868	town
037869	
037870	and place
037871	where he himself
037872	was about
037873	
037874	to go.
037875	He said
037876	
037877	to them,
037878	
037879	
037880	
037881	“The harvest
037882	is plentiful,
037883	
037884	but
037885	the workers
037886	are few.
037887	ask
037888	Therefore
037889	
037890	the Lord
037891	
037892	of the harvest
037893	to
037894	workers
037895	send out
037896	into
037897	
037898	his harvest.
037899	
037900	Go!
037901	
037902	I am sending
037903	you out
037904	like
037905	lambs
037906	
037907	surrounded
037908	by wolves.
037909	Do not
037910	carry
037911	
037912	a money bag,
037913	
037914	a traveler’s bag,
037915	or sandals,
037916	
037917	no one
037918	on

037920	the road.
037921	and greet
037922	
037923	Whenever
037924	
037925	
037926	you enter
037927	a house,
037928	first
037929	say,
037930	‘May peace
037931	
037932	be on this house!’
037933	
037934	
037935	And if
037936	there,
037937	is
037938	person
037939	a peace-loving
037940	will remain on him,

037947	but
037948	not,

037951	
037952	it will return
037953	in
037954	
037955	
037956	
037957	that same house,
037958	Stay
037959	eating

037966	what they give you, for

037987	eat
037988	
037989	what is set before you.

038000	has come

038051	on
038052	
038053	day
038054	that
038055	more bearable
038056	it will be
038057	than
038058	
038059	town!
038060	for that
038061	“Woe to you,
038062	
038063	Chorazin!
038064	Woe to you,

038067	
038068	For if

038072	and Sidon,
038073	done
038074	
038075	the miracles
038076	
038077	you had been done
038078	in
038079	
038080	long ago,
038081	
038082	in
038083	sackcloth
038084	
038085	and ashes.
038086	sitting
038087	they would have repented
038088	But
038089	for Tyre
038090	
038091	and Sidon
038092	more bearable
038093	it will be
038094	in
038095	
038096	the judgment
038097	than for you!
038098	
038099	
038100	
038101	And you, Capernaum,
038102	No,
038103	to
038104	heaven?
038105	will you be exalted
038106	to
038107	
038108	Hades!
038109	you will be thrown down
038110	
038111	“The one who listens

038117	and the one who rejects

038122	and
038123	
038124	the one who rejects me
038125	rejects
038126	
038127	the one who sent me.”
038128	
038129	returned
038130	Then
038131	
038132	the seventy-
038133	two
038134	with
038135	joy,
038136	saying,
038137	“Lord,
038138	
038139	
038140	even the demons
038141	submit to us
038142	
038143	in
038144	
038145	your name!”
038146	
038147	he said to them,
038148	So
038149	
038150	“I saw
038151	
038152	Satan
038153	like
038154	lightning
038155	from
038156	
038157	heaven.
038158	fall
038159	Look,
038160	I have given you
038161	
038162	
038163	authority
038164	
038165	to tread
038166	
038167	on snakes
038168	
038169	and scorpions
038170	
038171	and on
038172	the full
038173	
038174	force
038175	
038176	of the enemy,
038177	
038178	and nothing
038179	
038180	
038181	
038182	will hurt you.
038183	Nevertheless,
038184	in
038185	
038186	do not
038187	rejoice
038188	
038189	
038190	that the spirits
038191	
038192	submit to you,
038193	rejoice
038194	but
038195	
038196	
038197	that your names
038198	
038199	stand written
038200	
038201	
038202	heaven.”
038203	On
038204	
038205	
038206	that same occasion
038207	Jesus rejoiced
038208	
038209	
038210	Spirit
038211	
038212	in the Holy
038213	
038214	and said,
038215	“I praise you,
038216	
038217	Father,
038218	Lord
038219	
038220	of heaven

038222	
038223	and earth,
038224	
038225	because you have hidden
038226	
038227	these things from
038228	the wise
038229	
038230	and intelligent,
038231	
038232	and revealed them
038233	
038234	to little children.
038235	Yes,
038236	
038237	Father,
038238	
038239	for this
038240	your gracious will.
038241	was
038242	
038243	
038244	All things
038245	
038246	have been given to me
038247	by
038248	
038249	my Father.
038250	
038251	
038252	No one
038253	knows
038254	who
038255	is
038256	
038257	the Son
038258	
038259	except
038260	
038261	the Father,
038262	
038263	or who
038264	is
038265	
038266	the Father
038267	
038268	except
038269	
038270	the Son

038273	and anyone
038274	decides
038275	
038276	the Son
038277	to reveal him.”
038278	
038279	Then Jesus turned
038280	to
038281	
038282	his disciples
038283	
038284	privately,
038285	and said
038286	“Blessed
038287	
038288	are the eyes
038289	
038290	that see
038291	what

038293	I tell you
038294	For
038295	
038296	
038297	that many
038298	prophets
038299	
038300	and kings
038301	longed
038302	to see
038303	what
038304	
038305	you see
038306	
038307	but did not
038308	see it,
038309	
038310	and to hear
038311	what
038312	you hear
038313	
038314	but did not
038315	hear it.”
038316	
038317	
038318	Now an expert in religious law
038319	
038320	stood up
038321	to test
038322	
038323	Jesus, saying,
038324	“Teacher,
038325	what
038326	must I do
038327	life?”
038328	eternal
038329	to inherit
038330	
038331	
038332	He said
038333	to him,
038334	
038335	in
038336	
038337	the law?
038338	“What
038339	is written
038340	How
038341	do you understand it?”
038342	
038343	
038344	The expert answered,
038345	
038346	“Love
038347	the Lord
038348	
038349	your God
038350	
038351	with
038352	all
038353	
038354	your heart,
038355	
038356	
038357	with
038358	all
038359	
038360	your soul,
038361	
038362	
038363	with
038364	all
038365	
038366	your strength,
038367	
038368	
038369	and with
038370	all
038371	
038372	your mind,
038373	
038374	
038375	
038376	and love your neighbor
038377	
038378	as
038379	yourself.”
038380	Jesus said to him,
038381	
038382	
038383	correctly;
038384	“You have answered
038385	
038386	do this,
038387	
038388	and you will live.”
038389	
038390	But
038391	the expert, wanting
038392	to justify
038393	himself,
038394	said
038395	to
038396	
038397	Jesus,
038398	
038399	“And who
038400	is
038401	
038402	my neighbor?”
038403	
038404	
038405	Jesus
038406	replied,
038407	“A man
038408	
038409	was going down
038410	from
038411	Jerusalem
038412	to
038413	Jericho,
038414	
038415	of robbers,
038416	and fell into the hands
038417	
038418	
038419	who stripped him,
038420	
038421	
038422	beat
038423	
038424	him up, and went off,
038425	leaving
038426	him half dead.
038427	by
038428	chance
038429	Now
038430	a priest
038431	
038432	was going down
038433	
038434	
038435	road,
038436	that
038437	
038438	but when he saw
038439	the injured man
038440	he passed by on the other side.
038441	too
038442	So
038443	
038444	a Levite,
038445	
038446	
038447	
038448	to the place
038449	when he came up
038450	
038451	and saw
038452	him, passed by on the other side.
038453	a Samaritan
038454	But
038455	who
038456	was traveling
038457	came
038458	to where
038459	
038460	
038461	the injured man was, and when he saw
038462	him, he felt compassion for him.
038463	
038464	He went up to him
038465	and bandaged
038466	
038467	his wounds,
038468	
038469	pouring
038470	olive oil
038471	
038472	and wine
038473	he put him
038474	on them. Then
038475	
038476	on
038477	
038478	his own
038479	animal,
038480	brought him
038481	
038482	to
038483	an inn,
038484	
038485	and took care of him.
038486	
038487	
038488	
038489	
038490	The next day
038491	he took out
038492	and gave
038493	two
038494	silver coins
038495	
038496	them to the innkeeper,
038497	
038498	saying,
038499	‘Take care of him,
038500	
038501	
038502	and whatever
038503	else
038504	
038505	you spend,
038506	
038507	
038508	
038509	you when I come back this way.’
038510	
038511	I will repay
038512	
038513	Which
038514	
038515	
038516	of these three
038517	a neighbor
038518	do you think
038519	
038520	became
038521	
038522	to the man who fell
038523	into
038524	
038525	the hands of the robbers?”
038526	
038527	
038528	The expert in religious law said,
038529	
038530	“The one who showed
038531	
038532	mercy
038533	to him.”
038534	
038535	said
038536	So
038537	
038538	
038539	Jesus
038540	to him, “Go
038541	
038542	
038543	and do
038544	the same.”
038545	as
038546	Now
038547	
038548	they went on
038549	
038550	
038551	their way, Jesus entered
038552	
038553	village
038554	a certain
038555	a woman
038556	
038557	where
038558	named
038559	Martha
038560	welcomed
038561	him as a guest.
038562	
038563	She
038564	had
038565	a sister
038566	named
038567	Mary,
038568	who
038569	
038570	sat
038571	at
038572	
038573	feet
038574	
038575	the Lord’s
038576	and listened
038577	
038578	to what he said.
038579	
038580	
038581	But
038582	Martha
038583	was distracted
038584	with
038585	all
038586	the preparations
038587	she came up
038588	she had to make, so
038589	to him and said,
038590	“Lord,
038591	don’t
038592	you care
038593	
038594	
038595	
038596	that my sister
038597	
038598	alone?
038599	
038600	has left me
038601	to do all the work
038602	Tell
038603	
038604	
038605	her to
038606	
038607	help me.”
038608	answered her,
038609	But
038610	
038611	
038612	
038613	the Lord
038614	“Martha,
038615	Martha,
038616	you are worried
038617	
038618	and troubled
038619	about
038620	many things,
038621	one thing
038622	but
038623	is
038624	needed.
038625	Mary
038626	
038627	
038628	the best
038629	part;
038630	has chosen
038631	
038632	it will not
038633	be taken away from her.”
038634	
038635	
038636	
038637	in
038638	
038639	Now Jesus was
038640	
038641	
038642	place.
038643	a certain
038644	praying
038645	When
038646	he stopped,
038647	said
038648	one
038649	
038650	of his disciples
038651	
038652	to him,
038653	
038654	“Lord,
038655	teach us
038656	
038657	to pray,
038658	just as
038659	
038660	John
038661	taught
038662	
038663	his disciples.”
038664	
038665	he said to them,
038666	So
038667	
038668	“When
038669	you pray,
038670	Father,
038671	say:
038672	be honored;
038673	
038674	may your name
038675	
038676	come.
038677	
038678	may your kingdom
038679	
038680	
038681	bread,
038682	
038683	
038684	our daily
038685	Give us
038686	
038687	
038688	each
038689	day
038690	
038691	and forgive us
038692	
038693	
038694	our sins,
038695	
038696	
038697	for
038698	
038699	we also forgive
038700	everyone
038701	who sins against us.
038702	
038703	
038704	And do not
038705	lead us
038706	
038707	into
038708	temptation.”
038709	
038710	Then he said
038711	to them,
038712	
038713	“Suppose one
038714	of
038715	
038716	you has
038717	a friend,
038718	
038719	and you go
038720	to him
038721	
038722	at midnight
038723	
038724	and say
038725	
038726	to him, ‘Friend,
038727	lend me
038728	
038729	three
038730	loaves of bread,
038731	because
038732	a friend
038733	
038734	of mine has stopped
038735	here while on
038736	a journey,
038737	
038738	
038739	
038740	nothing
038741	and I have
038742	
038743	to set before him.’
038744	
038745	Then he
038746	from inside,
038747	will reply
038748	
038749	‘Do not
038750	
038751	bother me.
038752	
038753	is already
038754	
038755	The door
038756	shut,
038757	and
038758	
038759	my children
038760	
038761	and
038762	I
038763	in
038764	
038765	bed.
038766	are
038767	
038768	I cannot
038769	get up
038770	and give you anything.’
038771	
038772	I tell you,
038773	
038774	even though
038775	
038776	the man inside will not
038777	and give him
038778	
038779	get up
038780	anything because
038781	
038782	he is
038783	his friend,
038784	
038785	because
038786	yet
038787	
038788	of the first man’s sheer persistence
038789	
038790	he will get up
038791	and give him
038792	
038793	whatever
038794	he needs.
038795	“So I
038796	
038797	tell
038798	you: Ask,
038799	
038800	and it will be given
038801	
038802	to you; seek,
038803	
038804	and you will find;
038805	knock,
038806	
038807	and the door will be opened for you.
038808	
038809	everyone
038810	For
038811	
038812	who asks
038813	receives,
038814	
038815	
038816	and the one who seeks
038817	finds,
038818	
038819	
038820	and to the one who knocks,
038821	the door will be opened.
038822	What
038823	
038824	among you,
038825	
038826	
038827	father
038828	asks for
038829	
038830	if your son
038831	a fish,
038832	
038833	instead of
038834	a fish?
038835	a snake
038836	
038837	will give him
038838	Or
038839	
038840	if he asks for
038841	an egg,
038842	will give him
038843	
038844	a scorpion?
038845	If you
038846	then,
038847	
038848	evil,
038849	although you are
038850	know
038851	gifts
038852	good
038853	how to give
038854	
038855	to your children,
038856	
038857	how much
038858	more
038859	
038860	Father
038861	
038862	
038863	will the heavenly
038864	give
038865	Spirit
038866	the Holy
038867	
038868	to those who ask him!”
038869	
038870	
038871	Now he was
038872	casting out
038873	a demon
038874	
038875	
038876	
038877	mute.
038878	that was
038879	
038880	
038881	When the demon
038882	had gone out,
038883	began to speak,
038884	
038885	the man who had been mute
038886	
038887	were amazed.
038888	
038889	and the crowds
038890	some
038891	But
038892	of them
038893	
038894	said,
038895	“By
038896	the power of Beelzebul,
038897	
038898	the ruler
038899	
038900	of demons,
038901	he casts out
038902	
038903	demons!”
038904	Others,
038905	
038906	to test
038907	a sign
038908	from
038909	heaven.
038910	him, began asking for
038911	
038912	
038913	
038914	But
038915	Jesus, realizing
038916	
038917	
038918	their thoughts,
038919	said to them,
038920	
038921	“Every
038922	kingdom
038923	against
038924	itself
038925	divided
038926	is destroyed,
038927	
038928	
038929	and a divided
038930	household
038931	falls.
038932	if
038933	So
038934	
038935	
038936	Satan
038937	against
038938	himself,
038939	too is divided
038940	how
038941	stand?
038942	
038943	will his kingdom
038944	
038945	
038946	I ask you this because you claim
038947	by
038948	Beelzebul.
038949	that I cast out
038950	
038951	
038952	demons
038953	if
038954	Now
038955	
038956	by
038957	Beelzebul,
038958	I cast out
038959	
038960	demons
038961	
038962	do your sons
038963	
038964	by
038965	whom
038966	cast them out?
038967	
038968	Therefore
038969	they
038970	
038971	your judges.
038972	will be
038973	if
038974	But
038975	by
038976	the finger
038977	of God,
038978	
038979	I cast out
038980	
038981	demons
038982	then
038983	has already overtaken you.
038984	
038985	
038986	
038987	the kingdom
038988	
038989	of God
038990	When
038991	
038992	a strong man,
038993	fully armed,
038994	guards
038995	
038996	his own
038997	palace,
038998	
038999	safe.
039000	are
039001	
039002	his possessions
039003	
039004	when
039005	But
039006	a stronger man
039007	
039008	attacks
039009	and conquers him,
039010	
039011	
039012	the first man’s armor
039013	
039014	he takes away
039015	on
039016	which
039017	the man relied
039018	
039019	
039020	his plunder.
039021	
039022	and divides up
039023	
039024	not
039025	Whoever is
039026	with me
039027	
039028	against me,
039029	
039030	is
039031	
039032	
039033	and whoever does not
039034	gather
039035	with me
039036	
039037	scatters.
039038	“When
039039	
039040	an unclean
039041	spirit
039042	goes out
039043	of
039044	
039045	a person,
039046	it passes
039047	through
039048	waterless
039049	places
039050	looking for
039051	rest
039052	
039053	but not
039054	finding
039055	
039056	any. Then it says,
039057	‘I will return
039058	to
039059	
039060	the home
039061	
039062	
039063	I left.’
039064	
039065	When it returns,
039066	it finds
039067	the house swept clean
039068	
039069	and put in order.
039070	Then
039071	it goes
039072	
039073	and brings
039074	other
039075	spirits
039076	more evil
039077	than itself,
039078	seven
039079	
039080	and they go in
039081	and live
039082	there,
039083	
039084	is
039085	
039086	so the last state
039087	
039088	person
039089	of that
039090	worse
039091	
039092	than the first.”
039093	
039094	
039095	As
039096	
039097	he said
039098	
039099	
039100	
039101	
039102	
039103	these things, a woman
039104	in
039105	
039106	the crowd
039107	spoke out to him,
039108	
039109	“Blessed
039110	
039111	is the womb
039112	
039113	that bore you
039114	
039115	
039116	and the breasts
039117	at which
039118	you nursed!”
039119	
039120	But
039121	he replied,
039122	rather
039123	“Blessed
039124	
039125	are those who hear
039126	
039127	the word
039128	
039129	of God
039130	
039131	and obey it!”
039132	
039133	
039134	As the crowds
039135	were increasing,
039136	Jesus began
039137	to say,
039138	
039139	“This generation
039140	
039141	generation;
039142	a wicked
039143	is
039144	a sign,
039145	it looks for
039146	
039147	sign
039148	but no
039149	will be given to it
039150	
039151	
039152	except
039153	
039154	the sign
039155	of Jonah.
039156	just as
039157	For
039158	became
039159	Jonah
039160	
039161	to the people of Nineveh,
039162	a sign
039163	so
039164	will be
039165	
039166	
039167	the Son
039168	
039169	of Man
039170	
039171	generation.
039172	a sign to this
039173	The queen
039174	of the South
039175	will rise up
039176	at
039177	
039178	the judgment
039179	with
039180	
039181	the people
039182	
039183	of this generation
039184	
039185	
039186	and condemn them,
039187	
039188	
039189	because she came
039190	from
039191	
039192	the ends
039193	
039194	of the earth
039195	to hear
039196	
039197	the wisdom
039198	of Solomon –
039199	
039200	and now,
039201	something greater
039202	than Solomon
039203	is here!
039204	The people
039205	of Nineveh
039206	will stand up
039207	at
039208	
039209	the judgment
039210	with
039211	
039212	this generation
039213	
039214	
039215	and condemn
039216	
039217	
039218	it, because they repented
039219	
039220	
039221	preached
039222	when Jonah
039223	
039224	to them – and now,
039225	something greater
039226	than Jonah
039227	is here!
039228	“No one
039229	a lamp
039230	after lighting
039231	it in
039232	a hidden place
039233	puts
039234	or
039235	under
039236	
039237	a basket,
039238	but
039239	on
039240	
039241	a lampstand,
039242	so that
039243	
039244	those who come in
039245	
039246	the light.
039247	can see
039248

039272	it is
039273

039275	your body
039276	
039277	is full of darkness.

039306	of a lamp

039308	the light

039310	
039311	As
039312	
039313	
039314	he spoke,
039315	invited
039316	
039317	a Pharisee
039318	Jesus to
039319	have a meal
039320	with him,
039321	
039322	he went in
039323	so
039324	and took his place at the table.
039325	
039326	
039327	The Pharisee
039328	when he saw
039329	was astonished
039330	
039331	that Jesus did not
039332	first
039333	wash
039334	his hands before
039335	
039336	the meal.
039337	said
039338	But
039339	
039340	the Lord
039341	to him,
039342	
039343	“Now you
039344	
039345	
039346	Pharisees
039347	
039348	the outside
039349	
039350	of the cup
039351	
039352	
039353	and the plate,
039354	clean
039355	
039356	but
039357	inside
039358	
039359	you are full
039360	of greed
039361	
039362	and wickedness.
039363	You fools!
039364	Didn’t
039365	
039366	the one who made
039367	
039368	the outside
039369	
039370	
039371	the inside as well?
039372	make
039373	But
039374	
039375	from your heart
039376	give
039377	to those in need,
039378	
039379	and then
039380	everything
039381	clean for you.
039382	
039383	will be
039384	“But
039385	woe to you
039386	
039387	
039388	Pharisees!
039389	
039390	You give a tenth

039392	of your mint,
039393	
039394	
039395	rue,
039396	
039397	and every
039398	herb,
039399	
039400	yet you neglect
039401	
039402	justice
039403	
039404	
039405	and love
039406	
039407	for God!
039408	
039409	But
039410	you should
039411	have done
039412	the others.
039413	these things without
039414	neglecting
039415	Woe to you
039416	
039417	
039418	Pharisees!
039419	
039420	You love
039421	
039422	the best seats
039423	in
039424	
039425	the synagogues
039426	
039427	
039428	and elaborate greetings
039429	in
039430	
039431	the marketplaces!
039432	Woe
039433	
039434	
039435	to you! You are
039436	like
039437	
039438	graves,
039439	
039440	unmarked
039441	
039442	
039443	and people
039444	
039445	walk
039446	over
039447	them without
039448	realizing it!”
039449	
039450	
039451	One
039452	
039453	of the experts in religious law
039454	answered him,
039455	
039456	“Teacher,
039457	
039458	when you say
039459	
039460	
039461	these things you insult us too.”
039462	
039463	But
039464	Jesus replied,
039465	
039466	
039467	
039468	experts in religious law
039469	“Woe to you
039470	
039471	as well! You load
039472	
039473	people down
039474	with burdens
039475	difficult to bear,
039476	
039477	
039478	with even one
039479	
039480	of your fingers!
039481	
039482	yet you yourselves refuse
039483	to touch
039484	
039485	the burdens
039486	Woe
039487	
039488	
039489	to you! You build
039490	
039491	the tombs
039492	
039493	of the prophets
039494	
039495	
039496	whom your ancestors
039497	
039498	killed.
039499	
039500	So
039501	you testify
039502	
039503	
039504	that you approve
039505	
039506	of the deeds
039507	
039508	of your ancestors,
039509	
039510	
039511	
039512	
039513	because they killed
039514	
039515	
039516	the prophets and
039517	you build their tombs!
039518	For
039519	
039520	
039521	
039522	this reason also the wisdom
039523	
039524	of God
039525	said,
039526	‘I will send them
039527	
039528	
039529	prophets
039530	
039531	and apostles,
039532	
039533	some of
039534	
039535	whom they will kill
039536	
039537	and persecute,’
039538	so that
039539	may be held accountable
039540	
039541	for the blood
039542	of all
039543	
039544	the prophets
039545	
039546	that has been shed
039547	since
039548	the beginning
039549	of the world,
039550	
039551	
039552	this generation
039553	
039554	from
039555	the blood
039556	of Abel
039557	to
039558	the blood
039559	of Zechariah,
039560	
039561	who was killed
039562	between
039563	
039564	the altar
039565	
039566	
039567	and the sanctuary.
039568	Yes,
039569	I tell you,
039570	
039571	it will be charged
039572	against
039573	
039574	this generation.
039575	
039576	Woe to you
039577	
039578	
039579	experts in religious law!
039580	
039581	You have taken away
039582	
039583	the key
039584	
039585	to knowledge!
039586	
039587	You did not
039588	go in
039589	
039590	
039591	those who were going in.”
039592	yourselves, and you hindered
039593	from there,
039594	When he went out
039595	
039596	began
039597	
039598	the experts in the law
039599	
039600	
039601	and the Pharisees
039602	bitterly,
039603	to oppose him
039604	
039605	and to ask him hostile questions
039606	
039607	about
039608	many things,
039609	plotting against him,
039610	
039611	to catch
039612	something
039613	him in
039614	
039615	he might say.
039616	
039617	Meanwhile,
039618	
039619	had gathered
039620	
039621	when many thousands
039622	
039623	of the crowd
039624	so that
039625	they were trampling on
039626	one another,
039627	Jesus began
039628	to speak
039629	to
039630	
039631	his disciples,
039632	
039633	first
039634	“Be on
039635	your guard
039636	against
039637	
039638	the yeast
039639	which
039640	is
039641	hypocrisy.
039642	
039643	of the Pharisees,
039644	Nothing
039645	
039646	hidden
039647	is
039648	that
039649	will not
039650	be revealed,
039651	
039652	and nothing is secret
039653	that
039654	will not
039655	be made known.
039656	So then
039657	and what
039658	whatever
039659	in
039660	
039661	the dark
039662	you have said
039663	in
039664	
039665	the light,
039666	will be heard
039667	
039668	
039669	
039670	
039671	
039672	you have whispered
039673	in
039674	
039675	private room
039676	s will be proclaimed
039677	from
039678	
039679	the housetops.
039680	“I tell you,
039681	
039682	
039683	
039684	my friends,
039685	
039686	do not
039687	be afraid
039688	of
039689	
039690	those who kill
039691	
039692	the body,

039696	nothing
039697	that have
039698	more
039699	
039700	they can do.
039701	I will warn you
039702	But
039703	
039704	whom
039705	you should fear:
039706	Fear
039707	
039708	the one who, after
039709	
039710	the killing,
039711	has
039712	authority
039713	to throw
039714	you into
039715	
039716	hell.
039717	Yes,
039718	I tell you,
039719	
039720	
039721	fear him!
039722	Aren’t
039723	five
039724	sparrows
039725	sold
039726	pennies?
039727	for two
039728	
039729	one
039730	of them
039731	
039732	Yet not
039733	is
039734	forgotten
039735	before
039736	
039737	God.
039738	In fact,
039739	
039740	
039741	even the hairs
039742	
039743	on your head
039744	
039745	are all
039746	numbered.
039747	Do not
039748	be afraid;
039749	than many
039750	sparrows.
039751	you are more valuable
039752	“I tell you,
039753	
039754	
039755	
039756	whoever
039757	
039758	acknowledges me
039759	
039760	
039761	before
039762	
039763	men,
039764	
039765	
039766	the Son
039767	
039768	of Man
039769	will also acknowledge
039770	
039771	
039772	before
039773	
039774	angels.
039775	
039776	God’s
039777	
039778	But
039779	the one who denies me
039780	
039781	before
039782	
039783	men
039784	will be denied
039785	before
039786	
039787	angels.
039788	
039789	God’s
039790	
039791	And everyone
039792	who
039793	speaks
039794	a word
039795	against
039796	
039797	the Son
039798	
039799	of Man
039800	will be forgiven,
039801	
039802	
039803	but
039804	against
039805	
039806	the Holy
039807	Spirit
039808	the person who blasphemes
039809	will not
039810	be forgiven.
039811	when
039812	But
039813	they bring you
039814	
039815	before
039816	
039817	the synagogues,
039818	
039819	
039820	the rulers,
039821	
039822	
039823	and the authorities,
039824	do not
039825	worry
039826	about how
039827	
039828	
039829	you should make your defense
039830	or
039831	what
039832	you should say,
039833	
039834	for
039835	the Holy
039836	Spirit
039837	will teach you
039838	
039839	at
039840	
039841	
039842	that moment
039843	what
039844	you must
039845	say.”
039846	tell
039847	Then
039848	someone
039849	from
039850	
039851	the crowd
039852	
039853	“Teacher,
039854	said to him,
039855	
039856	my brother
039857	
039858	to divide
039859	with me.”
039860	
039861	
039862	the inheritance
039863	
039864	But
039865	Jesus said to him,
039866	
039867	“Man,
039868	who
039869	
039870	made me
039871	a judge
039872	or
039873	arbitrator
039874	between you two?”
039875	
039876	he said
039877	Then
039878	to them,
039879	
039880	“Watch out
039881	
039882	and guard
039883	yourself from
039884	all types of
039885	greed,
039886	
039887	does not
039888	in
039889	
039890	the abundance
039891	
039892	
039893	because one’s life
039894	
039895	consist
039896	of
039897	
039898	his possessions.”
039899	
039900	
039901	He then
039902	a parable:
039903	
039904	
039905	told them
039906	man
039907	of a certain
039908	rich
039909	produced an abundant crop,
039910	
039911	“The land
039912	
039913	so he thought
039914	to
039915	himself,
039916	
039917	‘What
039918	should I do,
039919	
039920	nowhere
039921	for I have
039922	
039923	to store
039924	
039925	my crops?’
039926	
039927	
039928	Then he said,
039929	
039930	‘I will do this:
039931	I will tear down
039932	
039933	
039934	my barns
039935	
039936	bigger ones,
039937	and build
039938	
039939	I will store
039940	and there
039941	all
039942	
039943	my grain
039944	
039945	
039946	and my goods.
039947	
039948	
039949	And I will say
039950	
039951	to myself,
039952	
039953	
039954	“You have
039955	plenty
039956	of goods
039957	stored up
039958	for
039959	years;
039960	many
039961	relax,
039962	eat,
039963	drink,
039964	celebrate!”’
039965	said to him,
039966	But
039967	
039968	
039969	God
039970	‘You fool!
039971	
039972	
039973	This very night
039974	
039975	your life
039976	
039977	will be demanded back
039978	from you,
039979	
039980	who
039981	but
039982	you have prepared for yourself?’
039983	what
039984	will get
039985	So
039986	it is with the one who
039987	stores up riches
039988	for himself,
039989	
039990	but is not
039991	toward
039992	God.”
039993	rich
039994	Jesus said
039995	Then
039996	to
039997	
039998	his disciples,
039999	
040000	
040001	“Therefore
040002	do not
040003	
040004	I tell you,
040005	worry
040006	
040007	about your life,
040008	what
040009	you will eat,
040010	or
040011	
040012	about your body,
040013	what
040014	you will wear.
040015	
040016	For
040017	to life
040018	more
040019	there is
040020	
040021	than food,
040022	
040023	
040024	and more to the body
040025	
040026	than clothing.
040027	Consider
040028	
040029	the ravens:
040030	
040031	They do not
040032	sow
040033	or
040034	reap,
040035	they
040036	no
040037	have
040038	storeroom
040039	or
040040	barn,
040041	
040042	
040043	yet God
040044	feeds them.
040045	
040046	How much
040047	more
040048	
040049	valuable are you
040050	
040051	than the birds!
040052	which
040053	And
040054	of
040055	
040056	you by worrying
040057	can
040058	to
040059	
040060	his life?
040061	
040062	add
040063	an hour
040064	if
040065	So
040066	
040067	do such a very little thing
040068	you cannot
040069	as this, why
040070	about
040071	
040072	the rest?
040073	do you worry
040074	Consider
040075	
040076	the flowers
040077	how
040078	grow;
040079	they do not
040080	work
040081	or
040082	spin.
040083	I tell you,
040084	Yet
040085	
040086	not even
040087	Solomon
040088	in
040089	all
040090	
040091	his glory
040092	
040093	was clothed
040094	like
040095	one of these!
040096	
040097	if
040098	And
040099	
040100	the wild
040101	
040102	grass,
040103	which is
040104	here today
040105	
040106	and tomorrow
040107	into
040108	the fire to heat the oven,
040109	is tossed
040110	
040111	God
040112	this is how
040113	clothes
040114	how much
040115	more
040116	will he clothe you
040117	you people of little faith!
040118	
040119	
040120	So do not
040121	be overly concerned about
040122	what
040123	you will eat
040124	
040125	and what
040126	you will drink,
040127	
040128	and do not
040129	worry about such things.
040130	
040131	For
040132	all
040133	
040134	the nations
040135	
040136	of the world
040137	pursue
040138	
040139	these things, and
040140	
040141	your Father
040142	knows
040143	
040144	that you need them.
040145	
040146	Instead,
040147	pursue
040148	
040149	his kingdom,
040150	
040151	
040152	
040153	and these things will be given
040154	to you as well.
040155	“Do not
040156	be afraid,
040157	
040158	little
040159	flock,
040160	
040161	is well pleased
040162	
040163	for your Father
040164	
040165	to give you
040166	
040167	
040168	the kingdom.
040169	Sell
040170	
040171	your possessions
040172	
040173	
040174	and give
040175	to the poor.
040176	Provide
040177	yourselves
040178	purses
040179	that do not
040180	wear out –
040181	a treasure
040182	that never decreases,

040194	For
040195	is,
040196	
040197	your treasure

040199	there
040200	
040201	
040202	your heart
040203	
040204	will be also.

040206	
040207	
040208	
040209	“Get dressed for service
040210	
040211	
040212	and keep your lamps
040213	burning;

040425	the unfaithful.
040426	and assign him

040430	servant
040431	
040432	who knew

040436	his master’s

040443	
040444	
040445	what his master asked
040446	
040447	beating.
040448	will receive a severe
040449	the one who did
040450	But
040451	not

040453	did
040454	and
040455	things worthy
040456	of punishment
040457	beating.
040458	will receive a light
040459	From everyone
040460	
040461	who
040462	has been given
040463	much,
040464	much
040465	will be required,
040466	and from
040467	
040468	
040469	the one who
040470	has been entrusted
040471	with much,
040472	even more
040473	will be asked.
040474	
040475	fire
040476	“I have come
040477	to bring
040478	on
040479	
040480	the earth –
040481	
040482	and how
040483	I wish
040484	
040485	it were already
040486	kindled!
040487	a baptism
040488	
040489	I have
040490	to undergo,
040491	
040492	and how
040493	distressed
040494	I am until
040495	
040496	it is finished!
040497	Do you think
040498	
040499	peace
040500	I have come
040501	to bring
040502	on
040503	
040504	earth?
040505	No,
040506	I tell you,
040507	
040508	but
040509	rather
040510	division!
040511	there will be
040512	For
040513	from
040514	
040515	now on
040516	five
040517	in
040518	one
040519	household
040520	divided,
040521	three
040522	against
040523	two
040524	
040525	and two
040526	against
040527	three.
040528	They will be divided,
040529	father
040530	against
040531	son
040532	
040533	and son
040534	against

040551	and daughter-in-law
040552	against

040555	Jesus also said
040556	
040557	
040558	
040559	to the crowds,
040560	“When
040561	you see
040562	
040563	a cloud
040564	rising
040565	in
040566	the west,
040567	at once,
040568	you say
040569	
040570	‘A rainstorm
040571	is coming,’
040572	
040573	and it does.
040574	
040575	
040576	And when
040577	you see the south wind
040578	blowing,
040579	you say,
040580	
040581	scorching heat,’
040582	‘There will be
040583	
040584	and there is.
040585	You hypocrites!
040586	
040587	the appearance
040588	
040589	of the earth
040590	and
040591	the
040592	sky,
040593	You know how
040594	to interpret
040595	the
040596	present time?
040597	but
040598	
040599	how
040600	can you not
040601	know how
040602	to interpret
040603	why
040604	“And
040605	
040606	for
040607	yourselves
040608	don’t
040609	you judge
040610	
040611	what is right?
040612	As
040613	
040614	you are going
040615	with
040616	
040617	your accuser
040618	
040619	before
040620	the magistrate,
040621	on
040622	
040623	the way,
040624	make
040625	an effort
040626	to settle
040627	with him
040628	
040629	so that he will not
040630	drag you
040631	
040632	before
040633	
040634	the judge,
040635	
040636	
040637	and the judge
040638	
040639	hand
040640	you over
040641	to the officer,
040642	
040643	
040644	and the officer
040645	
040646	throw you
040647	into
040648	prison.
040649	I tell you,
040650	
040651	
040652	you will never
040653	get out
040654	of there
040655	until
040656	
040657	
040658	the very last
040659	cent!”
040660	you have paid
040661	present
040662	Now
040663	there were some
040664	on
040665	
040666	
040667	that occasion
040668	who told him
040669	
040670	about
040671	
040672	the Galileans
040673	whose
040674	
040675	blood
040676	Pilate
040677	had mixed
040678	with
040679	
040680	their sacrifices.
040681	
040682	
040683	He answered them,
040684	
040685	
040686	“Do you think
040687	
040688	
040689	these Galileans
040690	
040691	worse sinners
040692	than
040693	all
040694	
040695	the other Galileans,
040696	were
040697	
040698	
040699	because they suffered these things?
040700	No,
040701	I tell you!
040702	
040703	But
040704	
040705	unless
040706	you repent,
040707	you will all
040708	as well!
040709	perish
040710	Or
040711	those
040712	who
040713	eighteen
040714	on
040715	them,
040716	fell
040717	
040718	when the tower
040719	in
040720	
040721	Siloam
040722	
040723	were killed
040724	
040725	do you think
040726	
040727	
040728	worse offenders
040729	they were
040730	than
040731	all
040732	
040733	the others
040734	
040735	who live in
040736	Jerusalem?
040737	No,
040738	I tell you!
040739	
040740	But
040741	
040742	unless
040743	you repent
040744	you will all
040745	as well!”
040746	perish
040747	Jesus told
040748	Then
040749	
040750	
040751	this parable:
040752	a fig tree
040753	had
040754	“A man
040755	planted
040756	in
040757	
040758	his vineyard,
040759	
040760	
040761	and he came
040762	looking for
040763	fruit
040764	on
040765	
040766	
040767	none.
040768	it and found
040769	he said
040770	So
040771	to
040772	
040773	the worker who tended the vineyard,
040774	
040775	‘For three
040776	years
040777	
040778	
040779	now, I have come
040780	looking for
040781	fruit
040782	on
040783	
040784	this fig tree,
040785	
040786	
040787	none.
040788	and each time I inspect it I find
040789	Cut
040790	
040791	it down!
040792	Why
040793	
040794	
040795	the soil?’
040796	should it continue to deplete
040797	
040798	But
040799	the worker answered him,
040800	
040801	
040802	‘Sir,
040803	alone
040804	leave it
040805	
040806	
040807	
040808	this year
040809	too, until
040810	
040811	I dig
040812	around
040813	
040814	
040815	it and put
040816	fertilizer on it.
040817	Then if
040818	
040819	it bears
040820	fruit
040821	
040822	
040823	next year,
040824	if
040825	very well, but
040826	not,
040827	
040828	you can cut
040829	it down.’”
040830	he was
040831	Now
040832	teaching
040833	in
040834	one
040835	
040836	of the synagogues
040837	on
040838	
040839	the Sabbath,
040840	
040841	was there
040842	and a woman
040843	by a spirit
040844	who had
040845	been disabled
040846	years.
040847	for eighteen
040848	
040849	She was
040850	bent over
040851	
040852	not
040853	and could
040854	straighten herself up
040855	
040856	
040857	completely.
040858	saw her,
040859	
040860	
040861	
040862	When Jesus
040863	he called
040864	
040865	him and said,
040866	her to
040867	“Woman,
040868	you are freed
040869	
040870	from your infirmity.”
040871	
040872	
040873	Then he placed
040874	
040875	
040876	his hands on her,
040877	
040878	and immediately
040879	she straightened up
040880	
040881	and praised
040882	
040883	God.
040884	
040885	But
040886	
040887	the president of the synagogue,
040888	indignant
040889	
040890	
040891	on the Sabbath,
040892	had healed
040893	
040894	because Jesus
040895	said
040896	
040897	to the crowd,
040898	
040899	six
040900	days
040901	“There are
040902	on
040903	which
040904	should
040905	work
040906	on
040907	
040908	be done! So
040909	come
040910	and be healed
040911	
040912	those days, and not
040913	on the
040914	day.”
040915	
040916	Sabbath
040917	answered him,
040918	Then
040919	
040920	
040921	the Lord
040922	
040923	
040924	“You hypocrites!
040925	each of you
040926	
040927	
040928	on the Sabbath
040929	Does not
040930	untie
040931	
040932	his ox
040933	
040934	or
040935	
040936	his donkey
040937	from
040938	
040939	its stall,
040940	
040941	and lead
040942	it to water?
040943	
040944	Then
040945	shouldn’t this woman, a daughter
040946	of Abraham
040947	
040948	whom
040949	bound
040950	
040951	Satan
040952	
040953	
040954	
040955	for eighteen
040956	long years,
040957	
040958	be
040959	released
040960	from
040961	
040962	this imprisonment
040963	
040964	
040965	day?”
040966	
040967	on the Sabbath
040968	
040969	
040970	When he said
040971	
040972	were humiliated,
040973	this all
040974	
040975	his adversaries
040976	
040977	
040978	but the entire
040979	
040980	crowd
040981	was rejoicing
040982	at
040983	all
040984	
040985	the wonderful things
040986	
040987	he was doing.
040988	
040989	
040990	Jesus asked,
040991	Thus
040992	“What
040993	like?
040994	is
040995	
040996	the kingdom
040997	
040998	of God
040999	
041000	To what
041001	should I compare it?
041002	
041003	like
041004	It is
041005	seed
041006	a mustard
041007	that
041008	took
041009	a man
041010	and sowed
041011	in
041012	garden.
041013	his
041014	
041015	It grew
041016	
041017	and became
041018	
041019	a tree,
041020	
041021	
041022	birds
041023	
041024	and the wild
041025	nested
041026	in
041027	
041028	its branches.”
041029	
041030	
041031	Again
041032	he said,
041033	“To what
041034	should I compare
041035	
041036	the kingdom
041037	
041038	of God?
041039	like
041040	It is
041041	yeast
041042	that
041043	took
041044	a woman
041045	and mixed
041046	with
041047	of flour
041048	measures
041049	three
041050	until
041051	the dough
041052	had risen.”
041053	all
041054	
041055	Then Jesus traveled
041056	throughout
041057	towns
041058	
041059	and villages,
041060	teaching
041061	
041062	his way
041063	and making
041064	toward
041065	Jerusalem.
041066	asked him,
041067	
041068	Someone
041069	
041070	“Lord,
041071	will only
041072	a few
041073	
041074	be saved?”
041075	
041076	So
041077	he said
041078	to them,
041079	
041080	“Exert every effort
041081	to enter
041082	through
041083	
041084	the narrow
041085	door,
041086	
041087	because many,
041088	I tell you,
041089	
041090	will try
041091	to enter
041092	
041093	and will not
041094	be able to.
041095	
041096	Once
041097	
041098	gets up
041099	
041100	the head of the house
041101	
041102	and shuts
041103	
041104	the door,
041105	
041106	and start
041107	outside
041108	then you will stand
041109	
041110	to knock
041111	
041112	on the door
041113	and beg
041114	him, ‘Lord, let us
041115	in!’
041116	
041117	
041118	But he will answer you,
041119	
041120	
041121	‘I don’t
041122	know
041123	
041124	where
041125	you come from.’
041126	Then
041127	you will begin
041128	to say,
041129	‘We ate
041130	presence,
041131	in your
041132	
041133	and drank
041134	
041135	in
041136	
041137	our streets.’
041138	
041139	and you taught
041140	
041141	
041142	But he will reply,
041143	
041144	‘I don’t
041145	know
041146	
041147	where
041148	you come from!
041149	Go away
041150	from me,
041151	
041152	all
041153	
041154	you evildoers!’
041155	There
041156	will be
041157	
041158	weeping
041159	
041160	
041161	and gnashing
041162	
041163	of teeth
041164	when
041165	you see
041166	Abraham,
041167	
041168	Isaac,
041169	
041170	Jacob,
041171	
041172	and all
041173	
041174	the prophets
041175	in
041176	
041177	the kingdom
041178	
041179	of God
041180	
041181	but
041182	you yourselves thrown
041183	out.
041184	
041185	Then people will come
041186	from
041187	east
041188	
041189	and west,
041190	
041191	and from
041192	north
041193	
041194	and south,
041195	
041196	and take their places at the banquet table
041197	in
041198	
041199	the kingdom
041200	
041201	of God.
041202	
041203	But indeed,
041204	some are
041205	last
041206	who
041207	will be
041208	first,
041209	
041210	and some are
041211	first
041212	who
041213	will be
041214	last.”
041215	At
041216	
041217	
041218	that time,
041219	came up
041220	some
041221	Pharisees
041222	and said
041223	
041224	to Jesus, “Get away
041225	
041226	
041227	from here,
041228	
041229	because Herod
041230	wants
041231	
041232	to kill you.”
041233	
041234	But he said to them,
041235	
041236	“Go
041237	and tell
041238	
041239	that fox,
041240	
041241	‘Look,
041242	I am casting out
041243	demons
041244	
041245	healings
041246	and performing
041247	today
041248	
041249	and tomorrow,
041250	
041251	
041252	and on the third
041253	day I will complete my work.
041254	Nevertheless
041255	I must
041256	
041257	my way today
041258	
041259	and tomorrow
041260	
041261	
041262	and the next day,
041263	go on
041264	
041265	
041266	because it is impossible
041267	that a prophet
041268	should be killed
041269	outside
041270	Jerusalem.’
041271	O Jerusalem,
041272	Jerusalem,
041273	
041274	you who kill
041275	
041276	the prophets
041277	
041278	and stone
041279	
041280	those who are sent
041281	to
041282	
041283	you! How often
041284	I have longed
041285	to gather
041286	
041287	your children
041288	
041289	
041290	together as
041291	a hen
041292	
041293	gathers her
041294	chicks
041295	under
041296	
041297	her wings,
041298	
041299	none of it!
041300	but you would have
041301	Look,
041302	is forsaken!
041303	
041304	
041305	your house
041306	
041307	I tell you,
041308	And
041309	
041310	
041311	you will not
041312	see me
041313	
041314	until
041315	
041316	
041317	you say,
041318	‘Blessed
041319	
041320	is the one who comes
041321	in
041322	the name
041323	of the Lord!’”
041324	
041325	
041326	
041327	
041328	when Jesus went
041329	
041330	at
041331	the house
041332	
041333	
041334	of a leader
041335	
041336	of the Pharisees,
041337	Now one Sabbath
041338	to dine
041339	
041340	
041341	
041342	they were
041343	watching him closely.
041344	
041345	
041346	There right
041347	was a man
041348	
041349	whose body was
041350	swollen with fluid.
041351	in front of him
041352	
041353	
041354	
041355	
041356	So Jesus
041357	asked
041358	
041359	
041360	the experts in religious law
041361	
041362	and the Pharisees,
041363	
041364	“Is it lawful
041365	
041366	on the Sabbath
041367	to heal
041368	or
041369	not?”
041370	
041371	But
041372	they remained silent.
041373	
041374	So Jesus took hold
041375	of the man, healed him,
041376	
041377	
041378	and sent him away.
041379	
041380	to them,
041381	
041382	Then he said
041383	“Which of you,
041384	
041385	if you have a son
041386	or
041387	an ox
041388	into
041389	a well
041390	that has fallen
041391	
041392	will not
041393	immediately
041394	pull
041395	him out?”
041396	on
041397	day,
041398	
041399	a Sabbath
041400	
041401	not
041402	But they could
041403	reply
041404	to this.
041405	
041406	he told them
041407	Then
041408	to them,
041409	
041410	the guests
041411	a parable.
041412	when Jesus noticed
041413	how
041414	
041415	the places of honor,
041416	chose
041417	He said
041418	
041419	
041420	“When
041421	you are invited
041422	by
041423	someone
041424	to
041425	a wedding feast,
041426	do not
041427	take
041428	
041429	
041430	the place of honor,
041431	because
041432	a person more distinguished
041433	
041434	than you may have been
041435	invited
041436	by your host.
041437	
041438	
041439	of you will come
041440	
041441	
041442	
041443	both
041444	So the host who invited
041445	and say to you,
041446	
041447	‘Give
041448	
041449	this man your place.’
041450	
041451	Then,
041452	you will begin
041453	
041454	ashamed,
041455	
041456	to the least important
041457	place.
041458	to move
041459	But
041460	when
041461	you are invited,
041462	go
041463	and take
041464	
041465	
041466	the least important
041467	place,
041468	so that
041469	when
041470	approaches
041471	
041472	your host
041473	
041474	he will say to you,
041475	
041476	‘Friend,
041477	move up
041478	here to a better place.’
041479	Then
041480	you will be
041481	
041482	honored
041483	in the presence
041484	of all
041485	
041486	who share the meal with you.
041487	
041488	
041489	For everyone
041490	
041491	who exalts
041492	himself
041493	will be humbled,
041494	
041495	
041496	but the one who humbles
041497	himself
041498	will be exalted.”
041499	He said
041500	
041501	
041502	
041503	also to the man who had invited him,
041504	
041505	“When
041506	you host
041507	a dinner
041508	or
041509	a banquet,
041510	don’t
041511	invite
041512	
041513	your friends
041514	
041515	or
041516	
041517	your brothers
041518	
041519	or
041520	
041521	your relatives
041522	
041523	or
041524	neighbors
041525	rich
041526	so
041527	
041528	by them in return
041529	you can be invited
041530	
041531	
041532	and get
041533	repaid.
041534	
041535	But
041536	when
041537	an elaborate meal,
041538	you host
041539	invite
041540	the poor,
041541	the crippled,
041542	the lame,
041543	and the blind.
041544	
041545	blessed,
041546	Then you will be
041547	
041548	because they cannot
041549	
041550	repay you,
041551	
041552	you will be repaid
041553	for
041554	
041555	at
041556	
041557	the resurrection
041558	
041559	of the righteous.”
041560	with Jesus heard this,
041561	
041562	When one
041563	
041564	of those at the meal
041565	
041566	he said to him,
041567	
041568	“Blessed
041569	is everyone who
041570	will feast
041571	
041572	in
041573	
041574	the kingdom
041575	
041576	of God!”
041577	
041578	But
041579	Jesus said to him,
041580	
041581	“A man
041582	
041583	once gave
041584	banquet
041585	a great
041586	
041587	and invited
041588	many guests.
041589	
041590	he sent
041591	
041592	his slave
041593	
041594	
041595	At the time
041596	
041597	for the banquet
041598	to tell
041599	
041600	those who had been invited,
041601	‘Come,
041602	
041603	now
041604	ready.’
041605	because everything is
041606	
041607	began
041608	
041609	But one
041610	after another they all
041611	to make excuses.
041612	
041613	The first
041614	said to him,
041615	
041616	a field,
041617	‘I have bought
041618	
041619	
041620	and I must
041621	go out
041622	and see
041623	
041624	
041625	
041626	
041627	
041628	it. Please excuse me.’
041629	
041630	Another
041631	said,
041632	yoke
041633	of oxen,
041634	‘I have bought
041635	five
041636	
041637	and I am going out
041638	to examine them.
041639	
041640	
041641	
041642	
041643	
041644	Please excuse me.’
041645	
041646	Another
041647	said,
041648	
041649	‘I just got married,
041650	
041651	
041652	
041653	
041654	and I cannot
041655	come.’
041656	
041657	came back
041658	
041659	So the slave
041660	and reported
041661	
041662	this to his master.
041663	
041664	
041665	Then
041666	was furious
041667	
041668	the master of the household
041669	and said
041670	
041671	to his slave,
041672	
041673	‘Go out
041674	quickly
041675	to
041676	
041677	the streets
041678	
041679	and alleys
041680	
041681	of the city,
041682	
041683	
041684	the poor,
041685	
041686	the crippled,
041687	
041688	the blind,
041689	
041690	and the lame.’
041691	and bring in
041692	
041693	
041694	said,
041695	
041696	Then the slave
041697	‘Sir,
041698	has been done,
041699	what
041700	you instructed
041701	
041702	still
041703	room.’
041704	and there is
041705	
041706	said
041707	
041708	So the master
041709	to
041710	
041711	his slave,
041712	‘Go out
041713	to
041714	
041715	the highway
041716	
041717	s and country roads
041718	
041719	and urge
041720	people to come in,
041721	so that
041722	will be filled.
041723	
041724	
041725	my house
041726	I tell you,
041727	For
041728	
041729	
041730	not one
041731	
041732	individuals
041733	of those
041734	
041735	who were invited
041736	will taste
041737	
041738	
041739	my banquet!’”
041740	were accompanying
041741	Now
041742	
041743	crowds
041744	large
041745	
041746	Jesus, and turning
041747	he said,
041748	to them
041749	
041750	“If
041751	anyone
041752	comes
041753	to me

041796	
041797	
041798	cannot

041804	of you,
041805	
041806	wanting
041807	a tower,
041808	to build
041809	doesn’t
041810	first
041811	sit down
041812	and compute
041813	
041814	the cost
041815	to see if
041816	he has
041817	enough money to
041818	complete it?
041819	
041820	Otherwise,
041821	when he has laid

041829	
041830	who see

041832	
041833	to make fun of him.
041834	They will say,
041835	
041836	
041837	
041838	‘This man
041839	began
041840	to build
041841	
041842	and was not
041843	able
041844	to finish!’
041845	Or
041846	what
041847	king,
041848	going out
041849	another
041850	king
041851	to confront
041852	in
041853	battle,
041854	will not
041855	sit down
041856	first
041857	and determine
041858	whether
041859	able
041860	he is
041861	with
041862	ten
041863	thousand
041864	to oppose
041865	
041866	with
041867	twenty
041868	thousand?
041869	the one coming
041870	against him
041871	
041872	If
041873	
041874	he cannot
041875	
041876	still
041877	
041878	a long way off
041879	while the other is
041880	a representative
041881	succeed, he will send
041882	and ask for
041883	
041884	terms of
041885	peace.
041886	In the same way
041887	therefore
041888	one
041889	of
041890	
041891	if he
041892	not
041893	renounce
041894	all
041895	
041896	his own
041897	possessions.
041898	does not
041899	you can
041900	be
041901	
041902	my disciple
041903	is good,
041904	
041905	
041906	“Salt
041907	if
041908	but
041909	
041910	
041911	salt
041912	loses its flavor,
041913	
041914	how
041915	can its flavor be restored?
041916	of no
041917	for
041918	the soil
041919	or
041920	for
041921	the manure pile;
041922	value
041923	It is
041924	out.
041925	to be thrown
041926	it is
041927	
041928	The one who has
041929	ears
041930	to hear
041931	had better listen!”
041932	were
041933	Now
041934	
041935	coming
041936	all
041937	
041938	the tax collectors
041939	
041940	
041941	and sinners
041942	to hear him.
041943	
041944	
041945	were complaining,
041946	
041947	
041948	But the Pharisees
041949	
041950	
041951	and the experts in the law
041952	
041953	
041954	
041955	sinners
041956	“This man welcomes
041957	
041958	and eats with them.”
041959	
041960	
041961	So
041962	
041963	
041964	
041965	this parable:
041966	
041967	Jesus told them
041968	“Which
041969	one
041970	of you,
041971	
041972	if he has
041973	a hundred
041974	sheep
041975	
041976	and loses
041977	of them,
041978	
041979	one
041980	would not
041981	leave
041982	
041983	the ninety-
041984	nine
041985	in
041986	
041987	the open pasture
041988	
041989	and go
041990	look for
041991	
041992	the one that is lost
041993	until
041994	he finds it?
041995	
041996	
041997	Then when he has found
041998	it, he places
041999	it on
042000	
042001	his shoulders,
042002	
042003	rejoicing.
042004	
042005	Returning
042006	
042007	
042008	home,
042009	he calls together
042010	
042011	his friends
042012	
042013	
042014	and neighbors,
042015	telling them,
042016	
042017	‘Rejoice with me,
042018	
042019	
042020	because I have found
042021	
042022	my sheep
042023	
042024	
042025	that was lost.’
042026	I tell you,
042027	
042028	
042029	in the same way
042030	more joy
042031	in
042032	
042033	heaven
042034	there will be
042035	over
042036	one
042037	sinner
042038	who repents
042039	than
042040	over
042041	ninety-
042042	nine
042043	righteous people
042044	who
042045	no
042046	need
042047	have
042048	to repent.
042049	“Or
042050	what
042051	woman,
042052	silver coins
042053	she has
042054	ten
042055	if
042056	and loses
042057	
042058	one
042059	of them, does not
042060	light
042061	a lamp,
042062	
042063	sweep
042064	
042065	the house,
042066	
042067	and search
042068	thoroughly
042069	until
042070	
042071	she finds it?
042072	
042073	Then when she has found
042074	it, she calls together
042075	
042076	her friends
042077	
042078	and neighbors,
042079	saying,
042080	‘Rejoice with me,
042081	
042082	
042083	for I have found
042084	
042085	the coin
042086	that
042087	I had lost.’
042088	In the same way,
042089	I tell you,
042090	
042091	there is
042092	joy
042093	in the presence of
042094	
042095	angels
042096	
042097	God’s
042098	over
042099	one
042100	sinner
042101	who repents.”
042102	Jesus said,
042103	Then
042104	“A man
042105	
042106	had
042107	two
042108	sons.
042109	
042110	said
042111	
042112	The younger of them
042113	
042114	
042115	to his father,
042116	‘Father,
042117	give me
042118	
042119	
042120	that will belong to me.’
042121	the share
042122	
042123	of the estate
042124	
042125	So
042126	he divided
042127	
042128	
042129	his assets between them.
042130	
042131	After
042132	
042133	a few
042134	days,
042135	gathered together
042136	all
042137	
042138	the younger
042139	son
042140	he had and left on a journey
042141	to
042142	country,
042143	a distant
042144	
042145	and there
042146	he squandered
042147	
042148	his wealth
042149	
042150	lifestyle.
042151	with a wild
042152	after he had spent
042153	Then
042154	
042155	everything,
042156	took place
042157	famine
042158	a severe
042159	in
042160	
042161	country,
042162	that
042163	
042164	
042165	and he began
042166	to be in need.
042167	
042168	So he went
042169	and worked for
042170	one
042171	
042172	of the citizens
042173	
042174	country,
042175	of that
042176	
042177	who sent him
042178	
042179	to
042180	
042181	his fields
042182	
042183	to feed
042184	pigs.
042185	
042186	He was longing
042187	to eat
042188	
042189	
042190	the carob pods
042191	
042192	were eating,
042193	
042194	the pigs
042195	
042196	but no one
042197	gave him anything.
042198	
042199	to
042200	his senses
042201	But
042202	when he came
042203	he said,
042204	‘How many
042205	hired workers
042206	
042207	of my father’s
042208	
042209	enough to spare,
042210	have food
042211	
042212	but
042213	from hunger!
042214	here
042215	I am dying
042216	I will get up
042217	and go
042218	to
042219	
042220	my father
042221	
042222	
042223	and say to him,
042224	
042225	“Father,
042226	I have sinned
042227	against
042228	
042229	heaven
042230	
042231	and against you.
042232	
042233	no longer
042234	I am
042235	worthy
042236	to be called
042237	your son;
042238	
042239	treat me
042240	
042241	like
042242	one
042243	
042244	of your hired workers.”’
042245	
042246	
042247	So he got up
042248	and went
042249	to
042250	
042251	father.
042252	his
042253	still
042254	But
042255	
042256	a long way
042257	while he was
042258	saw him,
042259	
042260	
042261	from home his father
042262	
042263	
042264	and his heart went out to
042265	
042266	him; he ran
042267	and hugged
042268	
042269	
042270	his son
042271	
042272	
042273	and kissed him.
042274	
042275	said to him,
042276	Then
042277	
042278	his son
042279	
042280	‘Father,
042281	I have sinned
042282	against
042283	
042284	heaven
042285	
042286	and against you;
042287	
042288	no longer
042289	I am
042290	worthy
042291	to be called
042292	your son.’
042293	
042294	said
042295	But
042296	
042297	the father
042298	to
042299	
042300	his slaves,
042301	
042302	‘Hurry!
042303	Bring
042304	robe,
042305	
042306	the best
042307	
042308	and put
042309	it on him!
042310	
042311	Put
042312	a ring
042313	on
042314	
042315	his finger
042316	
042317	
042318	and sandals
042319	on
042320	
042321	his feet!
042322	
042323	Bring
042324	
042325	calf
042326	
042327	the fattened
042328	and kill
042329	
042330	it! Let us eat
042331	and celebrate,
042332	
042333	
042334	
042335	because this son
042336	
042337	dead,
042338	of mine was
042339	
042340	and is alive again –
042341	he was
042342	lost
042343	
042344	and is found!’
042345	
042346	So they began
042347	to celebrate.
042348	was
042349	“Now
042350	
042351	son
042352	
042353	
042354	his older
042355	in
042356	the field.
042357	
042358	As
042359	he came
042360	and approached
042361	
042362	the house,
042363	he heard
042364	music
042365	
042366	and dancing.
042367	
042368	So he called
042369	one
042370	
042371	of the slaves
042372	and asked
042373	what
042374	
042375	was happening.
042376	
042377	
042378	The
042379	slave replied,
042380	
042381	
042382	
042383	‘Your brother
042384	
042385	has returned,
042386	
042387	has killed
042388	
042389	and your father
042390	
042391	
042392	calf
042393	
042394	the fattened
042395	
042396	safe and sound.’
042397	his son back
042398	because he got
042399	the older son became angry
042400	But
042401	
042402	
042403	and refused
042404	to go in.
042405	
042406	
042407	His father
042408	
042409	came out
042410	and appealed to him,
042411	
042412	
042413	but
042414	he answered
042415	
042416	
042417	his father,
042418	
042419	‘Look!
042420	These many
042421	years
042422	I have worked like a slave
042423	
042424	
042425	and I never
042426	your commands.
042427	
042428	disobeyed
042429	
042430	gave me
042431	Yet you never
042432	for you,
042433	even a goat
042434	so that
042435	with
042436	
042437	my friends!
042438	
042439	I could celebrate
042440	when
042441	But
042442	
042443	this son
042444	
042445	
042446	
042447	who has devoured
042448	
042449	
042450	your assets
042451	with
042452	prostitutes,
042453	of yours came back,
042454	you killed
042455	
042456	
042457	the fattened
042458	calf for him!’
042459	
042460	Then
042461	the father said to him,
042462	
042463	‘Son,
042464	
042465	always
042466	with me,
042467	
042468	you are
042469	
042470	and everything
042471	
042472	that belongs to me
042473	yours.
042474	is
042475	to celebrate
042476	
042477	
042478	and be glad,
042479	It was appropriate
042480	
042481	
042482	for your brother
042483	
042484	
042485	dead,
042486	was
042487	
042488	and is alive;
042489	
042490	he was lost
042491	
042492	and is found.’”
042493	Jesus also said
042494	
042495	
042496	to
042497	
042498	the disciples,
042499	
042500	
042501	“There was
042502	a rich man
042503	who
042504	
042505	that his manager
042506	
042507	
042508	was informed of accusations
042509	
042510	
042511	was wasting
042512	
042513	his assets.
042514	
042515	
042516	So he called
042517	
042518	the manager in and said to him,
042519	
042520	‘What
042521	
042522	is this I hear
042523	about
042524	
042525	you? Turn in
042526	
042527	the account
042528	
042529	of your administration,
042530	
042531	no
042532	because
042533	you can
042534	longer
042535	be my manager.’
042536	said
042537	Then
042538	
042539	to himself,
042540	
042541	the manager
042542	‘What
042543	should I do,
042544	
042545	
042546	since my master
042547	
042548	is taking
042549	
042550	my position away
042551	from me?
042552	
042553	to dig,
042554	I’m not
042555	strong enough
042556	to beg.
042557	and I’m too ashamed
042558	I know
042559	what
042560	to do
042561	so that
042562	when
042563	I am put out

042587	
042588	my master?’
042589	
042590	
042591	
042592	The man replied,
042593	‘A hundred
042594	measures
042595	of olive oil.’
042596	
042597	
042598	The manager said
042599	
042600	to him, ‘Take

042605	sit down

042609	Then
042610	to another,

042613	‘And
042614	how much
042615	do you owe?’
042616	
042617	
042618	The manager said to him,
042619	The second man replied, ‘A hundred

043248	everything
043249	
043250	you were commanded
043251	
043252	to do, should say,
043253	
043254	slaves
043255	undeserving
043256	‘We are
043257	what
043258	was our duty.’”
043259	of special praise; we have only done
043260	
043261	
043262	
043263	Now on
043264	
043265	the way
043266	to
043267	Jerusalem,
043268	
043269	
043270	Jesus was passing along
043271	between
043272	
043273	Samaria
043274	
043275	and Galilee.
043276	
043277	As he was entering
043278	
043279	
043280	
043281	a village,
043282	met him.
043283	
043284	ten
043285	with leprosy
043286	men
043287	They
043288	stood
043289	at a distance,
043290	
043291	
043292	raised
043293	their voices
043294	and said,
043295	“Jesus,
043296	Master,
043297	have mercy on us.”
043298	
043299	
043300	When he saw them
043301	he said,
043302	
043303	“Go
043304	and show
043305	yourselves
043306	
043307	to the priests.”
043308	
043309	
043310	And as
043311	
043312	they went along,
043313	
043314	they were cleansed.
043315	Then one
043316	
043317	of them,
043318	
043319	when he saw
043320	
043321	he was healed,
043322	turned back,
043323	with
043324	voice.
043325	a loud
043326	praising
043327	
043328	God
043329	
043330	He fell
043331	with
043332	his face
043333	to the ground at
043334	
043335	Jesus’ feet
043336	
043337	and thanked him.
043338	
043339	
043340	
043341	(Now he was
043342	a Samaritan.)
043343	
043344	Then
043345	
043346	Jesus
043347	said,
043348	“Were not
043349	
043350	ten
043351	cleansed?
043352	
043353	
043354	are the other nine?
043355	Where
043356	Was no
043357	one found
043358	to turn back
043359	and give
043360	praise
043361	
043362	to God
043363	
043364	except
043365	
043366	this foreigner?”
043367	
043368	
043369	Then he said
043370	
043371	to the man, “Get up
043372	and go
043373	
043374	your way. Your faith
043375	
043376	has made
043377	you well.”
043378	asked
043379	Now
043380	
043381	
043382	at one point the Pharisees
043383	Jesus when
043384	was coming,
043385	
043386	the kingdom
043387	
043388	of God
043389	so he answered,
043390	
043391	
043392	
043393	is not
043394	coming
043395	
043396	“The kingdom
043397	
043398	of God
043399	with
043400	signs to be observed,
043401	nor
043402	will they say,
043403	‘Look,
043404	here
043405	it is!’ or
043406	‘There!’
043407	indeed,
043408	For
043409	
043410	the kingdom
043411	
043412	of God
043413	in
043414	your midst.”
043415	is
043416	he said
043417	Then
043418	to
043419	
043420	the disciples,
043421	are coming
043422	“The days
043423	when
043424	you will desire
043425	one
043426	
043427	of the days
043428	
043429	of the Son
043430	
043431	of Man,
043432	to see
043433	and
043434	you will not
043435	see it.
043436	
043437	Then people will say to you,
043438	
043439	‘Look,
043440	there he is!’
043441	or
043442	‘Look,
043443	here he is!’
043444	Do not
043445	go out
043446	or
043447	chase after them.
043448	just like
043449	For
043450	
043451	the lightning
043452	flashes
043453	
043454	
043455	
043456	
043457	the sky
043458	from
043459	one side to
043460	
043461	the other,
043462	and lights up
043463	so
043464	be
043465	
043466	will the Son
043467	
043468	of Man
043469	in
043470	
043471	his day.
043472	
043473	first
043474	But
043475	he must
043476	
043477	many things
043478	suffer
043479	
043480	and be rejected
043481	by
043482	
043483	this generation.
043484	
043485	
043486	Just as
043487	it was
043488	in
043489	
043490	the days
043491	of Noah,
043492	so
043493	too it will be
043494	
043495	in
043496	
043497	the days
043498	
043499	of the Son
043500	
043501	of Man.
043502	People were eating,
043503	they were drinking,
043504	they were marrying,
043505	they were being given in marriage –
043506	right up to
043507	
043508	the day
043509	entered
043510	Noah
043511	
043512	
043513	the ark.
043514	
043515	came
043516	
043517	Then the flood
043518	
043519	and destroyed
043520	them all.
043521	Likewise,
043522	just as
043523	it was
043524	in
043525	
043526	the days
043527	of Lot,
043528	people were eating,
043529	drinking,
043530	buying,
043531	selling,
043532	planting,
043533	building;
043534	
043535	but
043536	on the day
043537	went out
043538	Lot
043539	from
043540	Sodom,
043541	rained down
043542	fire
043543	
043544	and sulfur
043545	from
043546	heaven
043547	
043548	and destroyed
043549	them all.
043550	
043551	
043552	
043553	It will be
043554	
043555	the same on the day
043556	
043557	the Son
043558	
043559	of Man
043560	is revealed.
043561	On
043562	that
043563	
043564	day,
043565	anyone who
043566	is
043567	on
043568	
043569	the roof,
043570	
043571	
043572	with his goods
043573	
043574	in
043575	
043576	the house,
043577	must not
043578	come down
043579	to take
043580	them away,
043581	
043582	
043583	the person in
043584	the field
043585	and likewise
043586	must not
043587	turn
043588	back.
043589	
043590	
043591	Remember
043592	
043593	wife!
043594	Lot’s
043595	Whoever
043596	
043597	tries
043598	
043599	his life
043600	
043601	to keep
043602	will lose it,
043603	
043604	whoever
043605	but
043606	
043607	loses his life
043608	will preserve it.
043609	
043610	I tell you,
043611	
043612	
043613	
043614	in that night
043615	there will be
043616	two
043617	people in
043618	bed;
043619	one
043620	
043621	one
043622	will be taken
043623	
043624	
043625	and the other
043626	left.
043627	There will be
043628	two
043629	women grinding grain
043630	
043631	
043632	together;
043633	
043634	one
043635	will be taken
043636	
043637	and
043638	the other
043639	left.”
043640	
043641	
043642	Then the disciples said to him,
043643	
043644	“Where,
043645	Lord?”
043646	
043647	
043648	He replied to them,
043649	
043650	“Where
043651	
043652	the dead body
043653	is, there
043654	
043655	
043656	the vultures
043657	will gather.”
043658	Jesus told them
043659	Then
043660	a parable
043661	
043662	to show them they
043663	
043664	should
043665	always
043666	pray
043667	
043668	
043669	and not
043670	lose heart.
043671	He said,
043672	a judge
043673	a certain
043674	there was
043675	“In
043676	
043677	city
043678	
043679	God
043680	who neither
043681	feared
043682	
043683	people.
043684	nor
043685	respected
043686	a widow
043687	also
043688	There was
043689	in
043690	
043691	city
043692	that
043693	
043694	who kept coming
043695	to him
043696	
043697	and saying,
043698	‘Give
043699	me justice
043700	against
043701	
043702	my adversary.’
043703	
043704	‘Though
043705	I neither
043706	he refused,
043707	For
043708	a while
043709	later
043710	
043711	but
043712	on he said
043713	to
043714	himself,
043715	
043716	
043717	
043718	God
043719	
043720	fear
043721	nor
043722	for people,
043723	have regard
043724	because
043725	yet
043726	
043727	keeps on
043728	
043729	bothering me,
043730	
043731	this widow
043732	
043733	I will give
043734	her justice,
043735	
043736	or
043737	
043738	in the end
043739	by her unending pleas.’”
043740	she will wear
043741	me out
043742	says!
043743	And
043744	
043745	the Lord
043746	“Listen
043747	to what
043748	
043749	judge
043750	
043751	the unrighteous
043752	said,
043753	
043754	
043755	God
043756	
043757	Won’t
043758	give
043759	
043760	justice
043761	
043762	to his chosen ones,
043763	
043764	
043765	who cry out to him
043766	
043767	day
043768	
043769	and night?
043770	
043771	Will he delay long to help them?
043772	
043773	
043774	I tell you,
043775	
043776	
043777	he will give them
043778	
043779	justice
043780	
043781	
043782	speedily.
043783	Nevertheless,
043784	
043785	when the Son
043786	
043787	of Man
043788	comes,
043789	
043790	will he find
043791	
043792	faith
043793	on
043794	
043795	earth?”
043796	Jesus also told
043797	
043798	
043799	to
043800	some
043801	
043802	who were confident
043803	
043804	
043805	
043806	that they were
043807	righteous
043808	
043809	and looked down
043810	
043811	on everyone else.
043812	
043813	this parable
043814	
043815	men
043816	“Two
043817	went up
043818	to
043819	
043820	the temple
043821	to pray,
043822	
043823	one
043824	a Pharisee
043825	
043826	
043827	and the other
043828	a tax collector.
043829	
043830	The Pharisee
043831	stood
043832	about
043833	himself like this:
043834	
043835	and prayed
043836	
043837	‘God,
043838	I thank
043839	
043840	
043841	not
043842	you that I am
043843	like
043844	
043845	other
043846	
043847	people:
043848	extortionists,
043849	unrighteous people,
043850	adulterers –
043851	or
043852	
043853	even like
043854	
043855	
043856	this tax collector.
043857	I fast
043858	twice
043859	
043860	a week;
043861	I give a tenth
043862	of everything
043863	
043864	I get.’
043865	
043866	however,
043867	The tax collector,
043868	far off
043869	stood
043870	
043871	and would
043872	not even
043873	
043874	look
043875	up
043876	to
043877	
043878	heaven,
043879	but
043880	beat
043881	
043882	his breast
043883	
043884	and said,
043885	
043886	‘God,
043887	be merciful to me,
043888	
043889	
043890	sinner that I am!’
043891	I tell
043892	
043893	you that this man went down
043894	
043895	justified
043896	to
043897	
043898	his home
043899	
043900	rather than
043901	the Pharisee.
043902	
043903	For everyone
043904	
043905	who exalts
043906	himself
043907	will be humbled,
043908	
043909	but
043910	he who humbles
043911	himself
043912	will be exalted.”
043913	people were even bringing
043914	Now
043915	
043916	
043917	
043918	their babies to him
043919	for
043920	
043921	him to touch.
043922	saw
043923	But
043924	
043925	when the disciples it,
043926	they began to scold those who brought them.
043927	
043928	
043929	But
043930	Jesus
043931	called
043932	
043933	for the children, saying,
043934	“Let
043935	
043936	the little children
043937	come
043938	to me
043939	
043940	
043941	and do not
043942	try to stop them,
043943	
043944	
043945	for
043946	to such as these.
043947	belongs
043948	
043949	the kingdom
043950	
043951	of God
043952	the truth,
043953	I tell you
043954	
043955	
043956	whoever
043957	does not
043958	receive
043959	
043960	the kingdom
043961	
043962	of God
043963	like
043964	a child
043965	
043966	will never
043967	enter it.”
043968	
043969	
043970	
043971	asked him,
043972	Now a certain
043973	
043974	leader
043975	
043976	teacher,
043977	“Good
043978	what
043979	must I do
043980	life?”
043981	eternal
043982	to inherit
043983	said to him,
043984	
043985	
043986	
043987	Jesus
043988	“Why
043989	
043990	good?
043991	do you call me
043992	No one
043993	is good
043994	
043995	except
043996	alone.
043997	
043998	God
043999	
044000	the commandments:
044001	You know
044002	‘Do not
044003	commit adultery,
044004	do not
044005	murder,
044006	do not
044007	steal,
044008	do not
044009	give false testimony,
044010	honor
044011	
044012	your father
044013	
044014	
044015	
044016	and mother.’”
044017	
044018	
044019	The man replied,
044020	
044021	all
044022	“I have wholeheartedly obeyed
044023	these laws since
044024	my youth.”
044025	heard
044026	
044027	
044028	When Jesus
044029	this, he said to him,
044030	
044031	still
044032	“One thing you
044033	
044034	lack.
044035	all
044036	
044037	that you have
044038	Sell
044039	
044040	and give
044041	the money to the poor,
044042	
044043	and you will have
044044	treasure
044045	in
044046	
044047	heaven.
044048	
044049	Then come,
044050	follow me.”
044051	
044052	
044053	But
044054	when the man heard
044055	
044056	very sad,
044057	this he became
044058	he was
044059	for
044060	wealthy.
044061	extremely
044062	noticed
044063	
044064	
044065	
044066	When Jesus
044067	
044068	
044069	this, he said,
044070	“How
044071	hard
044072	
044073	
044074	
044075	it is for the rich
044076	to
044077	
044078	the kingdom
044079	
044080	of God!
044081	enter
044082	easier
044083	In fact,
044084	it is
044085	for a camel
044086	through
044087	the eye
044088	of a needle
044089	to go
044090	than
044091	for a rich person
044092	
044093	
044094	the kingdom
044095	
044096	of God.”
044097	to enter
044098	this said,
044099	
044100	
044101	Those who heard
044102	
044103	“Then who
044104	can
044105	be saved?”
044106	
044107	
044108	He replied,
044109	
044110	“What is impossible
044111	for
044112	mere humans
044113	possible
044114	for
044115	
044116	God.”
044117	is
044118	said,
044119	And
044120	
044121	Peter
044122	“Look,
044123	
044124	we have left
044125	
044126	everything we own
044127	to follow you!
044128	
044129	
044130	Then
044131	“I tell you
044132	
044133	the truth,
044134	Jesus said to them,
044135	
044136	
044137	no one
044138	there is
044139	who
044140	has left
044141	home
044142	or
044143	wife
044144	or
044145	brothers
044146	or
044147	parents
044148	or
044149	children
044150	for the sake of
044151	
044152	kingdom
044153	
044154	God’s
044155	who
044156	
044157	will not
044158	receive
044159	many times more
044160	in
044161	
044162	this age –
044163	
044164	
044165	and in
044166	
044167	the age
044168	
044169	to come,
044170	life.”
044171	eternal
044172	Jesus took
044173	Then
044174	
044175	the twelve aside
044176	and said
044177	to
044178	them,
044179	“Look,
044180	we are going up
044181	to
044182	Jerusalem,
044183	
044184	will be accomplished.
044185	and everything
044186	
044187	that is written
044188	by
044189	
044190	the prophets
044191	
044192	about the Son
044193	
044194	of Man
044195	he will be handed over
044196	For
044197	
044198	to the Gentiles;
044199	
044200	he will be mocked,
044201	
044202	mistreated,
044203	
044204	and spat on.
044205	
044206	They will flog him severely
044207	and kill him.
044208	
044209	
044210	
044211	day
044212	
044213	Yet on the third
044214	he will rise again.”
044215	
044216	
044217	none
044218	
044219	But the twelve understood
044220	
044221	
044222	
044223	of these things. This saying
044224	
044225	was hidden
044226	from them,
044227	
044228	
044229	and they did not
044230	grasp
044231	
044232	what Jesus meant.
044233	
044234	
044235	
044236	
044237	As Jesus approached
044238	
044239	
044240	Jericho,
044241	a blind man
044242	
044243	was sitting
044244	by
044245	
044246	the road
044247	begging.
044248	When he heard
044249	
044250	a crowd
044251	going by,
044252	he asked
044253	what
044254	was going on.
044255	
044256	They told him,
044257	
044258	
044259	
044260	“Jesus
044261	
044262	the Nazarene
044263	is passing by.”
044264	
044265	So he called out,
044266	
044267	“Jesus,
044268	Son
044269	of David,
044270	have mercy on me!”
044271	
044272	
044273	
044274	And those who were in front
044275	scolded him
044276	
044277	to get him
044278	to be quiet,
044279	
044280	but
044281	even
044282	more,
044283	he shouted
044284	“Son
044285	of David,
044286	have mercy on me!”
044287	
044288	stopped
044289	So
044290	
044291	Jesus
044292	and ordered
044293	
044294	the beggar to be brought
044295	to him.
044296	
044297	When the man came near,
044298	
044299	
044300	Jesus asked him,
044301	
044302	“What
044303	do you
044304	want
044305	me to do for you?”
044306	
044307	
044308	He replied,
044309	“Lord,
044310	
044311	let me see again.”
044312	
044313	
044314	Jesus
044315	said to him,
044316	
044317	“Receive your sight;
044318	
044319	your faith
044320	
044321	has healed you.”
044322	
044323	
044324	And immediately
044325	he regained his sight
044326	
044327	and followed
044328	
044329	Jesus, praising
044330	
044331	God.
044332	
044333	When all
044334	
044335	the people
044336	saw
044337	it, they too gave
044338	praise
044339	
044340	to God.
044341	
044342	Jesus entered
044343	and was passing through it.
044344	
044345	Jericho
044346	
044347	Now
044348	a man
044349	named
044350	
044351	Zacchaeus was there; he
044352	
044353	
044354	was
044355	a chief tax collector
044356	
044357	
044358	and was rich.
044359	
044360	He was trying
044361	to get a look
044362	
044363	at Jesus,
044364	
044365	but being
044366	
044367	not
044368	man he could
044369	see over
044370	
044371	the crowd.
044372	
044373	
044374	
044375	a short
044376	
044377	
044378	So he ran on ahead
044379	
044380	
044381	
044382	and climbed up
044383	into
044384	a sycamore tree
044385	to
044386	see him,
044387	
044388	
044389	because Jesus
044390	was going to
044391	pass that way.
044392	
044393	And when
044394	came
044395	to
044396	
044397	that place,
044398	he looked up
044399	
044400	Jesus
044401	and said
044402	to him,
044403	
044404	“Zacchaeus,
044405	quickly,
044406	come down
044407	today.”
044408	because
044409	at
044410	
044411	your house
044412	
044413	I must
044414	
044415	stay
044416	
044417	quickly
044418	So he came down
044419	
044420	and welcomed
044421	
044422	Jesus joyfully.
044423	
044424	And when the people saw
044425	it, they all
044426	complained,
044427	
044428	
044429	
044430	who is a sinner.”
044431	a man
044432	“He has gone in
044433	to be the guest of
044434	stopped
044435	But
044436	Zacchaeus
044437	and said
044438	to
044439	
044440	the Lord,
044441	“Look,
044442	
044443	half
044444	
044445	
044446	of my possessions
044447	Lord,
044448	
044449	to the poor,
044450	I now give
044451	
044452	and if
044453	anyone
044454	of anything,
044455	I have cheated
044456	I am paying back
044457	four times as much!”
044458	said
044459	Then
044460	to him,
044461	
044462	
044463	Jesus
044464	
044465	“Today
044466	salvation
044467	
044468	to this household,
044469	
044470	has come
044471	because
044472	
044473	
044474	a son
044475	of Abraham!
044476	he too is
044477	came
044478	For
044479	
044480	the Son
044481	
044482	of Man
044483	to seek
044484	
044485	and to save
044486	
044487	the lost.”
044488	While the people were listening
044489	
044490	
044491	
044492	to these things, Jesus proceeded
044493	to tell
044494	a parable,
044495	because
044496	
044497	near
044498	he was
044499	to Jerusalem,
044500	
044501	
044502	and because they thought
044503	
044504	
044505	immediately.
044506	was going to
044507	
044508	that the kingdom
044509	
044510	of God
044511	appear
044512	he said,
044513	Therefore
044514	
044515	
044516	“A nobleman
044517	went
044518	to
044519	country
044520	a distant
044521	to receive
044522	for himself
044523	a kingdom
044524	
044525	and then return.
044526	he summoned
044527	And
044528	ten
044529	slaves,
044530	of his
044531	gave them
044532	
044533	ten
044534	minas,
044535	
044536	and said
044537	to them,
044538	
044539	‘Do business
044540	
044541	with these until
044542	I come back.’
044543	
044544	But
044545	his citizens
044546	
044547	hated him
044548	
044549	
044550	and sent
044551	a delegation
044552	after him,
044553	
044554	saying,
044555	‘We do not
044556	want
044557	
044558	this man to be king
044559	over
044560	us!’
044561	
044562	
044563	When
044564	
044565	he returned
044566	
044567	after receiving
044568	
044569	the kingdom,
044570	
044571	
044572	he summoned
044573	
044574	
044575	these slaves
044576	
044577	to whom
044578	he had given
044579	
044580	the money.
044581	He wanted to
044582	know
044583	how much
044584	they had earned by trading.
044585	came before
044586	So
044587	
044588	the first one
044589	him and said,
044590	‘Sir,
044591	
044592	your mina
044593	
044594	ten minas
044595	has made
044596	more.’
044597	
044598	And the king said to him,
044599	
044600	‘Well done,
044601	good
044602	slave!
044603	
044604	in
044605	a very small matter,
044606	faithful
044607	been
044608	
044609	you will have authority
044610	Because you have
044611	over
044612	ten
044613	cities.’
044614	
044615	came
044616	
044617	Then the second one
044618	and said,
044619	
044620	your mina
044621	
044622	‘Sir,
044623	has made
044624	five
044625	minas.’
044626	the king said to him,
044627	So
044628	
044629	
044630	
044631	
044632	over
044633	‘And you are to be
044634	five
044635	cities.’
044636	
044637	
044638	Then another
044639	slave came
044640	and said,
044641	‘Sir,
044642	here
044643	
044644	is your mina
044645	
044646	that
044647	
044648	I put away for safekeeping
044649	in
044650	a piece of cloth.
044651	I was afraid of you,
044652	For
044653	
044654	
044655	man.
044656	a severe
044657	because you are
044658	You withdraw
044659	what
044660	you did not
044661	deposit
044662	
044663	and reap
044664	what
044665	you did not
044666	sow.’
044667	The king said to him,
044668	
044669	by
044670	
044671	your own words, you
044672	
044673	‘I will judge you
044674	
044675	wicked
044676	slave!
044677	So you knew,
044678	
044679	
044680	man,
044681	a severe
044682	did you, that I was
044683	withdrawing
044684	what
044685	I didn’t
044686	deposit
044687	
044688	and reaping
044689	what
044690	I didn’t
044691	sow?
044692	
044693	
044694	Why
044695	then didn’t
044696	you put
044697	
044698	
044699	my money
044700	in
044701	the bank,
044702	so that when I
044703	returned
044704	with
044705	interest?’
044706	
044707	
044708	I could have collected it
044709	
044710	
044711	to his attendants,
044712	And he said
044713	‘Take
044714	from him,
044715	
044716	
044717	the mina
044718	
044719	and give
044720	
044721	
044722	ten.’
044723	
044724	it to the one who has
044725	
044726	But they said to him,
044727	
044728	‘Sir,
044729	he has
044730	ten
044731	minas already!’
044732	‘I tell you
044733	
044734	
044735	that everyone
044736	
044737	who has
044738	will be given
044739	from
044740	more, but
044741	
044742	the one who does not
044743	have,
044744	
044745	even what
044746	he has
044747	will be taken away.
044748	But
044749	
044750	as for these enemies
044751	
044752	
044753	
044754	of mine who did not
044755	want me
044756	
044757	to be
044758	
044759	their king,
044760	bring them
044761	here
044762	
044763	and slaughter them
044764	
044765	in front of me!’”
044766	
044767	
044768	After Jesus had said
044769	
044770	this, he continued on
044771	ahead,
044772	going up
044773	to
044774	Jerusalem.
044775	
044776	
044777	Now when
044778	he approached
044779	
044780	Bethphage
044781	
044782	and Bethany,
044783	at
044784	
044785	the Mount
044786	
044787	the place called
044788	of Olives,
044789	he sent
044790	two
044791	
044792	of the disciples,
044793	telling
044794	them, “Go
044795	to
044796	
044797	ahead
044798	the village
044799	
044800	it,
044801	of you. When you enter
044802	you will find
044803	a colt
044804	tied
044805	
044806	there that
044807	
044808	has never
044809	
044810	been ridden.
044811	
044812	Untie
044813	
044814	it and bring it here.
044815	
044816	If
044817	anyone
044818	
044819	asks you,
044820	
044821	‘Why
044822	are you untying
044823	it?’ just
044824	say,
044825	
044826	
044827	‘The Lord
044828	
044829	needs it.’”
044830	
044831	
044832	So
044833	
044834	those who were sent ahead
044835	found
044836	it exactly as
044837	he had told them.
044838	
044839	As they were untying
044840	
044841	
044842	
044843	the colt,
044844	asked them,
044845	
044846	its owners
044847	
044848	
044849	
044850	“Why
044851	are you untying
044852	
044853	that colt?”
044854	
044855	
044856	They replied,
044857	
044858	
044859	“The Lord
044860	
044861	needs it.”
044862	
044863	
044864	Then they brought it
044865	
044866	to
044867	
044868	Jesus,
044869	
044870	threw
044871	
044872	
044873	their cloaks
044874	on
044875	
044876	the colt,
044877	get on it.
044878	
044879	and had Jesus
044880	As he rode along,
044881	
044882	
044883	they spread
044884	
044885	cloaks
044886	their
044887	on
044888	
044889	the road.
044890	As he approached
044891	
044892	
044893	
044894	
044895	
044896	the road leading down
044897	
044898	from the Mount
044899	
044900	of Olives,
044901	began
044902	the whole
044903	
044904	crowd
044905	
044906	of his disciples
044907	to rejoice
044908	and praise
044909	
044910	God
044911	voice
044912	with a loud
044913	for
044914	all
044915	
044916	they had seen:
044917	the mighty works
044918	
044919	“Blessed
044920	
044921	who comes
044922	
044923	is the king
044924	in
044925	the name
044926	of the Lord!
044927	in
044928	heaven
044929	Peace
044930	
044931	and glory
044932	in
044933	the highest!”
044934	
044935	But some
044936	
044937	of the Pharisees
044938	in
044939	
044940	the crowd
044941	said
044942	to him,
044943	
044944	“Teacher,
044945	rebuke
044946	
044947	your disciples.”
044948	
044949	
044950	He answered,
044951	
044952	“I tell you,
044953	
044954	if
044955	
044956	they keep silent,
044957	
044958	the very stones
044959	will cry out!”
044960	
044961	Now when
044962	Jesus approached
044963	and saw
044964	
044965	the city,
044966	he wept
044967	over it,
044968	
044969	saying,
044970	
044971	“If
044972	you had only known
044973	on
044974	
044975	this day,
044976	
044977	
044978	
044979	
044980	even you, the things that make for
044981	peace!
044982	now
044983	But
044984	they are hidden
044985	from
044986	your eyes.
044987	
044988	
044989	will come
044990	For the days
044991	upon you
044992	
044993	
044994	will build
044995	
044996	when your enemies
044997	
044998	an embankment
044999	against you
045000	
045001	and surround
045002	
045003	
045004	you and close in on you
045005	
045006	from every side.
045007	
045008	They will demolish you – you
045009	
045010	
045011	
045012	and your children
045013	
045014	within
045015	
045016	
045017	your walls – and they will not
045018	leave
045019	one stone
045020	on top of
045021	another,
045022	within you
045023	
045024	because
045025	
045026	you did not
045027	recognize
045028	
045029	the time
045030	
045031	of your visitation from God.”
045032	
045033	
045034	Then Jesus entered
045035	
045036	
045037	the temple courts
045038	and began
045039	to drive out
045040	
045041	those who were selling things there,
045042	saying to them,
045043	
045044	“It is written,
045045	
045046	will be
045047	
045048	‘My house
045049	
045050	a house
045051	of prayer,’
045052	
045053	but
045054	
045055	you have turned it
045056	into a den
045057	of robbers!”
045058	
045059	Jesus was
045060	teaching
045061	
045062	
045063	daily
045064	in
045065	
045066	the temple courts.
045067	
045068	The
045069	chief priests
045070	
045071	
045072	and the experts in the law
045073	were seeking
045074	
045075	to assassinate him,
045076	
045077	
045078	and the prominent leaders
045079	
045080	among the people
045081	
045082	but they could not
045083	find
045084	
045085	a way
045086	to do
045087	
045088	the people
045089	it, for
045090	all
045091	hung on
045092	
045093	his words.
045094	
045095	
045096	in
045097	Now one
045098	
045099	day,
045100	as Jesus was teaching
045101	
045102	
045103	the people
045104	
045105	
045106	the temple courts
045107	
045108	and proclaiming the gospel,
045109	came up
045110	
045111	the chief priests
045112	
045113	
045114	and the experts in the law
045115	with
045116	
045117	the elders
045118	
045119	
045120	and said
045121	to him,
045122	
045123	“Tell
045124	
045125	us: By
045126	what
045127	authority
045128	
045129	are you doing
045130	these things? Or
045131	who
045132	is
045133	
045134	it who gave you
045135	
045136	
045137	this authority?”
045138	
045139	He answered them,
045140	
045141	
045142	
045143	
045144	ask you
045145	
045146	“I will also
045147	and you tell me:
045148	
045149	a question,
045150	
045151	
045152	baptism –
045153	John’s
045154	it from
045155	heaven
045156	was
045157	or
045158	from
045159	people?”
045160	
045161	So
045162	they discussed
045163	it with
045164	one another,
045165	saying,
045166	
045167	“If
045168	we say,
045169	‘From
045170	heaven,’
045171	he will say,
045172	
045173	‘Why
045174	did you not
045175	believe him?’
045176	
045177	if
045178	But
045179	we say,
045180	‘From
045181	people,’
045182	the
045183	people
045184	all
045185	will stone us,
045186	
045187	they are convinced
045188	because
045189	was
045190	that John
045191	a prophet.”
045192	
045193	
045194	So they replied
045195	that they did not
045196	know
045197	where it came from.
045198	
045199	
045200	Then Jesus
045201	said to them,
045202	
045203	“Neither
045204	
045205	by
045206	
045207	will I tell you
045208	whose
045209	authority
045210	
045211	I do these things.”
045212	he began
045213	Then
045214	to
045215	
045216	the people
045217	tell
045218	
045219	this parable:
045220	
045221	“A man
045222	
045223	planted
045224	a vineyard,
045225	
045226	leased it
045227	
045228	to tenant farmers,
045229	
045230	and went on a journey
045231	time.
045232	for a long
045233	
045234	When harvest time
045235	came, he sent
045236	to
045237	
045238	the tenants
045239	a slave
045240	so that
045241	
045242	
045243	his portion
045244	
045245	of the crop.
045246	they would give him
045247	
045248	
045249	However,
045250	the tenants
045251	his slave and sent
045252	him away
045253	beat
045254	empty-handed.
045255	
045256	So he sent
045257	another
045258	
045259	slave.
045260	
045261	
045262	this one too,
045263	They beat
045264	
045265	treated him outrageously,
045266	and sent him away
045267	empty-handed.
045268	
045269	still
045270	a third.
045271	So he sent
045272	
045273	
045274	
045275	this one,
045276	They even wounded
045277	and threw him out.
045278	said,
045279	Then
045280	
045281	the owner
045282	
045283	of the vineyard
045284	‘What
045285	should I do?
045286	I will send
045287	
045288	son;
045289	
045290	
045291	my one dear
045292	perhaps
045293	
045294	they will respect him.’
045295	saw him,
045296	But
045297	
045298	
045299	when the tenants
045300	they said
045301	to
045302	one another,
045303	
045304	
045305	‘This is
045306	
045307	the heir;
045308	let’s kill him
045309	
045310	so
045311	
045312	will be ours!’
045313	
045314	the inheritance
045315	
045316	So they threw
045317	him out
045318	of
045319	
045320	the vineyard
045321	and killed
045322	him. What
045323	then
045324	do to them?
045325	
045326	
045327	will the owner
045328	
045329	of the vineyard
045330	He will come
045331	
045332	and destroy
045333	
045334	those tenants
045335	
045336	
045337	and give
045338	
045339	the vineyard
045340	to others.”
045341	When the people heard
045342	
045343	this, they said,
045344	“May this never
045345	happen!”
045346	
045347	But
045348	Jesus looked straight at them
045349	
045350	and said,
045351	what
045352	“Then
045353	is
045354	
045355	the meaning of that which is written:
045356	
045357	‘The stone
045358	
045359	rejected
045360	
045361	the builders
045362	
045363	has become
045364	
045365	
045366	the cornerstone’?
045367	Everyone
045368	
045369	who falls
045370	on
045371	this
045372	
045373	stone
045374	will be broken to pieces,
045375	the one on
045376	whom
045377	and
045378	
045379	it falls
045380	will be crushed.”
045381	
045382	
045383	wanted
045384	
045385	Then the experts in the law
045386	
045387	
045388	and the chief priests
045389	to arrest him
045390	
045391	
045392	
045393	
045394	
045395	
045396	
045397	that very hour,
045398	
045399	But they were afraid
045400	
045401	of the people.
045402	they realized
045403	because
045404	
045405	against them.
045406	
045407	he had told
045408	
045409	this parable
045410	
045411	
045412	Then they watched him carefully
045413	and sent
045414	spies
045415	who pretended
045416	
045417	sincere.
045418	to be
045419	
045420	They wanted to take advantage
045421	
045422	of what he might say
045423	so that
045424	they could deliver
045425	him up
045426	
045427	to the authority
045428	
045429	
045430	and jurisdiction
045431	
045432	of the governor.
045433	
045434	Thus they asked him,
045435	
045436	that you speak
045437	“Teacher,
045438	we know
045439	
045440	correctly,
045441	
045442	
045443	and teach
045444	
045445	no
045446	and show
045447	partiality,
045448	but
045449	in accordance with
045450	the truth.
045451	
045452	the way
045453	
045454	of God
045455	teach
045456	Is it right for us
045457	
045458	to Caesar
045459	the tribute tax
045460	to pay
045461	or
045462	not?”
045463	Jesus perceived
045464	But
045465	
045466	
045467	their deceit
045468	and said
045469	to them,
045470	
045471	“Show me
045472	
045473	a denarius.
045474	Whose
045475	are
045476	image
045477	
045478	and inscription
045479	
045480	
045481	on it?” They said,
045482	“Caesar’s.”
045483	
045484	So
045485	he said
045486	to them,
045487	
045488	“Then
045489	give
045490	
045491	to Caesar
045492	the things that are Caesar’s,
045493	
045494	
045495	
045496	and to God
045497	
045498	the things that are God’s.”
045499	
045500	
045501	Thus they were unable
045502	to trap him with his
045503	
045504	own words.
045505	in the presence
045506	
045507	of the people
045508	
045509	And stunned
045510	by
045511	
045512	his answer,
045513	
045514	they fell silent.
045515	came to him.
045516	Now
045517	some
045518	
045519	Sadducees
045520	
045521	(who contend
045522	resurrection)
045523	no
045524	that there is
045525	
045526	
045527	They asked
045528	him, “Teacher,
045529	Moses
045530	wrote for us
045531	
045532	that if
045533	
045534	a man’s brother
045535	dies
045536	leaving
045537	a wife
045538	
045539	
045540	but no children,
045541	
045542	
045543	must marry
045544	
045545	that man
045546	
045547	
045548	the widow
045549	
045550	and father
045551	children
045552	
045553	for his brother.
045554	
045555	seven
045556	Now
045557	brothers.
045558	there were
045559	
045560	
045561	The first one
045562	married
045563	a woman
045564	and died
045565	without children.
045566	
045567	
045568	The second
045569	
045570	
045571	and then the third
045572	married her,
045573	
045574	in this same way
045575	and
045576	
045577	
045578	all seven
045579	no
045580	leaving
045581	children.
045582	
045583	died,
045584	Finally
045585	
045586	
045587	the woman
045588	died too.
045589	
045590	wife
045591	therefore,
045592	In
045593	
045594	the resurrection,
045595	whose
045596	
045597	be?
045598	will the woman
045599	
045600	For
045601	all seven
045602	had
045603	
045604	married her.”
045605	
045606	said to them,
045607	
045608	
045609	So Jesus
045610	
045611	“The people
045612	
045613	of this age
045614	
045615	marry
045616	
045617	and are given in marriage.
045618	
045619	But
045620	those who are regarded as worthy
045621	
045622	age
045623	in that
045624	to share
045625	
045626	
045627	and in the resurrection
045628	
045629	from
045630	the dead
045631	neither
045632	marry
045633	nor
045634	are given in marriage.
045635	no
045636	In fact,
045637	die,
045638	longer
045639	they can
045640	equal to angels
045641	because
045642	they are
045643	
045644	sons
045645	and are
045646	of God,
045647	
045648	of the resurrection.
045649	sons
045650	since they are
045651	
045652	But
045653	are raised
045654	
045655	that the dead
045656	
045657	even Moses
045658	revealed
045659	in the passage about
045660	
045661	the bush,
045662	where
045663	he calls
045664	the Lord
045665	
045666	the God
045667	of Abraham
045668	
045669	and the God
045670	of Isaac
045671	
045672	and the God
045673	of Jacob.
045674	God
045675	Now
045676	not
045677	he is
045678	of the dead,
045679	but
045680	of the living,
045681	all
045682	for
045683	
045684	live before him.”
045685	
045686	Then
045687	some
045688	
045689	of the experts in the law
045690	answered,
045691	“Teacher,
045692	well!”
045693	you have spoken
045694	they did not
045695	For
045696	dare any longer
045697	to ask him
045698	
045699	anything.
045700	he said
045701	But
045702	to them,
045703	
045704	“How
045705	that the Christ
045706	
045707	is it that they say
045708	is
045709	David’s
045710	son?
045711	
045712	For
045713	David himself
045714	says
045715	in
045716	the book
045717	of Psalms,
045718	said
045719	‘The Lord
045720	to
045721	my lord,
045722	
045723	“Sit
045724	at
045725	my right hand,
045726	
045727	until
045728	
045729	I make
045730	
045731	your enemies

045733	a footstool

045735	for your feet.”’
045736	
045737	If David
045738	then
045739	‘Lord,’
045740	
045741	calls him
045742	
045743	how
045744	
045745	his son?”
045746	can he be
045747	were listening,
045748	
045749	As all
045750	
045751	the people
045752	Jesus said
045753	
045754	to his disciples,
045755	
045756	“Beware
045757	of
045758	
045759	the experts in the law.
045760	
045761	They like
045762	walking around
045763	in
045764	long robes,
045765	
045766	and they love
045767	elaborate greetings
045768	in
045769	
045770	the marketplaces
045771	
045772	and the best seats
045773	in
045774	
045775	the synagogues
045776	
045777	and the places of honor
045778	at
045779	
045780	banquets.
045781	
045782	They devour
045783	
045784	property,
045785	
045786	widows’
045787	
045788	and as a show
045789	make long
045790	prayers.
045791	
045792	They will receive
045793	a more severe
045794	punishment.”
045795	Jesus looked up
045796	and
045797	saw
045798	
045799	putting
045800	into
045801	
045802	the offering box.
045803	
045804	their gifts
045805	
045806	the rich
045807	saw
045808	He also
045809	
045810	widow
045811	a poor
045812	put in
045813	
045814	small copper coins.
045815	two
045816	
045817	“I tell you
045818	the truth,
045819	He said,
045820	
045821	
045822	
045823	widow
045824	
045825	
045826	this poor
045827	more
045828	than all of them.
045829	has put in
045830	they all
045831	For
045832	
045833	out of
045834	
045835	their wealth.
045836	
045837	offered
045838	
045839	
045840	their gifts
045841	
045842	But
045843	she, out of
045844	
045845	her poverty,
045846	
045847	everything
045848	
045849	to live on.”
045850	
045851	she had
045852	put in
045853	
045854	Now while some
045855	were speaking
045856	about
045857	
045858	the temple,
045859	
045860	stones
045861	with beautiful
045862	
045863	and offerings,
045864	how it was adorned
045865	Jesus said,
045866	
045867	“As for these things that
045868	you are gazing at,
045869	will come
045870	the days
045871	
045872	when
045873	not
045874	will be left
045875	one stone
045876	on
045877	another.
045878	
045879	
045880	All will be torn down!”
045881	they asked him,
045882	So
045883	
045884	
045885	“Teacher,
045886	when
045887	
045888	
045889	will these things happen?
045890	
045891	And what
045892	
045893	will be the sign
045894	
045895	that these things are about to
045896	
045897	take place?”
045898	
045899	
045900	He said,
045901	“Watch out
045902	that you are not
045903	misled.
045904	many
045905	For
045906	will come
045907	in
045908	
045909	my name,
045910	
045911	‘I am
045912	
045913	saying,
045914	
045915	
045916	he,’ and, ‘The time
045917	is near.’
045918	Do not
045919	follow them!
045920	
045921	
045922	when
045923	And
045924	you hear
045925	of wars
045926	
045927	and rebellions,
045928	do not
045929	be afraid.
045930	these things must
045931	For
045932	
045933	happen
045934	first,
045935	but
045936	will not
045937	come at once.”
045938	
045939	the end
045940	Then
045941	he said to them,
045942	
045943	will rise up in arms
045944	“Nation
045945	against
045946	nation,
045947	
045948	and kingdom

045956	places,
045957	and famines
045958	
045959	and plagues
045960	There will be
045961	terrifying sights
045962	
045963	
045964	from
045965	heaven.
045966	signs
045967	and great
045968	and there will be
045969	before
045970	But
045971	
045972	all this,
045973	
045974	before
045975	
045976	
045977	they will seize
045978	
045979	
045980	you and persecute you,
045981	handing you over
045982	to
045983	
045984	the synagogues
045985	
045986	and prisons.
045987	You will be brought
045988	
045989	kings
045990	
045991	and governors
045992	because of
045993	
045994	my name.
045995	
045996	This will be a time for you
045997	
045998	to serve
045999	as witnesses.
046000	
046001	Therefore
046002	
046003	
046004	be resolved
046005	
046006	not
046007	to rehearse ahead of time
046008	how to make your defense.
046009	
046010	For
046011	I will give you
046012	
046013	the words
046014	
046015	along with the wisdom
046016	that
046017	none
046018	will be able
046019	to withstand
046020	or
046021	contradict.
046022	
046023	
046024	of your adversaries
046025	
046026	You will be betrayed
046027	
046028	
046029	even by

046041	
046042	You will be
046043	hated
046044	by
046045	everyone

046056	
046057	Yet not
046058	will perish.
046059	By
046060	
046061	your endurance
046062

046197	
046198	Then

046200	
046201	the Son

046204	arriving
046205	in

046211	and great
046212	when these things begin
046213	But
046214	
046215	to happen,
046216	stand up
046217	
046218	and raise

046224	
046225	your redemption
046226	
046227	
046228	Then he told them
046229	a parable:
046230	
046231	“Look at
046232	
046233	the fig tree
046234	
046235	and all
046236	
046237	the other trees.
046238	When
046239	they sprout leaves,
046240	now
046241	you see
046242	for
046243	yourselves
046244	and know
046245	
046246	
046247	near.
046248	
046249	that summer
046250	is
046251	So
046252	
046253	
046254	also you, when
046255	you see
046256	
046257	these things happening,
046258	know
046259	
046260	near.
046261	is
046262	
046263	that the kingdom
046264	
046265	of God
046266	the truth,
046267	I tell you
046268	
046269	
046270	
046271	will not
046272	pass away
046273	
046274	this generation
046275	
046276	until
046277	
046278	all these things
046279	take place.
046280	
046281	Heaven
046282	
046283	
046284	and earth
046285	will pass away,
046286	
046287	but
046288	my words
046289	
046290	
046291	will never
046292	pass away.
046293	be on
046294	“But
046295	your guard
046296	so that
046297	are not weighed down
046298	
046299	
046300	your hearts
046301	with
046302	dissipation
046303	
046304	and drunkenness
046305	
046306	and the worries
046307	of this life,
046308	
046309	close down
046310	upon you
046311	
046312	suddenly
046313	
046314	day
046315	and that
046316	like
046317	a trap.
046318	it will overtake
046319	For
046320	on
046321	all
046322	
046323	who live
046324	
046325	the face
046326	of the whole
046327	
046328	earth.
046329	stay alert
046330	But
046331	at
046332	all
046333	times,
046334	praying
046335	that
046336	you may have strength
046337	to escape
046338	
046339	all
046340	
046341	these things that must
046342	happen,
046343	
046344	and to stand
046345	before
046346	
046347	the Son
046348	
046349	of Man.”
046350	
046351	So
046352	
046353	every day
046354	in
046355	
046356	the temple courts,
046357	Jesus was teaching
046358	
046359	but
046360	at night
046361	he went
046362	and stayed
046363	on
046364	
046365	the Mount
046366	
046367	
046368	of Olives.
046369	
046370	And all
046371	
046372	the people
046373	came
046374	to him
046375	early in the morning
046376	in
046377	
046378	the temple courts.
046379	to listen
046380	to him
046381	was approaching.
046382	Now
046383	
046384	the Feast
046385	
046386	of Unleavened Bread,
046387	
046388	which is called
046389	the Passover,
046390	
046391	were trying to find
046392	
046393	The chief priests
046394	
046395	
046396	and the experts in the law
046397	
046398	some way
046399	to execute
046400	
046401	they were afraid
046402	Jesus, for
046403	
046404	of the people.
046405	entered
046406	Then
046407	Satan
046408	
046409	Judas,
046410	
046411	the one called
046412	Iscariot,
046413	who was
046414	one of
046415	
046416	
046417	
046418	the twelve.
046419	
046420	He went away
046421	and discussed
046422	
046423	with the chief priests
046424	
046425	and officers of the temple guard
046426	
046427	how
046428	to them.
046429	he might betray Jesus, handing
046430	him over
046431	
046432	They were delighted
046433	
046434	and arranged
046435	
046436	money.
046437	to give him
046438	
046439	So Judas agreed
046440	
046441	and began looking for
046442	an opportunity
046443	
046444	to betray
046445	Jesus
046446	when no
046447	crowd was present.
046448	
046449	came,
046450	Then
046451	
046452	the day
046453	
046454	for the feast of Unleavened Bread
046455	on
046456	which
046457	had to
046458	be sacrificed.
046459	
046460	the Passover lamb
046461	
046462	Jesus sent
046463	Peter
046464	
046465	and John,
046466	saying,
046467	“Go
046468	and prepare
046469	
046470	
046471	the Passover for us
046472	to
046473	eat.”
046474	
046475	
046476	They said to him,
046477	
046478	“Where
046479	do you want
046480	us to prepare it?”
046481	
046482	
046483	He said to them,
046484	
046485	“Listen,
046486	when you have entered
046487	
046488	into
046489	
046490	the city,
046491	will meet you.
046492	
046493	a man
046494	a jar
046495	of water
046496	carrying
046497	Follow him
046498	
046499	
046500	
046501	the house
046502	
046503	that
046504	he enters,
046505	
046506	and tell
046507	
046508	the owner
046509	
046510	of the house,
046511	“Where
046512	
046513	
046514	‘The Teacher
046515	says to you,
046516	is
046517	
046518	the guest room
046519	where
046520	
046521	the Passover
046522	with
046523	
046524	my disciples?”’
046525	
046526	I may eat
046527	Then he
046528	
046529	will show you
046530	room upstairs.
046531	a large
046532	furnished
046533	there.”
046534	Make preparations
046535	they went
046536	So
046537	and found things
046538	just as
046539	he had told them,
046540	
046541	
046542	and they prepared
046543	
046544	the Passover.
046545	
046546	Now when
046547	came,
046548	
046549	the hour
046550	Jesus took his place at the table
046551	
046552	
046553	and the apostles
046554	joined him.
046555	
046556	
046557	And he said
046558	to them,
046559	
046560	“I have earnestly
046561	desired
046562	
046563	
046564	this Passover
046565	to eat
046566	with you
046567	
046568	before
046569	
046570	
046571	I suffer.
046572	I tell you,
046573	For
046574	
046575	
046576	
046577	I will not
046578	eat it
046579	
046580	again until
046581	
046582	it is fulfilled
046583	in
046584	
046585	the kingdom
046586	
046587	of God.”
046588	
046589	Then he took
046590	a cup,
046591	and after giving thanks
046592	he said,
046593	“Take
046594	
046595	
046596	this and divide
046597	it among
046598	yourselves.
046599	I tell you
046600	For
046601	
046602	
046603	
046604	on I will not
046605	drink
046606	that from
046607	
046608	now
046609	of
046610	
046611	the fruit
046612	
046613	of the vine
046614	until
046615	
046616	
046617	the kingdom
046618	
046619	of God
046620	comes.”
046621	
046622	Then he took
046623	bread,
046624	and after giving thanks
046625	he broke
046626	
046627	it and gave it to them,
046628	
046629	saying,
046630	
046631	“This is
046632	
046633	my body
046634	
046635	
046636	for you.
046637	
046638	which is given
046639	
046640	Do
046641	this in
046642	
046643	of me.”
046644	remembrance
046645	
046646	
046647	he took the cup
046648	And in the same way
046649	after
046650	
046651	they had eaten,
046652	saying,
046653	
046654	
046655	“This cup
046656	
046657	is the new
046658	covenant
046659	in
046660	
046661	my blood.
046662	
046663	
046664	for you
046665	
046666	that is poured out
046667	“But
046668	look,
046669	
046670	the hand
046671	
046672	of the one who betrays me
046673	
046674	is with me
046675	
046676	on
046677	
046678	the table.
046679	
046680	
046681	For the Son
046682	
046683	
046684	of Man
046685	just as
046686	
046687	it has been determined,
046688	is to go
046689	but
046690	woe
046691	
046692	man
046693	to that
046694	by
046695	whom
046696	he is betrayed!”
046697	
046698	
046699	So they began
046700	to question
046701	
046702	one another
046703	
046704	as to which
046705	
046706	it could possibly be
046707	of them
046708	
046709	
046710	
046711	who would
046712	do this.
046713	also started
046714	
046715	
046716	A dispute
046717	among them
046718	
046719	
046720	over which of them
046721	
046722	regarded
046723	was to be
046724	as the greatest.
046725	
046726	So
046727	Jesus said to them,
046728	
046729	
046730	“The kings
046731	
046732	of the Gentiles
046733	lord it over
046734	them,
046735	and
046736	those
046737	in authority over them
046738	
046739	‘benefactors.’
046740	are called
046741	
046742	
046743	Not
046744	so with you;
046745	instead
046746	
046747	the one who is greatest
046748	among
046749	
046750	you must become
046751	like
046752	
046753	the youngest,
046754	
046755	
046756	and the leader
046757	like
046758	
046759	the one who serves.
046760	who
046761	For
046762	is greater,
046763	the one who
046764	is seated at the table,
046765	or
046766	
046767	the one who serves?
046768	Is it not
046769	the one who
046770	is seated at the table?
046771	
046772	But
046773	
046774	among you
046775	
046776	I am
046777	as
046778	
046779	one who serves.
046780	
046781	
046782	“You are
046783	
046784	the ones who have remained
046785	with me
046786	
046787	in
046788	
046789	my trials.
046790	
046791	Thus I
046792	grant to you
046793	
046794	just as
046795	granted to me,
046796	
046797	
046798	my Father
046799	
046800	a kingdom,
046801	that
046802	you may eat
046803	
046804	and drink
046805	at
046806	
046807	my table
046808	
046809	in
046810	
046811	my kingdom,
046812	
046813	
046814	and you will sit
046815	on
046816	thrones
046817	
046818	the twelve
046819	tribes
046820	judging
046821	
046822	of Israel.
046823	“Simon,
046824	Simon,
046825	pay attention!
046826	
046827	Satan
046828	has demanded
046829	
046830	
046831	to have you all, to sift
046832	you like
046833	
046834	wheat,
046835	
046836	but
046837	I have prayed
046838	for you,
046839	
046840	Simon, that
046841	may not
046842	fail.
046843	
046844	your faith
046845	
046846	
046847	
046848	When
046849	you have turned back,
046850	strengthen
046851	
046852	your brothers.”
046853	
046854	
046855	But
046856	Peter said to him,
046857	
046858	“Lord,
046859	with you
046860	
046861	ready
046862	I am
046863	
046864	both to
046865	prison
046866	
046867	and to
046868	death!”
046869	to go
046870	
046871	
046872	“I tell you,
046873	Jesus replied,
046874	
046875	Peter,
046876	will not
046877	crow
046878	today
046879	the rooster
046880	until
046881	three times
046882	
046883	you have denied
046884	that you know me.”
046885	
046886	Then Jesus said to them,
046887	
046888	“When
046889	I sent
046890	you out
046891	with no
046892	money bag,
046893	
046894	or traveler’s bag,
046895	
046896	or sandals,
046897	you didn’t
046898	anything, did you?”
046899	lack
046900	
046901	
046902	They replied,
046903	“Nothing.”
046904	He said to them,
046905	
046906	
046907	“But
046908	now,
046909	
046910	the one who has
046911	a money bag
046912	must take it,
046913	and likewise
046914	
046915	a traveler’s bag
046916	
046917	
046918	no
046919	too. And the one who has
046920	must sell
046921	
046922	his cloak
046923	
046924	
046925	and buy one.
046926	sword
046927	I tell
046928	For
046929	
046930	
046931	
046932	
046933	you that this scripture
046934	must
046935	be fulfilled
046936	in me,
046937	
046938	
046939	
046940	with
046941	the transgressors.’
046942	‘And he was counted
046943	
046944	For
046945	
046946	what is written about me
046947	
046948	being fulfilled.”
046949	is
046950	
046951	So
046952	they said,
046953	Lord,
046954	“Look,
046955	swords.”
046956	here
046957	are two
046958	
046959	Then
046960	he told them,
046961	
046962	enough.”
046963	“It is
046964	
046965	Then Jesus went out
046966	and made his way,
046967	as
046968	
046969	he customarily
046970	did, to
046971	
046972	the Mount
046973	
046974	of Olives,
046975	followed him.
046976	and
046977	
046978	
046979	
046980	the disciples
046981	When he came
046982	
046983	to
046984	
046985	the place,
046986	he said to them,
046987	
046988	“Pray
046989	that you will not
046990	fall
046991	into
046992	temptation.”
046993	
046994	
046995	He went away
046996	from them
046997	
046998	about
046999	a stone’s
047000	throw,
047001	
047002	down,
047003	
047004	knelt
047005	and prayed,
047006	
047007	“Father,
047008	if
047009	you are willing,
047010	take
047011	
047012	
047013	this cup away
047014	from me.
047015	
047016	Yet
047017	not
047018	
047019	my will
047020	
047021	but
047022	
047023	yours
047024	be done.” [
047025	appeared to him
047026	Then
047027	
047028	an angel
047029	from
047030	heaven
047031	and strengthened him.
047032	
047033	
047034	
047035	And in
047036	his anguish
047037	more earnestly,
047038	he prayed
047039	
047040	
047041	
047042	and his sweat
047043	
047044	was like
047045	drops
047046	of blood
047047	falling
047048	to
047049	
047050	the ground.]
047051	
047052	When he got up
047053	from
047054	
047055	prayer,
047056	he came
047057	to
047058	
047059	the disciples
047060	and found them
047061	sleeping,
047062	
047063	exhausted from
047064	
047065	grief.
047066	
047067	So he said to them,
047068	
047069	“Why
047070	are you sleeping?
047071	Get up
047072	and pray
047073	that
047074	you will not
047075	fall
047076	into
047077	temptation!”
047078	While he was still
047079	
047080	speaking,
047081	suddenly
047082	a crowd appeared,
047083	
047084	
047085	and the man named
047086	Judas,
047087	one
047088	
047089	of the twelve,
047090	was leading them.
047091	
047092	
047093	He walked up
047094	
047095	to Jesus
047096	to kiss him.
047097	
047098	Jesus
047099	But
047100	said to him,
047101	
047102	“Judas,
047103	with a kiss?”
047104	
047105	the Son
047106	
047107	of Man
047108	would you betray
047109	saw
047110	
047111	
047112	When those who were around him
047113	
047114	
047115	what was about to happen,
047116	they said,
047117	“Lord,
047118	
047119	should we use
047120	
047121	our swords?”
047122	
047123	struck
047124	Then one
047125	
047126	of them
047127	
047128	
047129	the high priest’s
047130	
047131	slave,
047132	
047133	cutting off
047134	
047135	ear.
047136	
047137	
047138	his right
047139	said,
047140	But
047141	
047142	Jesus
047143	
047144	“Enough of this!”
047145	
047146	
047147	
047148	And he touched
047149	
047150	the man’s ear
047151	and healed him.
047152	
047153	said
047154	Then
047155	Jesus
047156	to
047157	
047158	who had come out
047159	to get him,
047160	
047161	the chief priests,
047162	
047163	the officers of the
047164	
047165	temple guard,
047166	
047167	and the elders
047168	like
047169	you would against
047170	an outlaw?
047171	“Have you come out
047172	with
047173	swords
047174	
047175	and clubs
047176	Day after
047177	day
047178	when I was
047179	
047180	with you
047181	
047182	in
047183	
047184	the temple courts,
047185	not
047186	you did
047187	
047188	arrest me.
047189	
047190	
047191	But
047192	
047193	this is
047194	
047195	
047196	your hour,
047197	
047198	
047199	and that of the power
047200	
047201	of darkness!”
047202	they arrested
047203	Then
047204	
047205	Jesus, led him away,
047206	
047207	and brought
047208	him into
047209	
047210	house.
047211	
047212	the high priest’s
047213	
047214	But
047215	Peter
047216	was following
047217	at a distance.
047218	When they had made
047219	
047220	a fire
047221	in
047222	the middle
047223	
047224	of the courtyard
047225	
047226	and sat down together,
047227	sat down
047228	
047229	Peter
047230	among them.
047231	
047232	seeing him
047233	Then
047234	
047235	a slave girl,
047236	
047237	as he sat
047238	in
047239	
047240	the firelight,
047241	
047242	stared at him
047243	
047244	and said,
047245	
047246	
047247	with him too!”
047248	
047249	“This man was
047250	
047251	But
047252	Peter denied
047253	
047254	I don’t
047255	know him!”
047256	
047257	it: “Woman,
047258	
047259	later
047260	Then a little
047261	someone else
047262	saw him
047263	
047264	and said,
047265	
047266	
047267	one of them
047268	
047269	“You are
047270	
047271	too.” But
047272	Peter
047273	said,
047274	“Man,
047275	not!”
047276	I am
047277	
047278	And after
047279	about
047280	hour
047281	an
047282	still another
047283	
047284	insisted,
047285	
047286	
047287	“Certainly
047288	
047289	
047290	with him,
047291	
047292	this man was
047293	
047294	because
047295	a Galilean.”
047296	he too is
047297	said,
047298	But
047299	
047300	Peter
047301	“Man,
047302	I don’t
047303	know
047304	what
047305	At that moment,
047306	
047307	you’re talking about!”
047308	while he was still
047309	speaking,
047310	
047311	crowed.
047312	a rooster
047313	
047314	turned
047315	
047316	Then the Lord
047317	and looked straight at
047318	
047319	Peter,
047320	
047321	remembered
047322	
047323	and Peter
047324	
047325	the word
047326	
047327	of the Lord,
047328	how
047329	he had said to him,
047330	
047331	
047332	“Before
047333	a rooster
047334	crows
047335	today,
047336	you will deny me
047337	
047338	three times.”
047339	
047340	And he went
047341	outside
047342	and wept
047343	bitterly.
047344	
047345	
047346	Now the men
047347	
047348	who were holding
047349	Jesus under guard
047350	began to mock him
047351	
047352	and beat him.
047353	
047354	They blindfolded
047355	
047356	him and asked him
047357	
047358	repeatedly, “Prophesy!
047359	Who
047360	
047361	
047362	hit you?”
047363	
047364	
047365	other things
047366	many
047367	reviling him.
047368	They also said
047369	against him,
047370	
047371	
047372	When
047373	came,
047374	day
047375	gathered together,
047376	
047377	the council of the elders
047378	
047379	of the people
047380	the chief priests
047381	both
047382	
047383	and the experts in the law.
047384	
047385	Then they led
047386	Jesus away
047387	to
047388	
047389	their council
047390	
047391	and said,
047392	“If
047393	
047394	you are
047395	
047396	the Christ,
047397	tell us.”
047398	
047399	he said to them,
047400	But
047401	
047402	“If
047403	
047404	I tell you,
047405	
047406	you will not
047407	believe,
047408	if
047409	and
047410	I ask
047411	
047412	you, you will not
047413	answer.
047414	from
047415	
047416	now
047417	But
047418	
047419	
047420	on the Son
047421	
047422	of Man
047423	will be seated
047424	at
047425	the right hand
047426	
047427	of the power
047428	
047429	of God.”
047430	He answered them,
047431	So
047432	they all
047433	
047434	then?”
047435	“Are you
047436	
047437	the Son
047438	
047439	of God,
047440	
047441	
047442	
047443	
047444	that I am.”
047445	
047446	said,
047447	
047448	
047449	“You say
047450	
047451	Then
047452	they said,
047453	“Why
047454	further
047455	
047456	testimony?
047457	do we need
047458	
047459	
047460	We have heard
047461	it ourselves from
047462	
047463	his own lips!”
047464	
047465	
047466	rose up
047467	Then the whole
047468	
047469	group of them
047470	
047471	and brought
047472	
047473	Jesus before
047474	
047475	Pilate.
047476	They began
047477	
047478	to accuse him,
047479	
047480	saying,
047481	
047482	“We found
047483	this man subverting
047484	
047485	our nation,
047486	
047487	
047488	forbidding
047489	the tribute tax
047490	to Caesar
047491	us to pay
047492	
047493	and claiming
047494	that he himself
047495	Christ,
047496	a king.”
047497	is
047498	
047499	So
047500	Pilate
047501	asked
047502	
047503	“You say so.”
047504	
047505	Jesus, “Are you
047506	
047507	the king
047508	
047509	of the Jews?”
047510	
047511	He
047512	replied,
047513	
047514	
047515	
047516	
047517	
047518	Then
047519	Pilate
047520	said
047521	to
047522	
047523	the chief priests
047524	
047525	
047526	and the crowds,
047527	no
047528	“I find
047529	basis for an accusation
047530	against
047531	
047532	this man.”
047533	
047534	
047535	But
047536	they persisted
047537	in saying,
047538	
047539	“He incites
047540	
047541	the people
047542	by teaching
047543	throughout
047544	all
047545	
047546	Judea.
047547	
047548	It started
047549	in
047550	
047551	Galilee
047552	and ended up
047553	here!”
047554	when Pilate
047555	Now
047556	heard
047557	this, he asked
047558	whether
047559	
047560	the man
047561	a Galilean.
047562	was
047563	
047564	When he learned
047565	
047566	from
047567	
047568	jurisdiction,
047569	Herod’s
047570	that he was
047571	he sent
047572	him over
047573	to
047574	Herod,
047575	who also happened to be
047576	
047577	
047578	in
047579	Jerusalem
047580	at
047581	
047582	
047583	that time.
047584	
047585	
047586	When Herod
047587	saw
047588	
047589	Jesus,
047590	glad,
047591	very
047592	he was
047593	for
047594	
047595	he had long
047596	
047597	desired
047598	to see him,
047599	
047600	because
047601	
047602	he had heard
047603	about him
047604	
047605	
047606	and was hoping
047607	some
047608	miraculous sign.
047609	to see him
047610	
047611	
047612	perform
047613	Herod questioned him
047614	So
047615	
047616	at
047617	length;
047618	considerable
047619	Jesus
047620	
047621	no answer.
047622	gave him
047623	
047624	were there,
047625	
047626	
047627	The chief priests
047628	
047629	
047630	and the experts in the law
047631	vehemently
047632	accusing him.
047633	
047634	treated
047635	Even
047636	him with contempt
047637	
047638	
047639	Herod
047640	with
047641	
047642	his soldiers
047643	
047644	
047645	and mocked him.
047646	Then, dressing him in
047647	clothes,
047648	elegant
047649	Herod sent
047650	him back
047651	
047652	to Pilate.
047653	became
047654	
047655	friends
047656	
047657	
047658	Herod
047659	
047660	
047661	and Pilate
047662	
047663	
047664	
047665	That very day
047666	with
047667	each other,
047668	prior
047669	for
047670	
047671	enemies.
047672	to this they had been
047673	
047674	
047675	Pilate
047676	Then
047677	called together
047678	
047679	the chief priests,
047680	
047681	
047682	the leaders,
047683	
047684	
047685	and the people,
047686	and said
047687	to them,
047688	
047689	“You brought me
047690	
047691	
047692	this man
047693	
047694	as
047695	one who was misleading
047696	
047697	the people.
047698	
047699	
047700	
047701	him before you,
047702	
047703	When I examined
047704	I did not
047705	find
047706	
047707	
047708	this man
047709	
047710	guilty
047711	
047712	of anything you accused him of doing.
047713	
047714	
047715	
047716	Neither
047717	did Herod,
047718	he sent him
047719	for
047720	
047721	back to us.
047722	
047723	
047724	Look,
047725	nothing
047726	deserving
047727	death.
047728	
047729	he has done
047730	
047731	flogged
047732	I will therefore
047733	have him
047734	and release him.”
047735	they all shouted out
047736	But
047737	together,
047738	
047739	“Take
047740	this man away!
047741	Release
047742	
047743	
047744	
047745	Barabbas for us!”
047746	a man who
047747	(This was
047748	for
047749	an insurrection
047750	
047751	started
047752	into
047753	
047754	the city,
047755	
047756	and for murder.)
047757	had been thrown
047758	in
047759	
047760	prison
047761	once again
047762	
047763	
047764	Pilate
047765	addressed them
047766	
047767	because he wanted
047768	to release
047769	
047770	Jesus.
047771	
047772	But
047773	they kept on shouting,
047774	
047775	“Crucify,
047776	crucify him!”
047777	
047778	
047779	
047780	A third time
047781	he said
047782	to them,
047783	
047784	What
047785	“Why?
047786	wrong
047787	has he done?
047788	
047789	guilty of no
047790	crime
047791	deserving death.
047792	I have found him
047793	
047794	
047795	flog
047796	I will therefore
047797	
047798	him and release him.”
047799	
047800	But
047801	they were insistent,
047802	shouts
047803	with loud
047804	demanding
047805	
047806	that he be crucified.
047807	
047808	prevailed.
047809	
047810	And their shouts
047811	
047812	
047813	So Pilate
047814	decided
047815	should be granted.
047816	
047817	that their demand
047818	
047819	He released
047820	
047821	
047822	for
047823	insurrection
047824	
047825	and murder.
047826	who had been thrown
047827	in
047828	prison
047829	the man
047830	they asked for,
047831	
047832	But
047833	Jesus over
047834	he handed
047835	
047836	to their will.
047837	
047838	
047839	As
047840	they led
047841	him away,
047842	they seized
047843	Simon
047844	
047845	of Cyrene,
047846	who was coming in
047847	from
047848	the country.
047849	They placed
047850	
047851	
047852	the cross
047853	on his back and made him carry
047854	it behind
047855	
047856	Jesus.
047857	followed him,
047858	
047859	
047860	A great
047861	number
047862	
047863	of the people
047864	
047865	among them women
047866	
047867	and wailing for him.
047868	
047869	who were mourning
047870	
047871	turned
047872	But
047873	to them
047874	
047875	
047876	Jesus
047877	and said,
047878	“Daughters
047879	of Jerusalem,
047880	do not
047881	weep
047882	for me,
047883	
047884	but
047885	for
047886	yourselves
047887	weep
047888	
047889	and for
047890	
047891	your children.
047892	
047893	
047894	For this is certain:
047895	are coming
047896	The days
047897	
047898	that
047899	when they will say,
047900	‘Blessed
047901	
047902	are the barren,
047903	
047904	
047905	the wombs
047906	that
047907	never
047908	bore children,
047909	
047910	and the breasts
047911	
047912	never
047913	nursed!’
047914	Then
047915	they will begin
047916	to say
047917	
047918	to the mountains,
047919	‘Fall
047920	on us!’
047921	
047922	
047923	
047924	and to the hills,
047925	‘Cover us!’
047926	
047927	
047928	For if
047929	
047930	
047931	is green,
047932	when the wood
047933	
047934	such things are done
047935	
047936	
047937	when it is dry?”
047938	what
047939	will happen
047940	were also led away
047941	
047942	
047943	other
047944	criminals
047945	Two
047946	with him.
047947	
047948	to be executed
047949	
047950	So when
047951	they came
047952	to
047953	
047954	the place
047955	
047956	that is called
047957	“The Skull,”
047958	there,
047959	they crucified him
047960	
047961	
047962	
047963	along with the criminals,
047964	one
047965	
047966	on
047967	his right
047968	one
047969	and
047970	on
047971	his left.
047972	
047973	[But
047974	Jesus
047975	said,
047976	“Father,
047977	forgive them,
047978	
047979	they don’t
047980	for
047981	know
047982	what
047983	they are doing.”]
047984	to divide
047985	Then
047986	
047987	his clothes.
047988	
047989	they threw
047990	dice
047991	
047992	also stood
047993	
047994	The people
047995	there watching,
047996	ridiculed
047997	but
047998	
047999	
048000	the leaders
048001	him, saying,
048002	others.
048003	“He saved
048004	Let him save
048005	himself
048006	if
048007	
048008	he is
048009	
048010	the Christ
048011	
048012	of God,
048013	
048014	his chosen one!”
048015	also mocked him,
048016	
048017	
048018	
048019	
048020	The soldiers
048021	coming up
048022	sour wine,
048023	and offering him
048024	
048025	
048026	and saying,
048027	“If
048028	
048029	you are
048030	
048031	the king
048032	
048033	of the Jews,
048034	save
048035	yourself!”
048036	There was
048037	
048038	
048039	also an inscription
048040	over him,
048041	
048042	
048043	“This is the king
048044	
048045	of the Jews.”
048046	
048047	One
048048	
048049	
048050	who was hanging
048051	of the criminals
048052	there railed at him,
048053	
048054	saying,
048055	“Aren’t you
048056	
048057	
048058	
048059	the Christ?
048060	Save
048061	yourself and us!”
048062	
048063	
048064	
048065	But
048066	
048067	the other
048068	rebuked him,
048069	
048070	saying,
048071	“Don’t
048072	you fear
048073	
048074	
048075	God,
048076	
048077	under
048078	the
048079	same sentence
048080	of condemnation?
048081	since you are
048082	
048083	
048084	so,
048085	And we rightly
048086	what we deserve
048087	for
048088	for what
048089	we did,
048090	we are getting
048091	
048092	but
048093	nothing
048094	wrong.”
048095	this man has done
048096	
048097	Then he said,
048098	“Jesus,
048099	remember me
048100	
048101	when
048102	you come
048103	in
048104	
048105	your kingdom.”
048106	
048107	
048108	“I tell you
048109	
048110	the truth,
048111	
048112	And Jesus said to him,
048113	today
048114	with me
048115	
048116	you will be
048117	in
048118	
048119	paradise.”
048120	
048121	It was
048122	now
048123	about
048124	
048125	noon,
048126	
048127	and darkness
048128	came
048129	over
048130	the whole
048131	
048132	land
048133	until
048134	
048135	three in the afternoon,
048136	
048137	because the sun’s
048138	light failed.
048139	was torn
048140	
048141	
048142	curtain
048143	
048144	The temple
048145	in two.
048146	
048147	calling out
048148	voice,
048149	with a loud
048150	
048151	Then Jesus,
048152	said,
048153	“Father,
048154	into
048155	your hands
048156	
048157	I commit
048158	
048159	my spirit!”
048160	
048161	
048162	And
048163	after he said this
048164	he breathed his last.
048165	saw
048166	Now
048167	
048168	when the centurion
048169	
048170	what had happened,
048171	he praised
048172	
048173	God
048174	and said,
048175	“Certainly
048176	
048177	this man
048178	
048179	innocent!”
048180	was
048181	
048182	And all
048183	
048184	that had assembled
048185	the crowds
048186	for
048187	
048188	this spectacle,
048189	
048190	when they saw
048191	
048192	what had taken place,
048193	home beating
048194	
048195	their breasts.
048196	returned
048197	Jesus stood
048198	And
048199	all
048200	
048201	those who knew
048202	
048203	at
048204	a distance,
048205	
048206	and the women
048207	
048208	who had followed him
048209	
048210	from
048211	
048212	Galilee
048213	saw these things.
048214	
048215	
048216	Now there
048217	was a man
048218	named
048219	Joseph
048220	a member of the council,
048221	who was
048222	
048223	man.
048224	a good
048225	
048226	and righteous
048227	
048228	not
048229	(He had
048230	consented
048231	
048232	to their plan
048233	
048234	
048235	and action.)
048236	
048237	He was from
048238	of Arimathea,
048239	town
048240	
048241	the Judean
048242	
048243	and was looking forward
048244	
048245	to the kingdom
048246	
048247	of God.
048248	
048249	He went
048250	
048251	to Pilate
048252	and asked for
048253	
048254	the body
048255	
048256	of Jesus.
048257	
048258	Then he took it down,
048259	wrapped it
048260	
048261	in a linen cloth,
048262	
048263	and placed it
048264	
048265	in
048266	a tomb
048267	cut out of the rock,
048268	where
048269	
048270	been
048271	no one
048272	had yet
048273	buried.
048274	
048275	the day
048276	It was
048277	of preparation
048278	
048279	and the Sabbath
048280	was beginning.
048281	followed,
048282	
048283	
048284	The women
048285	who
048286	had
048287	accompanied
048288	Jesus from
048289	
048290	Galilee
048291	
048292	and they saw
048293	
048294	the tomb
048295	
048296	and how
048297	was laid in it.
048298	
048299	his body
048300	
048301	they returned
048302	Then
048303	and prepared
048304	aromatic spices
048305	
048306	and perfumes.
048307	
048308	
048309	
048310	On the Sabbath
048311	they rested
048312	according to
048313	
048314	the commandment.
048315	
048316	Now
048317	on the first
048318	
048319	day of the week,
048320	at early dawn,
048321	
048322	to
048323	
048324	the tomb,
048325	the women went
048326	taking
048327	
048328	they had prepared.
048329	the aromatic spices
048330	They found
048331	
048332	
048333	that the stone
048334	had been rolled away
048335	from
048336	
048337	the tomb,
048338	when they went in,
048339	but
048340	they did not
048341	find
048342	
048343	the body
048344	
048345	of the Lord
048346	Jesus.
048347	
048348	
048349	While
048350	
048351	they were perplexed
048352	
048353	about this,
048354	
048355	
048356	suddenly
048357	men
048358	two
048359	stood beside them
048360	
048361	in
048362	attire.
048363	dazzling
048364	terribly frightened
048365	
048366	The women were
048367	
048368	
048369	and bowed
048370	
048371	their faces
048372	to
048373	
048374	the ground,
048375	but the men said
048376	to them,
048377	
048378	“Why
048379	do you look for
048380	
048381	the living
048382	among
048383	
048384	the dead?
048385	not
048386	He is
048387	here,
048388	but
048389	has been raised!
048390	Remember
048391	how
048392	he told you,
048393	
048394	still
048395	while he was
048396	in
048397	
048398	Galilee,
048399	
048400	
048401	that the Son
048402	
048403	of Man
048404	
048405	must
048406	be delivered
048407	into
048408	the hands
048409	men,
048410	of sinful
048411	
048412	and be crucified,
048413	
048414	
048415	and on the third
048416	day
048417	rise again.”
048418	
048419	Then the women remembered
048420	
048421	his words,
048422	
048423	
048424	and when they returned
048425	from
048426	
048427	the tomb
048428	they told
048429	
048430	all
048431	
048432	these things to the eleven
048433	
048434	and to all
048435	
048436	the rest.
048437	it was
048438	Now
048439	
048440	Magdalene,
048441	Mary
048442	
048443	Joanna,
048444	
048445	Mary
048446	
048447	the mother of James,
048448	
048449	
048450	and the other women
048451	with them
048452	
048453	who told
048454	these things to
048455	
048456	the apostles.
048457	
048458	
048459	seemed
048460	to them,
048461	
048462	like
048463	pure nonsense
048464	
048465	But these words
048466	
048467	
048468	and they did not believe them.
048469	
048470	
048471	But
048472	Peter
048473	got up
048474	and ran
048475	to
048476	
048477	the tomb.
048478	
048479	He bent down
048480	and saw
048481	
048482	the strips of linen cloth;
048483	only
048484	
048485	then he went home,
048486	
048487	
048488	wondering
048489	
048490	what had happened.
048491	
048492	
048493	two
048494	of them
048495	
048496	
048497	
048498	
048499	Now that very day
048500	were
048501	on their way
048502	to
048503	a village
048504	
048505	
048506	about seven miles
048507	from
048508	Jerusalem.
048509	
048510	called
048511	Emmaus,
048512	
048513	
048514	They were talking
048515	to
048516	each other
048517	about
048518	all
048519	
048520	the things that had happened.
048521	
048522	
048523	
048524	While
048525	
048526	they were talking
048527	
048528	
048529	and debating
048530	
048531	
048532	these things, Jesus himself
048533	approached
048534	and began to accompany them
048535	
048536	
048537	(but
048538	their eyes
048539	
048540	were kept
048541	
048542	from
048543	recognizing him).
048544	
048545	he said
048546	Then
048547	to them,
048548	
048549	“What
048550	
048551	are these matters
048552	
048553	
048554	you are discussing
048555	
048556	
048557	so intently as you walk along?”
048558	
048559	And they stood still,
048560	looking sad.
048561	answered him, “Are you
048562	Then
048563	one
048564	of them, named
048565	Cleopas,
048566	
048567	
048568	
048569	
048570	the only
048571	visitor
048572	to Jerusalem
048573	
048574	who doesn’t
048575	know
048576	
048577	the things that have happened there
048578	in
048579	
048580	
048581	
048582	these days?”
048583	
048584	
048585	He said to them,
048586	
048587	“What things?”
048588	
048589	
048590	they replied,
048591	
048592	
048593	“The things concerning
048594	Jesus
048595	
048596	the Nazarene,”
048597	
048598	proved to be
048599	“a man
048600	a prophet
048601	who, with his powerful
048602	
048603	deeds
048604	
048605	and words,
048606	before
048607	
048608	God
048609	
048610	and all
048611	
048612	the people;
048613	how
048614	and
048615	handed
048616	him over
048617	
048618	our chief priests
048619	
048620	
048621	and leaders
048622	
048623	to be
048624	condemned
048625	to death,
048626	
048627	and crucified him.
048628	
048629	
048630	But
048631	we had hoped
048632	
048633	
048634	that he was
048635	
048636	the one who was going to
048637	redeem
048638	
048639	Israel.
048640	Not only this,
048641	
048642	
048643	
048644	
048645	
048646	but it is now the third
048647	
048648	day
048649	
048650	since
048651	
048652	
048653	these things happened.
048654	
048655	Furthermore,
048656	women
048657	some
048658	of
048659	
048660	our group amazed us.
048661	
048662	They were
048663	early this morning,
048664	at
048665	
048666	the tomb
048667	
048668	and when they did not
048669	find
048670	
048671	his body,
048672	
048673	they came back
048674	and said
048675	
048676	a vision
048677	of angels,
048678	they had seen
048679	who
048680	said
048681	
048682	he was alive.
048683	
048684	went
048685	Then some
048686	
048687	of those who were with us
048688	
048689	to
048690	
048691	the tomb,
048692	
048693	and found
048694	
048695	it just as
048696	
048697	
048698	the women
048699	had said,
048700	
048701	but
048702	they did not
048703	see him.”
048704	
048705	
048706	So he said
048707	to them,
048708	
048709	“You
048710	foolish people –
048711	
048712	how slow
048713	
048714	of heart
048715	
048716	to believe
048717	
048718	all
048719	that
048720	have spoken!
048721	
048722	the prophets
048723	Wasn’t
048724	
048725	it necessary
048726	to suffer
048727	
048728	for the Christ
048729	
048730	these things and enter
048731	into
048732	
048733	his glory?”
048734	
048735	
048736	Then beginning
048737	with
048738	Moses
048739	
048740	
048741	and all
048742	
048743	the prophets,
048744	he interpreted to them
048745	
048746	in
048747	all
048748	
048749	the scriptures.
048750	
048751	the things written about
048752	himself
048753	
048754	So they approached
048755	
048756	
048757	the village
048758	where
048759	they were going.
048760	
048761	
048762	He acted as though
048763	farther,
048764	he wanted to go
048765	
048766	but they urged him,
048767	
048768	
048769	“Stay
048770	with us,
048771	
048772	
048773	getting toward
048774	evening
048775	because it is
048776	
048777	done.”
048778	is almost
048779	
048780	and the day
048781	
048782	So he went in
048783	
048784	to stay
048785	with them.
048786	
048787	
048788	
048789	When
048790	
048791	he had taken
048792	his place at the table
048793	with them,
048794	
048795	he took
048796	
048797	the bread,
048798	blessed
048799	
048800	and broke
048801	it, and gave it to them.
048802	
048803	
048804	At this point
048805	were opened
048806	
048807	their eyes
048808	
048809	and they recognized him.
048810	
048811	
048812	
048813	Then he vanished
048814	sight.
048815	out of
048816	their
048817	
048818	They said
048819	to
048820	each other,
048821	“Didn’t
048822	
048823	our hearts
048824	
048825	burn
048826	
048827	on
048828	
048829	within us while
048830	he was speaking with us
048831	
048832	
048833	
048834	the road,
048835	while
048836	he was explaining
048837	
048838	
048839	the scriptures to us?”
048840	
048841	So they got up
048842	
048843	
048844	
048845	that very hour and returned
048846	to
048847	Jerusalem.
048848	
048849	They found
048850	
048851	
048852	the eleven
048853	and
048854	those
048855	gathered together
048856	with them
048857	and saying,
048858	
048859	has really
048860	risen,
048861	
048862	“The Lord
048863	
048864	and has appeared
048865	to Simon!”
048866	
048867	
048868	Then they told
048869	
048870	what had happened on
048871	
048872	the road,
048873	
048874	and how
048875	they recognized
048876	
048877	
048878	
048879	him when he broke
048880	
048881	the bread.
048882	
048883	
048884	
048885	While they were saying
048886	
048887	these things, Jesus himself stood
048888	among them
048889	
048890	
048891	
048892	and said to them,
048893	
048894	“Peace be with you.”
048895	
048896	they were startled
048897	But
048898	
048899	and terrified,
048900	
048901	thinking
048902	a ghost.
048903	they saw
048904	
048905	Then he said to them,
048906	
048907	“Why
048908	you frightened,
048909	are
048910	
048911	
048912	and why
048913	do doubts
048914	arise
048915	in
048916	
048917	your hearts?
048918	
048919	Look at
048920	
048921	my hands
048922	
048923	
048924	
048925	and my feet; it’s me!
048926	
048927	
048928	
048929	
048930	
048931	Touch me
048932	
048933	
048934	and see;
048935	
048936	a ghost
048937	flesh
048938	
048939	and bones
048940	does not
048941	have
048942	like
048943	
048944	you see
048945	I have.”
048946	
048947	
048948	When he had said
048949	this, he showed them
048950	
048951	
048952	his hands
048953	
048954	
048955	and his feet.
048956	while they still
048957	And
048958	could not believe
048959	
048960	it (because of
048961	
048962	their joy)
048963	
048964	and were amazed,
048965	he said to them,
048966	
048967	“Do you have
048968	anything
048969	to eat?”
048970	here
048971	
048972	So
048973	they gave him
048974	
048975	fish,
048976	of broiled
048977	a piece
048978	
048979	and he took
048980	it in front of them.
048981	
048982	it and ate
048983	he said
048984	Then
048985	to them,
048986	
048987	
048988	
048989	“These are my words
048990	
048991	
048992	that I spoke
048993	to
048994	
048995	still
048996	you while I was
048997	with you,
048998	
048999	
049000	must
049001	be fulfilled.”
049002	that everything
049003	
049004	written
049005	in
049006	
049007	the law
049008	of Moses
049009	
049010	
049011	and the prophets
049012	
049013	and the psalms
049014	about me
049015	
049016	Then
049017	he opened
049018	
049019	
049020	their minds
049021	
049022	so they could understand
049023	
049024	the scriptures,
049025	
049026	and said to them,
049027	
049028	
049029	“Thus
049030	it stands written
049031	would suffer
049032	
049033	that the Christ
049034	
049035	and would rise
049036	from
049037	the dead
049038	
049039	on the third
049040	day,
049041	
049042	would be proclaimed
049043	in
049044	
049045	his name
049046	
049047	and repentance
049048	for
049049	the forgiveness
049050	of sins
049051	to
049052	all
049053	
049054	nations,
049055	beginning
049056	from
049057	Jerusalem.
049058	
049059	You are witnesses of these things.
049060	
049061	
049062	And look,
049063	I
049064	am sending
049065	what
049066	promised.
049067	
049068	Father
049069	my
049070	
049071	you
049072	
049073	But
049074	stay
049075	in
049076	
049077	the city
049078	until
049079	
049080	you have been clothed
049081	from
049082	on high.”
049083	with power
049084	Jesus led them
049085	Then
049086	
049087	out
049088	as far as
049089	
049090	Bethany,
049091	
049092	and lifting up
049093	
049094	his hands,
049095	
049096	he blessed them.
049097	
049098	
049099	
049100	Now during
049101	
049102	the blessing
049103	
049104	
049105	he departed
049106	
049107	
049108	
049109	and was taken up
049110	into
049111	
049112	heaven.
049113	
049114	
049115	So they worshiped him
049116	
049117	and returned
049118	to
049119	Jerusalem
049120	with
049121	joy,
049122	great
049123	
049124	and were
049125	
049126	continually
049127	in
049128	
049129	the temple courts
049130	blessing
049131	
049132	God.
049133	In
049134	the beginning
049135	was
049136	
049137	the Word,
049138	
049139	
049140	and the Word
049141	was
049142	with
049143	
049144	God,
049145	
049146	fully God.
049147	was
049148	
049149	and the Word
049150	
049151	The Word was
049152	in
049153	the beginning.
049154	with
049155	
049156	God
049157	All things
049158	by him,
049159	
049160	were created
049161	
049162	and apart from him
049163	
049164	was created
049165	not one thing
049166	
049167	that
049168	has been created.
049169	In him
049170	
049171	life,
049172	was
049173	
049174	
049175	and the life
049176	was
049177	
049178	the light
049179	
049180	of mankind.
049181	
049182	
049183	And the light
049184	in
049185	
049186	the darkness,
049187	shines on
049188	
049189	
049190	but the darkness
049191	
049192	has not
049193	mastered it.
049194	came,
049195	A man
049196	sent
049197	from
049198	God,
049199	whose name
049200	
049201	was John.
049202	
049203	He came
049204	as
049205	a witness
049206	to
049207	testify
049208	about
049209	
049210	the light,
049211	so that
049212	everyone
049213	might believe
049214	through him.
049215	
049216	not
049217	was
049218	He himself
049219	
049220	the light,
049221	but
049222	he came to
049223	testify
049224	about
049225	
049226	the light.
049227	
049228	
049229	light,
049230	
049231	The true
049232	who
049233	gives light
049234	to everyone,
049235	
049236	was coming
049237	into
049238	
049239	the world.
049240	in
049241	
049242	the world,
049243	He was
049244	
049245	
049246	and the world
049247	by him,
049248	
049249	was created
049250	
049251	
049252	but the world
049253	
049254	did not
049255	recognize him.
049256	to
049257	what
049258	was his own,
049259	He came
049260	but
049261	
049262	own
049263	his
049264	people did not
049265	receive him.
049266	to all
049267	But
049268	who have received him –
049269	
049270	he has given
049271	
049272	the right
049273	children
049274	God’s
049275	to become
049276	
049277	those who believe
049278	in
049279	
049280	his name –
049281	
049282	– children
049283	not
049284	by
049285	human parents
049286	or
049287	by
049288	desire
049289	human
049290	or
049291	by
049292	decision,
049293	a husband’s
049294	but
049295	
049296	God.
049297	born
049298	
049299	
049300	Now the Word
049301	flesh
049302	became
049303	
049304	and took up residence
049305	among us.
049306	
049307	
049308	We saw
049309	
049310	his glory –
049311	
049312	the glory
049313	
049314	of the one and only,
049315	who came from
049316	the Father.
049317	full
049318	of grace
049319	
049320	and truth,
049321	John
049322	testified
049323	about him
049324	
049325	
049326	and shouted out,
049327	I said,
049328	
049329	“This one was
049330	the one about whom
049331	
049332	
049333	after me
049334	
049335	‘He who comes
049336	greater
049337	
049338	is
049339	
049340	before me.’”
049341	
049342	than I am, because he existed
049343	
049344	from
049345	
049346	his fullness
049347	
049348	
049349	For we have all
049350	received
049351	
049352	one gracious gift
049353	after
049354	another.
049355	
049356	
049357	For the law
049358	through
049359	Moses,
049360	was given
049361	
049362	but grace
049363	
049364	
049365	and truth
049366	through
049367	Jesus
049368	Christ.
049369	came about
049370	God.
049371	No one
049372	seen
049373	has ever
049374	The only one,
049375	himself God,
049376	
049377	who is
049378	in
049379	
049380	closest fellowship
049381	
049382	with the Father,
049383	has made God
049384	known.
049385	
049386	
049387	Now this was
049388	
049389	testimony
049390	
049391	John’s
049392	when
049393	sent
049394	
049395	
049396	
049397	the Jewish leaders
049398	from
049399	Jerusalem
049400	priests
049401	
049402	and Levites
049403	to
049404	ask him,
049405	
049406	
049407	“Who
049408	are you?”
049409	
049410	He confessed –
049411	
049412	he did not
049413	deny
049414	
049415	but confessed –
049416	
049417	
049418	not
049419	“I am
049420	
049421	the Christ!”
049422	
049423	So they asked him,
049424	
049425	who
049426	“Then
049427	
049428	you Elijah?”
049429	are you? Are
049430	
049431	He said,
049432	not!”
049433	“I am
049434	
049435	the Prophet?”
049436	“Are you
049437	
049438	
049439	He answered,
049440	“No!”
049441	they said to him,
049442	Then
049443	
049444	“Who
049445	are you?
049446	Tell us so that
049447	an answer
049448	we can give
049449	
049450	to those who sent us.
049451	
049452	What
049453	about
049454	do you say
049455	yourself?”
049456	John said,
049457	
049458	“I am the voice
049459	of one shouting
049460	in
049461	
049462	the wilderness,
049463	‘Make straight
049464	
049465	the way
049466	for the Lord,’
049467	as
049468	said.”
049469	Isaiah
049470	
049471	the prophet
049472	
049473	sent
049474	(Now they had been
049475	from
049476	
049477	the Pharisees.)
049478	
049479	So they asked
049480	John,
049481	
049482	
049483	
049484	“Why are
049485	then
049486	you baptizing
049487	if
049488	you
049489	not
049490	are
049491	
049492	the Christ,
049493	nor
049494	Elijah,
049495	nor
049496	
049497	the Prophet?”
049498	answered them,
049499	
049500	
049501	John
049502	
049503	
049504	“I baptize
049505	with
049506	water.
049507	Among
049508	
049509	you stands
049510	one whom you
049511	
049512	do not
049513	recognize,
049514	
049515	after me.
049516	
049517	who is coming
049518	
049519	not
049520	I am
049521	
049522	worthy
049523	to
049524	untie
049525	
049526	
049527	the strap
049528	
049529	of his sandal!”
049530	
049531	in
049532	Bethany
049533	These things happened
049534	across
049535	
049536	the Jordan
049537	River where
049538	was
049539	
049540	John
049541	baptizing.
049542	
049543	On the next day
049544	John saw
049545	
049546	Jesus
049547	coming
049548	toward him
049549	
049550	
049551	and said,
049552	“Look,
049553	
049554	the Lamb
049555	
049556	of God
049557	
049558	who takes away
049559	
049560	the sin
049561	
049562	of the world!
049563	
049564	This is
049565	the one about
049566	whom
049567	
049568	I said,
049569	‘After me
049570	
049571	comes
049572	a man
049573	who
049574	greater
049575	
049576	is
049577	
049578	before me.’
049579	
049580	than I am, because he existed
049581	I
049582	did not
049583	recognize him,
049584	
049585	but
049586	so that
049587	he could be revealed
049588	
049589	to Israel.”
049590	
049591	
049592	I came
049593	
049594	with
049595	water
049596	baptizing
049597	
049598	testified,
049599	Then John
049600	
049601	
049602	“I saw
049603	
049604	the Spirit
049605	descending
049606	like
049607	a dove
049608	from
049609	heaven,
049610	
049611	and it remained
049612	on him.
049613	
049614	And I
049615	did not
049616	recognize him,
049617	
049618	but
049619	the one
049620	who sent me
049621	
049622	to baptize
049623	with
049624	water
049625	‘The one
049626	
049627	said to me,
049628	on
049629	whom
049630	
049631	you see
049632	
049633	the Spirit
049634	descending
049635	
049636	and remaining –
049637	
049638	
049639	
049640	this is
049641	
049642	the one who baptizes
049643	with
049644	Spirit.’
049645	the Holy
049646	I
049647	have both seen
049648	
049649	and testified
049650	
049651	
049652	that this man is
049653	the
049654	Chosen One
049655	
049656	of God.”
049657	
049658	the next day
049659	Again
049660	was standing
049661	
049662	John
049663	
049664	of
049665	
049666	his disciples.
049667	
049668	there with two
049669	
049670	Gazing at
049671	
049672	Jesus
049673	as he walked by,
049674	he said,
049675	“Look,
049676	
049677	the Lamb
049678	
049679	of God!”
049680	
049681	heard
049682	
049683	When John’s two
049684	disciples
049685	
049686	him say
049687	
049688	this, they followed
049689	
049690	Jesus.
049691	turned around
049692	
049693	
049694	Jesus
049695	
049696	and saw them
049697	
049698	following
049699	and said to them,
049700	
049701	“What
049702	do you want?”
049703	
049704	So
049705	
049706	
049707	“Rabbi”
049708	(which
049709	they said to him,
049710	is translated
049711	Teacher),
049712	“where
049713	are you staying?”
049714	Jesus answered,
049715	
049716	“Come
049717	
049718	and you will see.”
049719	they came
049720	So
049721	
049722	and saw
049723	where
049724	he was staying,
049725	
049726	with him
049727	
049728	and they stayed
049729	
049730	day.
049731	that
049732	o’clock in the afternoon.
049733	Now it was
049734	about
049735	four
049736	was
049737	Andrew,
049738	
049739	the brother
049740	of Simon
049741	Peter,
049742	one
049743	of
049744	
049745	the two
049746	
049747	disciples who heard
049748	
049749	what John
049750	
049751	said and followed Jesus.
049752	
049753	found
049754	
049755	He first
049756	
049757	brother
049758	
049759	his own
049760	Simon
049761	
049762	and told him,
049763	
049764	“We have found
049765	
049766	the Messiah!”
049767	(which
049768	is
049769	translated
049770	Christ).
049771	Andrew brought
049772	
049773	Simon to
049774	
049775	Jesus.
049776	looked at him
049777	
049778	
049779	Jesus
049780	and said,
049781	
049782	“You are
049783	Simon,
049784	
049785	the son
049786	of John.
049787	
049788	You will be called
049789	Cephas”
049790	(which
049791	is translated
049792	Peter).
049793	
049794	On the next day
049795	Jesus wanted
049796	to set out
049797	for
049798	
049799	Galilee.
049800	
049801	He found
049802	Philip
049803	
049804	and said to him,
049805	
049806	
049807	
049808	“Follow me.”
049809	
049810	was
049811	(Now
049812	
049813	Philip
049814	from
049815	Bethsaida,
049816	
049817	
049818	the town
049819	of Andrew
049820	
049821	and Peter.)
049822	found
049823	Philip
049824	
049825	Nathanael
049826	
049827	and told him,
049828	
049829	the one
049830	wrote
049831	Moses
049832	about in
049833	
049834	the law,
049835	
049836	
049837	and the prophets
049838	“We have found
049839	also wrote about – Jesus
049840	the son
049841	
049842	of Joseph.”
049843	
049844	of
049845	Nazareth,
049846	
049847	replied,
049848	
049849	Nathanael
049850	of
049851	Nazareth?”
049852	“Can
049853	anything
049854	good
049855	come out
049856	“Come
049857	
049858	
049859	Philip
049860	replied,
049861	
049862	and see.”
049863	saw
049864	
049865	Jesus
049866	
049867	Nathanael
049868	coming
049869	toward him
049870	
049871	
049872	and exclaimed,
049873	
049874	
049875	“Look,
049876	a true
049877	Israelite
049878	in
049879	whom
049880	deceit!”
049881	no
049882	there is
049883	asked him,
049884	
049885	Nathanael
049886	“How
049887	
049888	do you know me?”
049889	replied,
049890	Jesus
049891	
049892	
049893	
049894	“Before
049895	
049896	
049897	Philip
049898	called you,
049899	when you were
049900	under
049901	
049902	the fig tree,
049903	I saw you.”
049904	
049905	answered him,
049906	
049907	Nathanael
049908	“Rabbi,
049909	
049910	you are
049911	
049912	the Son
049913	
049914	of God;
049915	
049916	the king
049917	you are
049918	
049919	of Israel!”
049920	
049921	Jesus
049922	
049923	said to him,
049924	
049925	
049926	“Because I told you
049927	
049928	
049929	that I saw you
049930	
049931	under
049932	
049933	the fig tree,
049934	do you believe?
049935	greater things than these.”
049936	
049937	You will see
049938	
049939	He continued,
049940	
049941	the solemn
049942	truth –
049943	“I tell all of you
049944	
049945	you will see
049946	
049947	heaven
049948	opened
049949	
049950	
049951	and the angels
049952	
049953	of God
049954	ascending
049955	
049956	and descending
049957	on
049958	
049959	the Son
049960	
049961	of Man.”
049962	
049963	
049964	day
049965	
049966	Now on the third
049967	a wedding
049968	there was
049969	at
049970	Cana
049971	
049972	in Galilee.
049973	
049974	was
049975	
049976	mother
049977	
049978	Jesus’
049979	there,
049980	were also invited
049981	and
049982	
049983	
049984	Jesus
049985	
049986	
049987	and his disciples
049988	
049989	to
049990	
049991	the wedding.
049992	
049993	ran out,
049994	When the wine
049995	said
049996	
049997	mother
049998	
049999	Jesus’
050000	to him,
050001	
050002	wine left.”
050003	no
050004	“They have
050005	
050006	replied,
050007	
050008	
050009	Jesus
050010	why are you
050011	
050012	
050013	
050014	“Woman,
050015	has not yet
050016	come.”
050017	
050018	saying this to me? My time
050019	
050020	told
050021	
050022	His mother
050023	
050024	
050025	the servants,
050026	
050027	“Whatever
050028	
050029	he tells you,
050030	
050031	do it.”
050032	there were
050033	Now
050034	there
050035	stone
050036	water jars
050037	six
050038	for
050039	
050040	ceremonial washing,
050041	
050042	Jewish
050043	
050044	holding
050045	each
050046	gallons.
050047	twenty
050048	or
050049	thirty
050050	told
050051	
050052	
050053	Jesus
050054	the servants, “Fill
050055	
050056	the water jars
050057	with water.”
050058	
050059	So they filled them
050060	
050061	up to
050062	the very top.
050063	
050064	Then he told them,
050065	
050066	draw some out
050067	“Now
050068	and
050069	take
050070	
050071	it to the head steward,”
050072	
050073	and
050074	they did.
050075	When
050076	
050077	tasted
050078	
050079	the head steward
050080	
050081	the water
050082	to wine,
050083	that had been turned
050084	
050085	not
050086	knowing
050087	where
050088	it came from
050089	
050090	(though
050091	the servants
050092	knew),
050093	
050094	who had drawn
050095	
050096	the water
050097	called
050098	
050099	the bridegroom
050100	
050101	he
050102	
050103	and said to him,
050104	
050105	“Everyone
050106	
050107	first,
050108	
050109	the good
050110	wine
050111	serves
050112	
050113	wine when
050114	the guests are drunk.
050115	
050116	and then the cheaper
050117	
050118	You have kept
050119	
050120	the good
050121	wine
050122	until
050123	now!”
050124	
050125	did
050126	this as the first
050127	
050128	of his miraculous signs,
050129	
050130	Jesus
050131	in
050132	Cana
050133	
050134	of Galilee.
050135	
050136	In this way he revealed
050137	
050138	his glory,
050139	
050140	
050141	believed
050142	in him.
050143	
050144	
050145	and his disciples
050146	
050147	After
050148	
050149	this he went down
050150	to
050151	Capernaum
050152	
050153	
050154	
050155	with his mother
050156	
050157	
050158	
050159	and brothers
050160	
050161	
050162	
050163	and his disciples,
050164	
050165	
050166	there
050167	and they stayed
050168	
050169	a few
050170	days.
050171	
050172	near,
050173	was
050174	
050175	feast of Passover
050176	
050177	Now the Jewish
050178	
050179	went up
050180	to
050181	Jerusalem.
050182	
050183	so Jesus
050184	
050185	He found
050186	in
050187	
050188	the temple courts
050189	
050190	those who were selling
050191	oxen
050192	
050193	and sheep
050194	
050195	and doves,
050196	
050197	
050198	and the money changers
050199	sitting at tables.
050200	
050201	So he made
050202	a whip
050203	of
050204	cords
050205	them all
050206	and drove
050207	out of
050208	
050209	the temple courts,
050210	
050211	with
050212	the sheep
050213	
050214	
050215	and the oxen.
050216	
050217	
050218	of the money changers
050219	He scattered
050220	
050221	the coins
050222	
050223	
050224	their tables.
050225	and overturned
050226	
050227	
050228	
050229	the doves
050230	To those who sold
050231	he said,
050232	“Take
050233	these things away
050234	from here!
050235	Do not
050236	make
050237	
050238	house
050239	
050240	my Father’s
050241	
050242	
050243	a marketplace!”
050244	remembered
050245	
050246	His disciples
050247	
050248	
050249	written,
050250	that it was
050251	
050252	“Zeal
050253	
050254	for your house
050255	
050256	will devour me.”
050257	
050258	responded,
050259	So then
050260	
050261	the Jewish leaders
050262	
050263	
050264	
050265	“What
050266	sign
050267	can you show us,
050268	
050269	
050270	
050271	since you are doing these things?”
050272	replied,
050273	Jesus
050274	
050275	
050276	
050277	“Destroy
050278	
050279	this temple
050280	
050281	
050282	and in
050283	three
050284	days
050285	I will raise
050286	it up again.”
050287	said to him,
050288	Then
050289	
050290	the Jewish leaders
050291	for forty-
050292	
050293	six
050294	years,
050295	has been under construction
050296	“This
050297	temple
050298	
050299	
050300	and are you
050301	in
050302	three
050303	days?”
050304	going to raise
050305	it up
050306	Jesus
050307	But
050308	was speaking
050309	about
050310	
050311	the temple
050312	
050313	of his body.
050314	
050315	after
050316	So
050317	he was raised
050318	from
050319	the dead,
050320	remembered
050321	
050322	his disciples
050323	
050324	
050325	
050326	that he had said this,
050327	
050328	and they believed
050329	
050330	the scripture
050331	
050332	
050333	and the saying
050334	that
050335	had spoken.
050336	
050337	Jesus
050338	while
050339	Now
050340	Jesus was
050341	in
050342	
050343	Jerusalem
050344	of
050345	
050346	the Passover,
050347	at
050348	
050349	the Feast
050350	many people
050351	believed
050352	in
050353	
050354	his name
050355	
050356	because they saw
050357	
050358	
050359	the miraculous signs
050360	
050361	he was doing.
050362	
050363	But
050364	Jesus
050365	would not
050366	entrust himself to them,
050367	
050368	
050369	because
050370	
050371	
050372	he knew
050373	all people.
050374	
050375	
050376	He did not
050377	
050378	need
050379	to
050380	anyone
050381	testify
050382	about
050383	
050384	man,
050385	
050386	for
050387	he knew
050388	what
050389	was
050390	in
050391	
050392	man.
050393	who was
050394	Now
050395	a certain man,
050396	
050397	
050398	a Pharisee
050399	Nicodemus,
050400	named
050401	
050402	ruling council,
050403	
050404	a member of the Jewish
050405	
050406	came
050407	to
050408	
050409	Jesus at night
050410	
050411	and said
050412	to him,
050413	“Rabbi,
050414	we know
050415	
050416	from
050417	God.
050418	who has come
050419	that you are a teacher
050420	no one
050421	For
050422	could
050423	
050424	
050425	the miraculous signs
050426	perform
050427	that
050428	
050429	you do
050430	
050431	unless
050432	is
050433	
050434	God
050435	with him.”
050436	
050437	replied,
050438	Jesus
050439	
050440	“I tell you
050441	
050442	the solemn
050443	truth,

050447	unless
050448	
050449	is born
050450	from above,
050451	
050452	he cannot
050453	see
050454	
050455	the kingdom
050456	
050457	of God.”
050458	said
050459	to him,
050460	
050461	
050462	Nicodemus
050463	“How
050464	can
050465	a man
050466	be born
050467	old?
050468

050477	a second time, can he?”
050478	enter
050479	
050480	and be born
050481	answered,
050482	Jesus
050483	the solemn
050484	truth,
050485	“I tell you
050486	
050487	
050488	unless
050489	a person

050504	What is born
050505	of

050507	the flesh
050508	flesh,
050509	is

050511	
050512	and what is born

050517	is
050518	Do not
050519	be amazed
050520	
050521	that I said to you,

050523	‘You must
050524	
050525	all be born
050526	from above.’
050527	The
050528	wind
050529	wherever
050530	it will,
050531	blows
050532	
050533	the
050534	sound
050535	it makes,
050536	and you hear
050537	but

050539	know
050540	where
050541	it comes from
050542	
050543	and where
050544	it is going.
050545	So
050546	it is
050547	with everyone
050548	who is
050549	born
050550	of
050551	the

050553	replied,
050554	Nicodemus
050555	
050556	
050557	
050558	“How
050559	can
050560	
050561	these things be?”
050562	answered,
050563	Jesus
050564	
050565	
050566	
050567	
050568	“Are you
050569	
050570	the teacher
050571	
050572	of Israel
050573	
050574	
050575	and yet you don’t
050576	understand these things?
050577	the solemn
050578	truth,
050579	I tell you
050580	
050581	
050582	about what
050583	we know
050584	we speak
050585	
050586	about what
050587	we have seen,
050588	and testify
050589	
050590	
050591	our testimony.
050592	
050593	but you people do not
050594	accept
050595	If
050596	
050597	you people about earthly things
050598	I have told
050599	
050600	
050601	and you don’t
050602	believe,
050603	how
050604	if
050605	I tell
050606	
050607	
050608	you about heavenly things?
050609	will you believe
050610	
050611	No one
050612	has ascended
050613	into
050614	
050615	heaven
050616	
050617	except
050618	
050619	from
050620	
050621	heaven –
050622	the one who descended
050623	
050624	the Son
050625	
050626	of Man.
050627	
050628	Just as
050629	Moses
050630	lifted up
050631	
050632	the serpent
050633	in
050634	
050635	the wilderness,
050636	so
050637	be lifted up,
050638	must
050639	
050640	the Son
050641	
050642	of Man
050643	so that
050644	everyone
050645	
050646	who believes
050647	in him
050648	
050649	may have
050650	life.”
050651	eternal
050652	this is the way
050653	For
050654	loved
050655	
050656	God
050657	
050658	the world:
050659	so that
050660	
050661	Son,
050662	
050663	his one and only
050664	He gave
050665	
050666	everyone
050667	
050668	who believes
050669	in him
050670	
050671	will not
050672	perish
050673	but
050674	have
050675	life.
050676	eternal
050677	did not
050678	For
050679	send
050680	
050681	God
050682	
050683	his Son
050684	into
050685	
050686	the world
050687	to
050688	condemn
050689	
050690	the world,
050691	but
050692	that
050693	should be saved
050694	
050695	the world
050696	through him.
050697	
050698	
050699	The one who believes
050700	in him
050701	
050702	is not
050703	condemned.
050704	
050705	
050706	The one who does not
050707	believe
050708	already,
050709	has been condemned
050710	
050711	because he has not
050712	believed
050713	in
050714	
050715	the name
050716	
050717	of the one and only
050718	Son
050719	
050720	of God.
050721	
050722	Now
050723	this is
050724	
050725	the basis for judging:
050726	
050727	
050728	that the light
050729	has come
050730	into
050731	
050732	the world
050733	
050734	loved
050735	
050736	and people
050737	rather
050738	
050739	the darkness
050740	than
050741	
050742	the light,
050743	were
050744	because
050745	
050746	evil.
050747	
050748	their deeds
050749	everyone
050750	For
050751	
050752	evil deeds
050753	who does
050754	hates
050755	
050756	the light
050757	
050758	and does not
050759	come
050760	to
050761	
050762	the light,
050763	so that
050764	will not
050765	be exposed.
050766	
050767	their deeds
050768	
050769	
050770	But
050771	the one who practices
050772	
050773	the truth
050774	comes
050775	to
050776	
050777	the light,
050778	so that
050779	it may be plainly evident
050780	
050781	
050782	that his deeds
050783	
050784	in
050785	God.
050786	
050787	have been done
050788	After this,
050789	
050790	came
050791	
050792	Jesus
050793	
050794	
050795	and his disciples
050796	
050797	into
050798	
050799	Judean
050800	territory,
050801	
050802	and there
050803	he spent time
050804	with them
050805	
050806	
050807	and was baptizing.
050808	was
050809	
050810	
050811	
050812	John
050813	also baptizing
050814	at
050815	Aenon
050816	near
050817	
050818	Salim,
050819	
050820	because water
050821	plentiful
050822	was
050823	there,
050824	
050825	and people were coming
050826	
050827	to him and being baptized.
050828	had not yet
050829	(For
050830	been
050831	thrown
050832	into
050833	
050834	prison.)
050835	
050836	John
050837	came about
050838	Now
050839	a dispute
050840	between
050841	
050842	disciples
050843	some of John’s
050844	and
050845	a certain Jew
050846	concerning
050847	ceremonial washing.
050848	
050849	So they came
050850	to
050851	
050852	John
050853	
050854	and said to him,
050855	
050856	“Rabbi,
050857	the one who
050858	was
050859	with you
050860	
050861	on the other side
050862	
050863	of the Jordan
050864	River, about whom
050865	
050866	you testified –
050867	see,
050868	
050869	he is baptizing,
050870	
050871	and everyone
050872	is flocking
050873	to him!”
050874	
050875	replied,
050876	John
050877	
050878	
050879	“No
050880	can
050881	one
050882	receive
050883	
050884	anything
050885	
050886	unless
050887	it has been
050888	given to him
050889	
050890	from
050891	
050892	heaven.
050893	
050894	
050895	
050896	You yourselves can testify
050897	
050898	that I said,
050899	
050900	not
050901	‘I am
050902	
050903	
050904	the Christ,’
050905	but rather,
050906	
050907	sent
050908	‘I have been
050909	before
050910	him.’
050911	
050912	The one who has
050913	
050914	the bride
050915	the bridegroom.
050916	is
050917

050919	The friend
050920	
050921	of the bridegroom,
050922	
050923	who stands by
050924	
050925	and listens for him,
050926	
050927	greatly
050928	rejoices
050929	
050930	
050931	voice.
050932	
050933	when he hears the bridegroom’s
050934	
050935	This then
050936	
050937	joy,
050938	
050939	is my
050940	and it is complete.
050941	He
050942	must
050943	become more important
050944	
050945	while
050946	I become less important.”
050947	
050948	from above
050949	The one who comes
050950	superior
050951	to all.
050952	is
050953	
050954	The one who is
050955	from

050968	from
050969	
050970	heaven
050971	The one who comes
050972	superior

050974	
050975	about what
050976	he has seen

050980	He testifies
050981	
050982	
050983	his testimony.

050985	but no one

050988	The one who has accepted
050989	
050990	
050991	his testimony
050992	has confirmed clearly
050993	
050994	
050995	that God
050996	truthful.
050997	is
050998	the one whom

051421	what
051422	you do not

051424	
051425	We worship
051426	what
051427	we know,

051429	
051430	because salvation

051485	“whenever
051486	he comes,
051487	
051488	he will tell us
051489	
051490	everything.”
051491	said to her,
051492	
051493	
051494	Jesus
051495	
051496	am he.”
051497	
051498	“I, the one speaking to you,
051499	
051500	
051501	Now at
051502	
051503	came back.
051504	
051505	that very moment his disciples
051506	
051507	
051508	They were shocked
051509	
051510	with
051511	a woman.
051512	because he was speaking
051513	no one
051514	However,
051515	said,
051516	“What
051517	do you want?”
051518	or
051519	“Why
051520	are you speaking
051521	with her?”
051522	
051523	left
051524	Then
051525	
051526	her water jar,
051527	
051528	
051529	the woman
051530	
051531	went off
051532	into
051533	
051534	the town
051535	
051536	and said
051537	
051538	to the people,
051539	“Come,
051540	see
051541	a man
051542	who
051543	told me
051544	
051545	everything
051546	I ever
051547	did.
051548	Surely he can’t
051549	
051550	be
051551	
051552	the Messiah, can he?”
051553	So they left
051554	
051555	
051556	the town
051557	
051558	and began coming
051559	to him.
051560	
051561	
051562	
051563	Meanwhile
051564	were urging him,
051565	
051566	
051567	the disciples
051568	
051569	“Rabbi,
051570	eat something.”
051571	
051572	But
051573	he said to them,
051574	
051575	
051576	food
051577	“I have
051578	to eat
051579	that
051580	
051581	nothing about.”
051582	you know
051583	began to say
051584	So
051585	
051586	the disciples
051587	to
051588	one another,
051589	“No
051590	one
051591	brought him
051592	
051593	anything to eat, did they?”
051594	said to them,
051595	
051596	
051597	Jesus
051598	“My
051599	food
051600	is
051601	to
051602	do
051603	
051604	the will
051605	
051606	of the one who sent me
051607	
051608	
051609	and to complete
051610	
051611	
051612	his work.
051613	Don’t
051614	
051615	you say,
051616	
051617	more months
051618	four
051619	‘There are
051620	
051621	
051622	the harvest?’
051623	and then comes
051624	
051625	I tell you,
051626	
051627	
051628	
051629	look up
051630	
051631	
051632	and see
051633	
051634	that the fields
051635	
051636	white
051637	are
051638	for
051639	harvest!
051640	already
051641	
051642	The one who reaps
051643	pay
051644	receives
051645	
051646	and gathers
051647	fruit
051648	for
051649	life,
051650	eternal
051651	so that
051652	
051653	the one who sows
051654	together.
051655	can rejoice
051656	
051657	
051658	and the one who reaps
051659	in
051660	For
051661	
051662	
051663	this instance the saying
051664	is
051665	true,
051666	
051667	and another
051668	
051669	
051670	‘One sows
051671	
051672	
051673	
051674	reaps.’
051675	
051676	I sent
051677	
051678	you to reap
051679	what you
051680	did not
051681	
051682	work for;
051683	others
051684	have labored
051685	
051686	
051687	into
051688	
051689	their labor.”
051690	
051691	and you have entered
051692	from
051693	Now
051694	
051695	town
051696	that
051697	many
051698	believed
051699	in him
051700	
051701	
051702	Samaritans
051703	because of
051704	
051705	the report
051706	
051707	of the woman
051708	who testified,
051709	
051710	“He told me
051711	
051712	everything
051713	
051714	I ever did.”
051715	when
051716	So
051717	came
051718	to him,
051719	
051720	
051721	the Samaritans
051722	they began asking him
051723	
051724	to stay
051725	with them.
051726	
051727	
051728	He stayed
051729	there
051730	two
051731	days,
051732	
051733	many
051734	more
051735	believed.
051736	and because of
051737	
051738	his word
051739	
051740	
051741	
051742	to the woman,
051743	They said
051744	
051745	“No longer
051746	because of
051747	
051748	your
051749	words,
051750	do we believe
051751	
051752	for
051753	we have heard
051754	
051755	for ourselves, and we know
051756	
051757	
051758	is
051759	that this one really
051760	
051761	the Savior
051762	
051763	of the world.”
051764	After
051765	
051766	
051767	the two
051768	days
051769	he departed
051770	from there
051771	to
051772	
051773	Galilee.
051774	
051775	(For
051776	Jesus himself
051777	had testified
051778	
051779	that a prophet
051780	in
051781	
051782	his own
051783	country.)
051784	honor
051785	no
051786	has
051787	when
051788	So
051789	he came
051790	to
051791	
051792	Galilee,
051793	welcomed him
051794	
051795	
051796	the Galileans
051797	all the things
051798	because they had seen
051799	
051800	he had done
051801	in
051802	Jerusalem
051803	at
051804	
051805	the feast
051806	
051807	
051808	(for they themselves
051809	had gone
051810	to
051811	
051812	the feast).
051813	he came
051814	Now
051815	again
051816	to
051817	
051818	Cana
051819	
051820	in Galilee
051821	where
051822	he had made
051823	
051824	the water
051825	wine.
051826	
051827	there was
051828	a certain
051829	royal official
051830	whose
051831	
051832	son
051833	was sick.
051834	In
051835	Capernaum
051836	
051837	When he heard
051838	
051839	that Jesus
051840	had come back
051841	from
051842	
051843	Judea
051844	to
051845	
051846	Galilee,
051847	he went
051848	to
051849	him
051850	
051851	and begged
051852	
051853	him to come down
051854	
051855	and heal
051856	
051857	
051858	his son,
051859	who was about
051860	
051861	to die.
051862	said
051863	So
051864	
051865	Jesus
051866	to him,
051867	
051868	
051869	“Unless
051870	signs
051871	
051872	and wonders
051873	you people see
051874	
051875	you will never
051876	believe!”
051877	said
051878	to him,
051879	
051880	
051881	the official
051882	“Sir,”
051883	“come down
051884	before
051885	dies.”
051886	
051887	my child
051888	
051889	told him,
051890	
051891	
051892	Jesus
051893	“Go
051894	
051895	home; your son
051896	
051897	will live.”
051898	believed
051899	
051900	The man
051901	
051902	the word
051903	that
051904	spoke to him,
051905	
051906	
051907	Jesus
051908	
051909	and set off for home.
051910	While
051911	
051912	he was on his
051913	way down,
051914	
051915	his slaves
051916	
051917	met him
051918	
051919	and told him
051920	
051921	
051922	that his son
051923	
051924	was going to live.
051925	he asked them
051926	So
051927	
051928	the time
051929	
051930	
051931	when
051932	
051933	to improve,
051934	his condition began
051935	and they told him,
051936	
051937	
051938	
051939	“Yesterday
051940	
051941	at one o’clock in the afternoon
051942	left him.”
051943	
051944	
051945	the fever
051946	realized
051947	Then
051948	
051949	the father
051950	
051951	
051952	that it was the very
051953	
051954	time
051955	
051956	
051957	had said to him,
051958	
051959	
051960	Jesus
051961	
051962	“Your son
051963	
051964	will live,”
051965	
051966	and he himself believed
051967	
051968	
051969	
051970	household.
051971	
051972	along with his entire
051973	
051974	
051975	
051976	this as his second
051977	miraculous sign
051978	did
051979	
051980	Jesus
051981	when he returned
051982	from
051983	
051984	Judea
051985	to
051986	
051987	Galilee.
051988	After
051989	
051990	this there was
051991	feast,
051992	
051993	a Jewish
051994	
051995	went up
051996	and Jesus
051997	to
051998	Jerusalem.
051999	there is
052000	Now
052001	in
052002	
052003	Jerusalem
052004	by
052005

052013	covered walkways.
052014	which has
052015	in these walkways.
052016	
052017	people were lying
052018	A great number
052019	
052020	of sick,
052021	blind,
052022	lame,
052023	and paralyzed
052024	was
052025	Now
052026	
052027	a man
052028	there
052029	for thirty-
052030	
052031	eight
052032	years.
052033	
052034	
052035	
052036	who had been disabled
052037	
052038	
052039	saw
052040	
052041	When Jesus
052042	him lying
052043	
052044	there and when he realized
052045	
052046	been disabled a long
052047	already,
052048	time
052049	that the man had
052050	he said to him,
052051	
052052	“Do you want
052053	well?”
052054	to become
052055	answered him,
052056	
052057	
052058	The sick man
052059	“Sir,
052060	one
052061	no
052062	I have
052063	to
052064	when
052065	is stirred up.
052066	
052067	the water
052068	put me
052069	
052070	
052071	
052072	into the pool
052073	into
052074	
052075	While
052076	I am trying to get
052077	
052078	the water, someone else
052079	there before me.”
052080	
052081	goes down
052082	said to him,
052083	
052084	
052085	Jesus
052086	“Stand up!
052087	Pick up
052088	
052089	your mat
052090	
052091	
052092	and walk.”
052093	
052094	Immediately
052095	was
052096	healed,
052097	
052098	the man
052099	
052100	and he picked up
052101	
052102	his mat
052103	
052104	
052105	and started walking.
052106	was
052107	(Now
052108	a Sabbath.)
052109	
052110	that
052111	
052112	day
052113	said
052114	So
052115	
052116	the Jewish leaders
052117	
052118	to the man who had been healed,
052119	the Sabbath,
052120	“It is
052121	and
052122	are not
052123	permitted
052124	you
052125	to carry
052126	
052127	your mat.”
052128	
052129	
052130	But
052131	he answered them,
052132	
052133	
052134	“The man who made me
052135	
052136	well
052137	
052138	
052139	said to me,
052140	‘Pick up
052141	
052142	your mat
052143	
052144	
052145	and walk.’”
052146	They asked him,
052147	
052148	
052149	“Who is
052150	
052151	the man
052152	
052153	who said to you,
052154	
052155	‘Pick up
052156	
052157	your mat and walk’?”
052158	
052159	But
052160	the man who had been healed
052161	did not
052162	know
052163	who
052164	it was,
052165	
052166	for
052167	Jesus
052168	had slipped out,
052169	a crowd
052170	since there was
052171	in
052172	
052173	that place.
052174	After
052175	
052176	found him
052177	
052178	
052179	this Jesus
052180	at
052181	
052182	the temple
052183	
052184	and said to him,
052185	
052186	“Look,
052187	well.
052188	you have become
052189	Don’t
052190	sin any more,
052191	
052192	lest
052193	worse
052194	
052195	anything
052196	happen to you.”
052197	went away
052198	
052199	The man
052200	
052201	and informed
052202	
052203	the Jewish leaders
052204	
052205	that Jesus
052206	was
052207	
052208	the one who had made him
052209	
052210	well.
052211	
052212	
052213	
052214	began persecuting
052215	
052216	the Jewish leaders
052217	
052218	him.
052219	
052220	
052221	Now because Jesus was doing
052222	these things on
052223	the Sabbath,
052224	
052225	So
052226	
052227	he told them,
052228	
052229	
052230	“My Father
052231	
052232	until
052233	now,
052234	is working
052235	and I
052236	too am working.”
052237	For
052238	this reason
052239	
052240	even harder
052241	were trying
052242	
052243	
052244	the Jewish leaders
052245	to kill
052246	
052247	him, because not
052248	only
052249	was he breaking
052250	
052251	the Sabbath,
052252	but
052253	
052254	Father,
052255	his own
052256	he was also calling
052257	
052258	God
052259	equal
052260	himself
052261	thus making
052262	
052263	with God.
052264	answered them,
052265	So
052266	
052267	Jesus
052268	
052269	“I tell you
052270	
052271	the solemn
052272	truth,
052273	
052274	
052275	
052276	can
052277	
052278	the Son
052279	do
052280	on
052281	his own initiative,
052282	nothing
052283	
052284	but only
052285	what
052286	he sees
052287	
052288	the Father
052289	doing.
052290	whatever
052291	For
052292	
052293	the Father
052294	does,
052295	
052296	
052297	
052298	the Son
052299	likewise.
052300	does
052301	
052302	For
052303	the Father
052304	loves
052305	
052306	the Son
052307	
052308	everything
052309	and shows him
052310	
052311	
052312	
052313	he does,
052314	
052315	greater
052316	
052317	and will show him
052318	
052319	deeds than these,
052320	so that
052321	
052322	you will be amazed.
052323	just as
052324	For
052325	
052326	the Father
052327	raises
052328	
052329	the dead
052330	
052331	and gives them life,
052332	so
052333	
052334	
052335	also the Son
052336	to whomever
052337	he wishes.
052338	gives life
052339	does not
052340	Furthermore,
052341	
052342	the Father
052343	judge
052344	anyone,
052345	but
052346	
052347	judgment
052348	all
052349	has assigned
052350	
052351	to the Son,
052352	so that
052353	all people
052354	will honor
052355	
052356	the Son
052357	just as
052358	they honor
052359	
052360	the Father.
052361	
052362	The one who does not
052363	honor
052364	
052365	the Son
052366	does not
052367	honor
052368	
052369	the Father
052370	
052371	who sent him.
052372	
052373	the solemn
052374	truth,
052375	“I tell you
052376	
052377	
052378	
052379	
052380	my message
052381	
052382	the one who hears
052383	
052384	and believes
052385	
052386	the one who sent me
052387	
052388	has
052389	life
052390	eternal
052391	
052392	to
052393	
052394	and will not

052400	death
052401	
052402	
052403	life.
052404	the solemn
052405	truth,
052406	I tell you
052407	
052408	
052409	is coming –
052410	a time
052411	
052412	now
052413	and is
052414	here – when
052415	
052416	the dead
052417	will hear
052418	
052419	the voice
052420	
052421	of the Son
052422	
052423	of God,
052424	
052425	
052426	and those who hear
052427	will live.
052428	just as
052429	For
052430	
052431	the Father
052432	has
052433	life
052434	in

052568	you may be saved.)
052569	He
052570	was
052571	
052572	a lamp

052787	of the Sea
052788	
052789	of Galilee
052790	
052791	(also called the Sea of Tiberias).
052792	was following him
052793	
052794	
052795	crowd
052796	A large
052797	
052798	because they were observing

052800	the miraculous signs
052801	
052802	he was performing
052803	on
052804	
052805	the sick.
052806	went on up
052807	So
052808	
052809	
052810	the mountainside
052811	Jesus
052812	
052813	there
052814	and sat down

052817	his disciples.

052825	Feast
052826	
052827	the Jewish
052828	when he looked up
052829	Then
052830	
052831	
052832	
052833	Jesus,
052834	
052835	and saw
052836	
052837	that a large
052838	crowd
052839	was coming
052840	to him,
052841	
052842	said
052843	to
052844	Philip,
052845	“Where
052846	can we buy
052847	bread
052848	so that
052849	these people may eat?”
052850	
052851	
052852	(Now
052853	Jesus said
052854	this to test him,
052855	
052856	
052857	for
052858	he knew
052859	what
052860	he was going
052861	to do.)
052862	replied,
052863	
052864	
052865	Philip
052866	“Two hundred
052867	silver coins
052868	worth of bread
052869	would not
052870	be enough for them,
052871	
052872	for
052873	each one
052874	a little.”
052875	
052876	to get
052877	said to him,
052878	
052879	One
052880	of
052881	
052882	Jesus’ disciples,
052883	
052884	Andrew,
052885	
052886	brother,
052887	Simon
052888	Peter’s
052889	is
052890	a boy
052891	“Here
052892	who
052893	has
052894	five
052895	loaves
052896	barley
052897	
052898	and two
052899	fish,
052900	but
052901	
052902	what
052903	good are
052904	these for
052905	so many people?”
052906	said,
052907	
052908	Jesus
052909	“Have
052910	
052911	the people
052912	sit down.”
052913	there was
052914	(Now
052915	of grass
052916	a lot
052917	in
052918	that
052919	place.)
052920	sat down,
052921	So
052922	the
052923	men
052924	in
052925	number.
052926	about
052927	five thousand
052928	took
052929	Then
052930	
052931	the loaves,
052932	
052933	Jesus
052934	
052935	and when he had given thanks,
052936	he distributed
052937	
052938	the bread to those who were seated.
052939	He then did the same
052940	
052941	with
052942	
052943	the fish,
052944	as much as
052945	they wanted.
052946	When
052947	
052948	they were all satisfied,
052949	Jesus said
052950	
052951	to his disciples,
052952	
052953	“Gather up
052954	
052955	that are left over,
052956	the broken pieces
052957	
052958	so that
052959	nothing
052960	is wasted.”
052961	they gathered them up
052962	So
052963	
052964	and filled
052965	twelve
052966	baskets
052967	with broken pieces
052968	from
052969	
052970	the five
052971	loaves
052972	
052973	barley
052974	
052975	left over
052976	
052977	by the people who had eaten.
052978	
052979	Now
052980	when the people
052981	saw
052982	that
052983	Jesus performed,
052984	the miraculous sign
052985	they began to say
052986	
052987	
052988	to one another, “This is
052989	certainly
052990	
052991	the Prophet
052992	
052993	who is to come
052994	into
052995	
052996	the world.”
052997	Jesus,
052998	Then
052999	because he knew
053000	
053001	they were going to
053002	come
053003	
053004	and seize him
053005	
053006	by force
053007	to make
053008	him king,
053009	withdrew
053010	again
053011	up
053012	
053013	the mountainside
053014	
053015	alone.
053016	when
053017	Now
053018	evening
053019	came,
053020	went down
053021	
053022	his disciples
053023	
053024	to
053025	
053026	the lake,
053027	
053028	got into
053029	
053030	a boat,
053031	and started
053032	to cross
053033	
053034	the lake
053035	to
053036	Capernaum.
053037	
053038	dark,
053039	(It had already
053040	become
053041	
053042	had not yet
053043	come
053044	to
053045	them.)
053046	
053047	and Jesus
053048	
053049	By now
053050	and the sea
053051	wind
053052	a strong
053053	was blowing
053054	was getting rough.
053055	when they had rowed
053056	Then,
053057	about
053058	miles,
053059	
053060	three
053061	or
053062	four
053063	they caught sight
053064	
053065	of Jesus
053066	walking
053067	on
053068	
053069	the lake,
053070	
053071	
053072	
053073	the boat,
053074	approaching
053075	
053076	and they were frightened.
053077	
053078	But
053079	he said to them,
053080	
053081	
053082	“It is
053083	I. Do not
053084	be afraid.”
053085	they wanted
053086	Then
053087	to take him
053088	
053089	into
053090	
053091	the boat,
053092	
053093	and immediately
053094	came
053095	
053096	the boat
053097	to
053098	
053099	the land
053100	where
053101	
053102	they had been heading.
053103	
053104	The next day
053105	
053106	the crowd
053107	
053108	that remained
053109	on the other side
053110	
053111	of the lake
053112	realized that

053115	
053116	had not
053117	had been
053118	there,

053126	
053127	with his disciples,

053129	
053130	and that Jesus

053133	it
053134	but
053135	alone.

053147	the place
053148	where
053149	they had eaten
053150	
053151	the bread
053152	had given thanks.
053153	
053154	after the Lord
053155	when
053156	So
053157	realized
053158	
053159	the crowd

053161	that neither Jesus
053162	
053163	were
053164	there,
053165	nor
053166	
053167	his disciples
053168	
053169	they got into
053170	
053171	to
053172	
053173	the boats
053174	
053175	and came
053176	
053177	Capernaum
053178	looking for
053179	
053180	Jesus.
053181	
053182	When they found him
053183	
053184	on the other side
053185	
053186	of the lake,
053187	they said to him,
053188	
053189	“Rabbi,
053190	when
053191	here?”
053192	did you get
053193	replied,
053194	
053195	
053196	Jesus
053197	
053198	“I tell you
053199	the solemn
053200	truth,
053201	
053202	
053203	you are looking for me
053204	
053205	not
053206	
053207	because you saw
053208	miraculous signs,
053209	but
053210	
053211	because you ate
053212	
053213	
053214	all the loaves of bread
053215	
053216	you wanted.
053217	work
053218	Do not
053219	
053220	for the food
053221	
053222	that disappears,
053223	but
053224	
053225	for the food
053226	
053227	that remains
053228	to
053229	life –
053230	eternal
053231	the food which
053232	
053233	the Son
053234	
053235	of Man
053236	
053237	will give to you.
053238	on him.”
053239	For
053240	
053241	the Father
053242	has put his seal of approval
053243	
053244	God
053245	they said
053246	So then
053247	to him,
053248	
053249	“What
053250	must we do
053251	to
053252	accomplish
053253	
053254	the deeds
053255	
053256	God requires?”
053257	replied,
053258	
053259	Jesus
053260	
053261	
053262	
053263	
053264	“This is
053265	
053266	the deed

053272	whom
053273	he sent.”
053274	the one

053276	So
053277	
053278	what
053279	“Then

053284	we may see
053285	
053286	it and believe you?
053287	
053288	What
053289	will you do?

053294	the manna
053295	to eat
053296	in
053297	
053298	the wilderness,
053299	just as
053300	it is
053301	written,

053306	‘He gave them

053313	Jesus
053314	the solemn

053316	told them,
053317	
053318	it is not
053319	Moses

053322	
053323	the bread
053324	from

053326	heaven,
053327	but
053328	
053329	my Father
053330	
053331	is giving you
053332	
053333	
053334	bread
053335	from
053336	
053337	heaven.
053338	
053339	the true
053340	
053341	For
053342	the bread
053343	
053344	of God

053351	
053352	life
053353	and gives
053354	
053355	to the world.”
053356	they said
053357	So
053358	to him,
053359	
053360	“Sir,
053361	all the time!”
053362	give us
053363	
053364	
053365	this bread
053366	
053367	said to them,
053368	
053369	
053370	Jesus
053371	
053372	“I am
053373	
053374	the bread
053375	
053376	of life.
053377	
053378	The one who comes
053379	to me
053380	
053381	
053382	will never
053383	go hungry,
053384	and
053385	the one who
053386	believes
053387	in me
053388	
053389	
053390	will never
053391	be thirsty.
053392	
053393	But
053394	I told you
053395	
053396	
053397	
053398	that you have seen me
053399	
053400	
053401	and still do not
053402	believe.
053403	Everyone
053404	whom
053405	gives me
053406	
053407	
053408	the Father
053409	to me,
053410	
053411	will come
053412	
053413	
053414	and the one who comes
053415	to me
053416	
053417	
053418	I will never
053419	send
053420	away.
053421	
053422	For I have come down
053423	from
053424	
053425	heaven
053426	not
053427	to

053437	of the one who sent me.
053438	
053439	
053440	Now
053441	this is
053442	
053443	the will
053444	
053445	of the one who sent me –
053446	
053447	that
053448	every
053449	one
053450	he has given me,

053478	and believes
053479	in him
053480	
053481	to have
053482	life,

053492	who were hostile to Jesus began complaining
053493	Then
053494	
053495	the Jews
053496	about him
053497	
053498	
053499	because he said,

053878	
053879	human nature
053880	is of no
053881	help!
053882	
053883	
053884	The words
053885	that
053886	
053887	I have spoken
053888	to you are
053889	spirit
053890	and are
053891	
053892	life.
053893	
053894	But
053895	there are
053896	of you
053897	
053898	some
053899	who
053900	do not
053901	believe.”
053902	had already known
053903	(For
053904	from
053905	the beginning
053906	
053907	Jesus
053908	who
053909	those were
053910	
053911	who did not
053912	believe,
053913	
053914	and who
053915	it was
053916	
053917	who would betray him.)
053918	
053919	
053920	So Jesus added,
053921	“Because of
053922	
053923	this I told you
053924	
053925	
053926	that no one
053927	can
053928	come
053929	to me
053930	
053931	
053932	unless
053933	
053934	has allowed him to come.”
053935	
053936	
053937	
053938	the Father
053939	After
053940	
053941	this many
053942	of
053943	
053944	his disciples
053945	
053946	quit
053947	
053948	
053949	following
053950	
053951	him and did not
053952	
053953	him any longer.
053954	accompany
053955	said
053956	So
053957	
053958	Jesus
053959	
053960	to the twelve,
053961	“You don’t
053962	
053963	
053964	want
053965	to go away too, do you?”
053966	answered him,
053967	
053968	Simon
053969	Peter
053970	“Lord,
053971	to
053972	whom
053973	would we go?
053974	the words
053975	life.
053976	of eternal
053977	You have
053978	
053979	
053980	We have come to believe
053981	
053982	and to know
053983	
053984	
053985	that you are
053986	
053987	the Holy One
053988	
053989	of God!”
053990	replied,
053991	
053992	
053993	Jesus
053994	“Didn’t
053995	
053996	
053997	
053998	the twelve,
053999	I choose you,
054000	
054001	of
054002	
054003	and yet one
054004	the devil?”
054005	you is
054006	he said
054007	(Now
054008	
054009	this about Judas
054010	son of Simon
054011	Iscariot,
054012	
054013	for
054014	was going to
054015	betray him.)
054016	
054017	Judas, one
054018	of
054019	
054020	the twelve,
054021	
054022	After
054023	
054024	traveled
054025	
054026	this Jesus
054027	throughout
054028	
054029	Galilee.
054030	
054031	
054032	
054033	of
054034	
054035	Judea
054036	He stayed out
054037	
054038	wanted
054039	
054040	
054041	because the Jewish leaders
054042	to kill him.
054043	was
054044	Now
054045	near.
054046	
054047	Feast
054048	
054049	the Jewish
054050	
054051	of Shelters
054052	advised him,
054053	So
054054	
054055	
054056	
054057	Jesus’ brothers
054058	
054059	“Leave
054060	here
054061	
054062	and go
054063	to
054064	
054065	Judea
054066	so
054067	
054068	
054069	your disciples
054070	
054071	may see
054072	
054073	
054074	your miracles
054075	that
054076	you are performing.
054077	no one
054078	For
054079	anything
054080	in
054081	secret.
054082	does
054083	
054084	who seeks
054085	
054086	
054087	a reputation for himself
054088	to make
054089	If
054090	
054091	you are doing
054092	these things, show
054093	yourself
054094	
054095	to the world.”
054096	not even
054097	(For
054098	
054099	his own brothers
054100	
054101	believed
054102	in him.)
054103	
054104	replied,
054105	So
054106	
054107	
054108	Jesus
054109	
054110	time
054111	
054112	“My
054113	has not yet
054114	arrived,
054115	
054116	but
054117	
054118	
054119	you
054120	at any opportunity!
054121	are
054122	ready
054123	
054124	cannot
054125	
054126	The world
054127	hate you,
054128	
054129	
054130	but
054131	it hates me,
054132	
054133	
054134	because I am testifying
054135	about it
054136	
054137	
054138	
054139	that its deeds
054140	
054141	evil.
054142	are
054143	
054144	You go up
054145	to
054146	
054147	the feast yourselves.
054148	
054149	I am not
054150	going up
054151	to
054152	
054153	this feast
054154	
054155	
054156	
054157	because my
054158	time
054159	has not yet
054160	fully arrived.”
054161	
054162	
054163	When he had said
054164	
054165	this, he remained
054166	in
054167	
054168	Galilee.
054169	when
054170	But
054171	had gone up
054172	
054173	his brothers
054174	
054175	to
054176	
054177	the feast,
054178	then Jesus himself
054179	
054180	
054181	also went up,
054182	not
054183	openly
054184	but
054185	
054186	in
054187	secret.
054188	
054189	So
054190	the Jewish leaders
054191	were looking for him
054192	
054193	at
054194	
054195	the feast,
054196	
054197	asking,
054198	“Where
054199	is
054200	he?”
054201	
054202	of grumbling
054203	about him
054204	
054205	There was
054206	a lot
054207	among
054208	
054209	the crowds.
054210	
054211	Some
054212	were saying,
054213	
054214	a good man,”
054215	“He is
054216	others,
054217	but
054218	
054219	
054220	
054221	“He deceives
054222	
054223	the common people.”
054224	no one
054225	However,
054226	openly
054227	spoke
054228	about him
054229	
054230	for
054231	
054232	fear
054233	
054234	of the Jewish leaders.
054235	
054236	
054237	
054238	When the feast
054239	was half over,
054240	went up
054241	Jesus
054242	to
054243	
054244	the temple courts
054245	
054246	and began to teach.
054247	were astonished
054248	Then
054249	
054250	the Jewish leaders
054251	and said,
054252	“How
054253	
054254	formal instruction?”
054255	does this man know
054256	so much when he has never
054257	had
054258	replied,
054259	So
054260	
054261	
054262	Jesus
054263	
054264	
054265	
054266	“My
054267	teaching
054268	not
054269	is
054270	from me,
054271	but
054272	
054273	from the one who sent me.
054274	
054275	If
054276	anyone
054277	wants
054278	
054279	God’s will,
054280	
054281	to do
054282	he will know
054283	about
054284	
054285	my teaching,
054286	whether
054287	from
054288	
054289	God
054290	it is
054291	or
054292	
054293	from
054294	my own authority.
054295	whether I speak
054296	
054297	on
054298	his own
054299	The person who speaks
054300	
054301	to receive honor
054302	
054303	for himself;
054304	authority desires
054305	
054306	
054307	the one who desires
054308	
054309	the honor
054310	
054311	of the one who sent him
054312	
054313	
054314	a man of integrity,
054315	is
054316	
054317	unrighteousness
054318	in him.
054319	
054320	no
054321	and there is
054322	Hasn’t
054323	Moses
054324	given you
054325	
054326	
054327	the law?
054328	
054329	Yet not one
054330	of
054331	
054332	you keeps
054333	
054334	the law!
054335	Why
054336	
054337	do you want
054338	to kill me?”
054339	answered,
054340	
054341	The crowd
054342	by a demon!
054343	“You’re possessed
054344	Who
054345	
054346	is trying
054347	to kill you?”
054348	replied,
054349	Jesus
054350	
054351	
054352	
054353	one
054354	miracle
054355	“I performed
054356	
054357	and you are all
054358	amazed.
054359	
054360	However, because
054361	Moses
054362	gave you
054363	
054364	
054365	the practice of circumcision
054366	(not
054367	
054368	from
054369	
054370	Moses,
054371	that it came
054372	but
054373	from
054374	
054375	the forefathers),
054376	
054377	on
054378	the Sabbath.
054379	you circumcise
054380	a male child
054381	But if
054382	is circumcised
054383	
054384	a male child
054385	on
054386	the Sabbath
054387	so that
054388	is not
054389	broken,
054390	
054391	the law
054392	of Moses
054393	
054394	why are you angry with me
054395	
054396	completely
054397	a man
054398	well
054399	because I made
054400	on
054401	the Sabbath?
054402	Do not
054403	judge
054404	according
054405	to external appearance,
054406	but
054407	
054408	with proper
054409	judgment.”
054410	judge
054411	began to say,
054412	Then
054413	some
054414	of
054415	
054416	the residents of Jerusalem
054417	“Isn’t
054418	
054419	
054420	this the man
054421	they are trying
054422	to kill?
054423	
054424	Yet here
054425	publicly,
054426	he is, speaking
054427	
054428	nothing to him.
054429	
054430	and they are saying
054431	
054432	really
054433	know
054434	
054435	Do the ruling authorities
054436	
054437	
054438	that this man is
054439	
054440	the Christ?
054441	But
054442	this man
054443	we know
054444	where
054445	comes from.
054446	
054447	
054448	the Christ
054449	Whenever
054450	comes,
054451	no one
054452	will know
054453	where
054454	he comes from.”
054455	cried out,
054456	Then
054457	in
054458	the
054459	temple courts,
054460	while teaching
054461	
054462	Jesus,
054463	
054464	
054465	me
054466	“You both know
054467	
054468	and know
054469	where
054470	I come from!
054471	
054472	on
054473	my own initiative,
054474	And I have not
054475	come
054476	but
054477	is
054478	true.
054479	the one who
054480	sent me
054481	
054482	him,
054483	
054484	You do not
054485	know
054486	
054487	but I know him,
054488	
054489	
054490	from him
054491	
054492	because I have come
054493	and he
054494	
054495	sent me.”
054496	they tried
054497	So then
054498	
054499	to seize
054500	
054501	Jesus, but no one
054502	laid
054503	on him,
054504	
054505	
054506	a hand
054507	
054508	had not yet
054509	come.
054510	
054511	because his time
054512	
054513	of
054514	
054515	the crowd
054516	Yet
054517	many
054518	believed
054519	in him
054520	
054521	
054522	and said,
054523	
054524	the Christ
054525	“Whenever
054526	comes,
054527	he won’t
054528	more
054529	miraculous signs than this man did, will he?”
054530	perform
054531	
054532	
054533	
054534	heard
054535	
054536	The Pharisees
054537	
054538	the crowd
054539	murmuring
054540	these things about
054541	
054542	
054543	
054544	sent
054545	
054546	Jesus, so the chief priests
054547	
054548	
054549	and the Pharisees
054550	officers
054551	to
054552	arrest him.
054553	
054554	said,
054555	Then
054556	
054557	Jesus
054558	longer,
054559	while
054560	for only a little
054561	with you
054562	
054563	“I will be
054564	
054565	and then I am going
054566	to
054567	
054568	the one who sent me.
054569	
054570	You will look for me
054571	
054572	
054573	but will not
054574	find me,
054575	
054576	
054577	and where
054578	I am
054579	
054580	
054581	
054582	you cannot
054583	come.”
054584	said
054585	Then
054586	
054587	the Jewish leaders
054588	to
054589	one another,
054590	“Where
054591	
054592	is he going to
054593	go
054594	
054595	
054596	that we cannot

054598	
054599	He is not

054643	Jesus
054644	
054645	and shouted out,
054646	
054647	“If

054671	
054672	(Now
054673	he said
054674	this about

054678	were going
054679	to receive,

054692	some
054693	
054694	of the crowd
054695	
054696	When they heard
054697	
054698	these words,
054699	
054700	began to say,

054702	is
054703	“This really

054706	Others
054707	said,

054709	“This is
054710	
054711	the Christ!”
054712	
054713	But
054714	still others said,
054715	“No,

054745	there was
054746	in
054747	
054748	the crowd
054749	because of Jesus.
054750	
054751	Some
054752	
054753	were wanting
054754	of them
054755	
054756	to seize him,

054758	but
054759	no one

054761	on him.
054762	
054763	
054764	a hand

054766	Then
054767	
054768	the officers
054769	to
054770	
054771	the chief priests
054772	
054773	and Pharisees,
054774	
054775	said to them,

054777	who
054778	
054779	“Why
054780	didn’t
054781	you bring him back with you?”
054782	
054783	replied,
054784	
054785	The officers
054786	“No one ever
054787	spoke
054788	like
054789	this man!”
054790	answered,
054791	Then

054853	
054854	
054855	They replied,

054883	went
054884	to
054885	
054886	the Mount
054887	
054888	of Olives.
054889	Early in the morning
054890	
054891	again.
054892	he came
054893	to
054894	
054895	the temple courts

054897	All
054898	
054899	the people

054901	to

054903	
054904	and he sat down
054905	and began to teach them.
054906	
054907	brought
054908	
054909	
054910	The experts in the law
054911	
054912	
054913	and the Pharisees
054914	a woman
054915	committing
054916	adultery.
054917	who had been caught
054918	
054919	They made her stand
054920	
054921	
054922	in front of them
054923	and said
054924	
054925	to Jesus, “Teacher,
054926	
054927	
054928	this woman
054929	was caught
054930	
054931	in the very act

054934	
054935	
054936	the law
054937	
054938	Moses
054939	commanded us
054940	
054941	to death such women.
054942	to stone
054943	
054944	then
054945	What
054946	do you say?”
054947	
054948	(Now
054949	they were asking
054950	this in an attempt to trap him,
054951	
054952	so that
054953	they could bring
054954	charges against him.)
054955	
054956	
054957	
054958	Jesus
054959	
054960	bent down
054961	
054962	with his finger.
054963	and wrote
054964	on

054966	the ground

054968	
054969	they persisted
054970	in asking him,
054971	
054972	he stood up straight
054973	
054974	and replied,
054975	
054976	
054977	“Whoever among you is guiltless
054978	
054979	may be the first
054980	at her.”

054982	to throw
054983	a stone

054985	again
054986	Then he bent over
054987	and wrote
054988	on
054989	
054990	the ground.
054991	
054992	Now
054993	when they heard
054994	this, they began to drift away
054995	one
054996	
054997	at a time,
054998	starting
054999	with
055000	
055001	the older
055002	
055003	ones, until Jesus was left
055004	alone
055005	
055006	
055007	with the woman
055008	
055009	before him.
055010	standing
055011	stood up straight
055012	and
055013	
055014	Jesus
055015	said to her,
055016	
055017	“Woman,
055018	where
055019	are
055020	they? Did no one
055021	
055022	condemn you?”
055023	
055024	
055025	She replied,
055026	“No one,
055027	Lord.”
055028	said,
055029	And
055030	
055031	Jesus
055032	“I do not

055034	you either.
055035	condemn
055036	Go,
055037	
055038	and from
055039	
055040	now on

055043	again,
055044	Then
055045	
055046	spoke out
055047	
055048	Jesus
055049	
055050	
055051	“I am

055068	the light

055070	of life.”
055071	objected,
055072	So
055073	
055074	
055075	the Pharisees
055076	
055077	about
055078	yourself;
055079	“You testify
055080	
055081	your testimony
055082	
055083	not
055084	is

055089	
055090	
055091	“Even if
055092

055105	
055106	and where
055107	I am going.
055108	
055109	But you
055110	people do not
055111	know
055112	where
055113	I came from
055114	or
055115	where
055116	I am going.
055117	
055118	by
055119	
055120	outward appearances;
055121	You people judge
055122	
055123	I do not
055124	judge
055125	anyone.
055126	
055127	But if
055128	I judge,

055138	alone
055139	not

055144	
055145	who sent me do so together.
055146	
055147	I and the Father

055172	
055173	
055174	who sent me
055175	
055176	and the Father

055178	Then
055179	
055180	“Who
055181	is
055182	
055183	your father?”
055184	
055185	answered,
055186	Jesus
055187	either
055188	me
055189	“You do not know
055190	or
055191	
055192	my Father.

055194	If
055195	
055196	you knew me
055197	
055198	
055199	my Father too.”
055200	
055201	
055202	you would know
055203	
055204	
055205	these words
055206	(Jesus spoke
055207	near
055208	
055209	the offering box
055210	while he was teaching
055211	in
055212	
055213	the temple courts.
055214	
055215	No one
055216	seized him
055217	
055218	
055219	had not yet

055221	
055222	because his time

055224	Jesus said to them

055233	
055234	in

055249	the Jewish leaders
055250	“Perhaps
055251	he is going to kill
055252	himself,

055265	
055266	from
055267	
055268	below;
055269	“You people are

055292	that you will die

055302	
055303	that I am

055307	your sins.”
055308	
055309	they said to him,
055310	So
055311	
055312	
055313	“Who
055314	are you?”
055315	replied,
055316	
055317	
055318	Jesus
055319	
055320	from the beginning.
055321	“What
055322	
055323	
055324	I have told you
055325	
055326	many things

055345	I speak

055349	(They did not
055350	understand
055351	
055352	
055353	about his Father.)
055354	
055355	that he was telling them
055356	said,

055402	because I always

055404	
055405	While he was saying
055406	these things, many people
055407	believed
055408	in him.
055409	
055410	said
055411	Then
055412	
055413	Jesus
055414	to
055415	
055416	who had believed him,

056011	As long as

056018	
056019	of the world.”
056020	
056021	Having said
056022	this, he spat
056023	on the ground
056024	
056025	and made
056026	some mud
056027	with
056028	
056029	the saliva.
056030	
056031	He smeared
056032	
056033	
056034	the mud
056035	on
056036	
056037	the blind man’s eyes

056039	and said to him,

056041	“Go

056047	of Siloam”
056048	(which
056049	is translated
056050	“sent”).
056051	the blind man went away
056052	So
056053	
056054	and washed,
056055	
056056	and came back

056058	
056059	Then
056060	the neighbors
056061	
056062	
056063	and the people who had seen him
056064	
056065	
056066	previously
056067	
056068	as a beggar
056069	“Is this

056073	
056074	
056075	the man who used to sit
056076	
056077	and beg?”
056078	Some people
056079	said,
056080	
056081	
056082	“This is
056083	the man!” while others
056084	said,
056085	“No,
056086	but
056087	like him.”
056088	
056089	he looks
056090	The man himself
056091	kept insisting,
056092	
056093	
056094	“I am the one!”
056095	they asked him,
056096	So
056097	
056098	“How
056099	then were you
056100	
056101	
056102	
056103	made to see?”
056104	He replied,
056105	
056106	
056107	“The man
056108	
056109	called
056110	Jesus

056114	smeared
056115	
056116	
056117	it on my eyes
056118	
056119	and told me,
056120	
056121	
056122	‘Go
056123	to
056124	
056125	Siloam
056126	
056127	and wash.’
056128	I went
056129	So
056130	
056131	and washed,
056132	and was able to see.”
056133	
056134	They said to him,
056135	
056136	“Where
056137	is
056138	that man?”
056139	“I don’t
056140	He replied,
056141	know.”
056142	They brought
056143	
056144	to
056145	
056146	the Pharisees.
056147	
056148	the man who used
056149	to be blind
056150	was
056151	(Now
056152	a Sabbath.)
056153	on
056154	which
056155	the day
056156	
056157	the mud
056158	made
056159	
056160	Jesus
056161	
056162	and caused him
056163	
056164	
056165	to see
056166	again
056167	So
056168	asked him
056169	
056170	
056171	
056172	the Pharisees
056173	how
056174	he had gained his sight.
056175	
056176	
056177	He replied,
056178	
056179	mud
056180	“He put
056181	
056182	on
056183	
056184	my eyes
056185	
056186	and I washed,
056187	
056188	and now I am able to see.”
056189	began to say,
056190	Then
056191	of
056192	
056193	the Pharisees
056194	some
056195	not

056201	“This man
056202	
056203	
056204	the Sabbath.”
056205	because he does not
056206	observe
056207	others
056208	But
056209	said,
056210	“How
056211	can
056212	a man
056213	who is a sinner
056214	such
056215	miraculous signs?”
056216	perform
056217	
056218	a division
056219	Thus there was
056220	among them.
056221	
056222	they asked
056223	So
056224	
056225	the man who used to be blind,
056226	again
056227	“What
056228	
056229	do you say
056230	about him,
056231	
056232	
056233	since he caused
056234	
056235	
056236	you to see?”
056237	
056238	
056239	the man replied.
056240	
056241	a prophet,”
056242	“He is
056243	refused
056244	to believe
056245	Now
056246	
056247	the Jewish religious leaders
056248	
056249	
056250	
056251	that he had really been
056252	blind
056253	
056254	and had gained his sight
056255	until
056256	at last
056257	they summoned
056258	the
056259	parents
056260	of the man
056261	who
056262	had become able to see.
056263	
056264	They asked
056265	
056266	you say
056267	
056268	the parents, “Is

056281	does he now
056282	replied,
056283	So
056284	
056285	his parents
056286	
056287	
056288	
056289	“We know

056296	
056297	
056298	blind.
056299	and that he was born
056300	how

056322	He will speak
056323

056352	a mature adult,
056353	“He is

056356	they summoned
056357	Then
056358	
056359	the man
056360	
056361	a second time
056362	who
056363	used to be
056364	blind
056365	
056366	and said to him,
056367	
056368	“Promise

056376	
056377	that this man

056397	
056398	“What
056399	did he do to you?
056400	
056401	How
056402	did he cause you
056403	
056404	
056405	to see?”
056406	He answered,
056407	
056408	“I told you
056409	
056410	already
056411	
056412	and you didn’t
056413	listen.
056414	Why
056415	it again?
056416	do you want
056417	to hear
056418	You people don’t
056419	
056420	
056421	want
056422	
056423	his disciples too, do you?”
056424	to become
056425	
056426	They heaped insults on him,
056427	
056428	
056429	saying,
056430	
056431	disciple!
056432	“You are

056463	a remarkable thing,

056466	
056467	that you don’t
056468	know
056469	where

056471	
056472	and yet he caused me
056473	
056474	
056475	to see!
056476	We know
056477	
056478	to sinners,
056479	
056480	that God
056481	doesn’t
056482	listen
056483	but
056484	if
056485	anyone

056512	
056513	he could
056514	do
056515	nothing.”
056516	They replied,
056517	
056518	
056519	
056520	in
056521	sinfulness,
056522	
056523	“You were born
056524	completely

056526	
056527	and yet you presume to teach us?”
056528

056536	that they had thrown him

056540	so he found
056541	
056542	the man and said to him,

056544	“Do you believe
056545	in
056546	
056547	the Son
056548	
056549	of Man?”

056731	
056732	
056733	this parable,
056734	told them
056735	
056736	
056737	Jesus
056738	
056739	but
056740	they did not
056741	understand
056742	what
056743	he was
056744	
056745	saying to them.
056746	
056747	“I tell you
056748	So
056749	again,
056750	
056751	Jesus
056752	the solemn
056753	truth,
056754	said

056771	and robbers,
056772	but

056794	and find

056798	comes
056799	
056800	only
056801	to

056804	and kill
056805	
056806	and destroy;
056807	
056808	I have come

056845	
056846	the wolf

056852	
056853	and runs away.
056854	
056855	
056856	So the wolf
056857	attacks
056858	
056859	
056860	the sheep and scatters them.
056861	
056862	a hired hand
056863	Because he is
056864	
056865	and is not
056866	concerned
056867	
056868	about

056870	the sheep, he runs away.
056871	
056872	“I am

056895	
056896	
056897	my life

056902	the sheep.
056903	
056904	other
056905	sheep
056906	I have
056907	that

056910	from
056911	
056912	this sheepfold.
056913	
056914	them too,
056915	I must
056916	
056917	bring
056918	
056919	
056920	to my voice,
056921	
056922	and they will listen

056924	so that there will be
056925	one
056926	flock
056927	and one
056928	shepherd.
056929	
056930	This is why
056931	
056932	
056933	the Father
056934	loves me –
056935	
056936	
056937	because I lay down

056939	my life,
056940	
056941	so that

056946	takes
056947	it away
056948	from me,

056973	
056974	sharp division
056975	Another
056976	took place
056977	among
056978	
056979	the Jewish people
056980	because of
056981	
056982	these words.
056983	
056984	were saying,

056996	Others

057039	
057040	“How long

057423	
057424	
057425	and Lazarus.)
057426	when
057427	So
057428	he heard
057429	that
057430	Lazarus was sick,
057431	
057432	
057433	he remained
057434	
057435	where
057436	he was
057437	in the place
057438	for two
057439	more days.
057440	Then
057441	after this,
057442	
057443	he said
057444	
057445	to his disciples,
057446	“Let us go
057447	to
057448	
057449	Judea
057450	again.”
057451	replied,
057452	
057453	
057454	The disciples
057455	“Rabbi,
057456	were just now
057457	trying
057458	you to death!
057459	to stone
057460	
057461	the Jewish leaders
057462	
057463	again?”
057464	Are you going
057465	there
057466	replied,
057467	Jesus
057468	there not
057469	twelve
057470	hours
057471	“Are
057472	
057473	in a day?
057474	If
057475	anyone
057476	walks around
057477	in
057478	
057479	the daytime,
057480	he does not
057481	stumble,
057482	
057483	
057484	the light
057485	
057486	of this world.
057487	
057488	because he sees
057489	if
057490	But
057491	anyone
057492	walks around
057493	at
057494	
057495	night,
057496	he stumbles,
057497	
057498	
057499	because the light
057500	not
057501	is
057502	in him.”
057503	
057504	
057505	he said this,
057506	
057507	After
057508	
057509	“Our friend
057510	
057511	Lazarus
057512	
057513	he added,
057514	
057515	has fallen asleep.
057516	But
057517	I am going
057518	there to
057519	awaken him.”
057520	
057521	replied,
057522	Then
057523	
057524	the disciples
057525	
057526	“Lord,
057527	if
057528	he has fallen asleep,
057529	he will recover.”
057530	had been talking
057531	(Now
057532	
057533	Jesus
057534	about
057535	
057536	his death,
057537	
057538	they
057539	but
057540	thought
057541	
057542	about
057543	
057544	real
057545	
057546	sleep.)
057547	he had been talking
057548	Then
057549	
057550	told them
057551	
057552	
057553	Jesus
057554	plainly,
057555	“Lazarus
057556	has died,
057557	
057558	and I am glad
057559	for
057560	your sake
057561	so that
057562	you may believe.
057563	
057564	not
057565	that I was
057566	there,
057567	But
057568	let us go
057569	to him.”
057570	
057571	said
057572	So
057573	Thomas
057574	
057575	(called
057576	Didymus)
057577	
057578	to his fellow disciples,
057579	“Let us go
057580	
057581	
057582	too, so that
057583	we may die
057584	with him.”
057585	
057586	arrived,
057587	
057588	
057589	When Jesus
057590	he found
057591	
057592	four
057593	already.
057594	days
057595	that Lazarus had been
057596	in
057597	
057598	the tomb
057599	was
057600	(Now
057601	
057602	Bethany
057603	less than
057604	
057605	from Jerusalem,
057606	
057607	
057608	
057609	two miles
057610	many
057611	so
057612	of
057613	
057614	the Jewish people
057615	of the region had come
057616	to
057617	
057618	Martha
057619	
057620	and Mary
057621	to
057622	console them
057623	
057624	over
057625	
057626	the loss of their brother.)
057627	
057628	So
057629	when Martha
057630	
057631	heard
057632	
057633	that Jesus
057634	was coming,
057635	she went out to meet him,
057636	
057637	Mary
057638	but
057639	in
057640	
057641	the house.
057642	was sitting
057643	said
057644	
057645	
057646	Martha
057647	to
057648	
057649	Jesus,
057650	“Lord,
057651	if
057652	you had been
057653	here,
057654	not
057655	would
057656	have died.
057657	
057658	my brother
057659	
057660	But
057661	
057662	even now
057663	I know
057664	
057665	that whatever
057666	
057667	you ask
057668	
057669	from God,
057670	will grant you.”
057671	
057672	
057673	God
057674	replied,
057675	
057676	
057677	Jesus
057678	will come back to life again.”
057679	
057680	“Your brother
057681	
057682	said,
057683	
057684	
057685	Martha
057686	“I know
057687	
057688	that he will come back to life again
057689	in
057690	
057691	the resurrection
057692	at
057693	
057694	the last
057695	day.”
057696	said to her,
057697	
057698	
057699	Jesus
057700	
057701	“I am
057702	
057703	the resurrection
057704	
057705	
057706	and the life.
057707	
057708	The one who believes
057709	in me
057710	
057711	even if
057712	he dies,
057713	will live
057714	
057715	
057716	
057717	and the one who lives
057718	
057719	and believes
057720	in me
057721	
057722	
057723	will never
057724	die.
057725	
057726	
057727	
057728	Do you believe this?”
057729	
057730	She replied,
057731	
057732	“Yes,
057733	Lord,
057734	
057735	I believe
057736	
057737	
057738	that you are
057739	
057740	the Christ,
057741	
057742	the Son
057743	
057744	of God
057745	
057746	into
057747	
057748	the world.”
057749	who comes
057750	
057751	
057752	And when she had said this,
057753	Martha went
057754	
057755	and called
057756	Mary,
057757	
057758	her sister
057759	
057760	privately,
057761	saying
057762	
057763	“The Teacher
057764	is here
057765	
057766	and is asking for you.”
057767	
057768	Mary
057769	So
057770	when
057771	heard
057772	this, she got up
057773	quickly
057774	
057775	and went
057776	to him.
057777	
057778	had not yet
057779	(Now
057780	entered
057781	
057782	Jesus
057783	
057784	
057785	the village,
057786	but
057787	was
057788	still
057789	in
057790	
057791	the place
057792	where
057793	had come out to meet him.)
057794	
057795	
057796	Martha
057797	
057798	Then
057799	the people
057800	
057801	who were
057802	with
057803	
057804	Mary in
057805	
057806	the house
057807	
057808	consoling her
057809	
057810	saw
057811	
057812	her
057813	
057814	quickly
057815	get up
057816	
057817	and go out.
057818	They followed her,
057819	
057820	because they thought
057821	
057822	she was going
057823	to
057824	
057825	the tomb
057826	to
057827	weep
057828	there.
057829	
057830	Now
057831	Mary
057832	when
057833	came
057834	to the place where
057835	was
057836	Jesus
057837	and saw him,
057838	
057839	she fell
057840	
057841	at
057842	
057843	his feet
057844	and said to him,
057845	
057846	“Lord,
057847	if
057848	you had been
057849	here,
057850	would not
057851	
057852	
057853	have died.”
057854	
057855	my brother
057856	Jesus
057857	
057858	When
057859	saw her
057860	
057861	weeping,
057862	
057863	
057864	and the people who had come with her
057865	
057866	
057867	weeping,
057868	he was intensely moved
057869	
057870	in spirit
057871	
057872	and greatly distressed.
057873	
057874	
057875	They replied,
057876	“Where
057877	have you laid him?”
057878	
057879	He asked,
057880	
057881	“Lord,
057882	come
057883	
057884	and see.”
057885	wept.
057886	
057887	Jesus
057888	who had come to mourn said,
057889	Thus
057890	
057891	the people
057892	“Look
057893	how much
057894	he loved him!”
057895	
057896	some
057897	But
057898	of them
057899	
057900	said,
057901	
057902	Couldn’t
057903	
057904	
057905	“This is the man who caused
057906	
057907	to see!
057908	
057909	the blind man
057910	he have done
057911	something to
057912	
057913	
057914	keep Lazarus from
057915	dying?”
057916	Jesus,
057917	
057918	again,
057919	intensely moved
057920	
057921	
057922	came
057923	to
057924	
057925	the tomb.
057926	it was
057927	(Now
057928	a cave,
057929	
057930	and a stone
057931	was placed
057932	across it.)
057933	
057934	said,
057935	
057936	Jesus
057937	“Take away
057938	
057939	the stone.”
057940	replied,
057941	
057942	
057943	the sister
057944	
057945	of the deceased,
057946	Martha,
057947	“Lord,
057948	by this time
057949	the body will have a bad smell,
057950	buried four days.”
057951	because
057952	he has been
057953	responded,
057954	
057955	
057956	Jesus
057957	“Didn’t
057958	I tell you
057959	
057960	
057961	that if
057962	you believe,
057963	you would see
057964	
057965	the glory
057966	
057967	of God?”
057968	they took away
057969	So
057970	
057971	the stone.
057972	
057973	
057974	Jesus
057975	
057976	
057977	looked
057978	upward
057979	
057980	and said,
057981	“Father,
057982	I thank
057983	
057984	
057985	you that you have listened to me.
057986	
057987	
057988	
057989	I knew
057990	
057991	that you always
057992	
057993	listen to me,
057994	but
057995	this for the sake of
057996	
057997	the crowd
057998	
057999	standing around
058000	I said
058001	here, that
058002	they may believe
058003	
058004	
058005	
058006	that you sent me.”
058007	
058008	
058009	When he had said
058010	voice,
058011	in a loud
058012	this, he shouted
058013	“Lazarus,
058014	come
058015	out!”
058016	came out,
058017	
058018	The one who had died
058019	tied up
058020	
058021	his feet
058022	
058023	
058024	and hands
058025	with strips of cloth,
058026	
058027	
058028	his face.
058029	
058030	and a cloth
058031	wrapped around
058032	said to them,
058033	
058034	
058035	Jesus
058036	“Unwrap him
058037	
058038	
058039	and let him
058040	
058041	go.”
058042	many
058043	Then
058044	of
058045	
058046	the people,
058047	
058048	who had come
058049	with
058050	
058051	Mary
058052	
058053	and had seen
058054	the things
058055	Jesus did,
058056	believed
058057	in him.
058058	
058059	some
058060	But
058061	of them
058062	
058063	went
058064	to
058065	
058066	the Pharisees
058067	
058068	and reported to them
058069	
058070	what
058071	had done.
058072	Jesus
058073	called
058074	So
058075	
058076	the chief priests
058077	
058078	
058079	and the Pharisees
058080	the council together
058081	
058082	and said,
058083	“What
058084	are we doing?
058085	
058086	
058087	
058088	For this man
058089	many
058090	is performing
058091	miraculous signs.
058092	If
058093	we allow him
058094	
058095	to go on in this way,
058096	everyone
058097	will believe
058098	in him,
058099	
058100	
058101	will come
058102	
058103	and the Romans
058104	
058105	and take away
058106	
058107	
058108	
058109	our sanctuary
058110	
058111	
058112	and our nation.”
058113	one
058114	Then
058115	
058116	of them,
058117	
058118	Caiaphas,
058119	who was high priest
058120	
058121	
058122	year,
058123	that
058124	said,
058125	
058126	
058127	at all!
058128	“You know
058129	nothing
058130	You do not
058131	realize
058132	
058133	that it is more
058134	to your advantage
058135	to
058136	have one
058137	man
058138	die
058139	for
058140	
058141	the people
058142	
058143	
058144	than for the whole
058145	
058146	nation
058147	to perish.”
058148	
058149	(Now
058150	this on
058151	his own,
058152	he did not
058153	say
058154	but
058155	high priest
058156	because he was
058157	
058158	year,
058159	that
058160	he prophesied
058161	
058162	was going to
058163	that Jesus
058164	die
058165	for
058166	
058167	the Jewish nation,
058168	
058169	and not
058170	for
058171	
058172	the Jewish nation
058173	only,
058174	but
058175	to
058176	
058177	
058178	the children
058179	
058180	of God
058181	
058182	who are scattered.)
058183	gather together
058184	into
058185	one
058186	from
058187	that
058188	So
058189	
058190	day
058191	they planned together
058192	to
058193	kill him.
058194	
058195	
058196	Thus
058197	Jesus
058198	no longer
058199	publicly
058200	went around
058201	among
058202	
058203	the Judeans,
058204	but
058205	went away
058206	from there
058207	to
058208	
058209	the region
058210	near
058211	
058212	the wilderness,
058213	to
058214	Ephraim,
058215	called
058216	a town
058217	and
058218	stayed there
058219	with
058220	
058221	his disciples.
058222	was
058223	Now
058224	near,
058225	
058226	Feast of Passover
058227	
058228	the Jewish
058229	
058230	went up
058231	and many people
058232	to
058233	Jerusalem
058234	from
058235	
058236	the rural areas
058237	before
058238	
058239	the Passover
058240	to
058241	cleanse
058242	themselves ritually.
058243	they were looking for
058244	Thus
058245	
058246	Jesus,
058247	
058248	and saying
058249	to
058250	one another
058251	in
058252	
058253	the temple courts,
058254	as they stood
058255	“What
058256	do you think?
058257	
058258	
058259	
058260	That he won’t
058261	come
058262	to
058263	
058264	the feast?”
058265	had given
058266	(Now
058267	
058268	the chief priests
058269	
058270	
058271	and the Pharisees
058272	orders
058273	that
058274	
058275	anyone
058276	who knew
058277	where
058278	Jesus was
058279	should report
058280	it, so that
058281	they could arrest him.)
058282	
058283	
058284	Then,
058285	Jesus
058286	before
058287	six
058288	days
058289	
058290	the Passover,
058291	came
058292	to
058293	Bethany,
058294	where
058295	lived,
058296	Lazarus
058297	whom
058298	had raised
058299	from
058300	the dead.
058301	he
058302	they prepared
058303	So
058304	
058305	a dinner
058306	for Jesus there.
058307	
058308	
058309	Martha
058310	was serving,
058311	
058312	and
058313	Lazarus
058314	
058315	was
058316	among
058317	
058318	those present at the table
058319	with him.
058320	
058321	
058322	Then
058323	Mary
058324	took
058325	three quarters of a pound
058326	aromatic oil
058327	nard
058328	from pure
058329	of expensive
058330	and anointed
058331	
058332	the feet
058333	
058334	of Jesus.
058335	
058336	She then wiped
058337	
058338	with her hair.
058339	
058340	
058341	his feet dry
058342	
058343	
058344	(Now
058345	the house
058346	was filled
058347	with
058348	
058349	the fragrance
058350	
058351	of the perfumed oil.)
058352	said,
058353	But
058354	Judas
058355	
058356	Iscariot,
058357	one
058358	of
058359	
058360	his disciples
058361	
058362	(the one who
058363	was going
058364	
058365	to betray him)
058366	
058367	“Why
058368	
058369	
058370	this oil
058371	wasn’t
058372	sold
058373	for three hundred
058374	silver coins
058375	
058376	and the money given
058377	to the poor?”
058378	Judas said
058379	(Now
058380	
058381	this not
058382	because
058383	about
058384	
058385	the poor,
058386	concerned
058387	he was
058388	but
058389	
058390	a thief.
058391	because he was
058392	
058393	
058394	of the money box,
058395	As keeper
058396	
058397	what was put into it.)
058398	he used to steal
058399	said,
058400	So
058401	
058402	Jesus
058403	“Leave her
058404	
058405	
058406	for
058407	
058408	the day
058409	
058410	of my burial.
058411	
058412	alone. She has kept it
058413	
058414	
058415	the poor
058416	For
058417	you will always
058418	have
058419	with
058420	you,
058421	
058422	but
058423	you will not
058424	always
058425	have me!”
058426	learned
058427	Now
058428	
058429	crowd
058430	a large
058431	of
058432	
058433	Judeans
058434	
058435	there,
058436	that Jesus was
058437	
058438	and so they came
058439	not
058440	because of
058441	
058442	him
058443	only
058444	but
058445	also to
058446	
058447	
058448	Lazarus
058449	see
058450	whom
058451	he had raised
058452	from
058453	the dead.
058454	planned
058455	So
058456	
058457	the chief priests
058458	to
058459	
058460	
058461	Lazarus too,
058462	kill
058463	
058464	many
058465	for on account of him
058466	
058467	from Jerusalem were going away
058468	
058469	of the Jewish people
058470	
058471	and believing
058472	in
058473	
058474	Jesus.
058475	
058476	The next day
058477	
058478	crowd
058479	the large
058480	
058481	that had come
058482	to
058483	
058484	the feast
058485	heard
058486	
058487	was coming
058488	
058489	that Jesus
058490	to
058491	Jerusalem.
058492	So they took
058493	
058494	branches
058495	
058496	of palm trees
058497	
058498	and went out
058499	to
058500	meet him.
058501	
058502	
058503	They began to shout,
058504	“Hosanna!
058505	Blessed
058506	
058507	is the one who comes
058508	in
058509	the name
058510	of the Lord!
058511	
058512	
058513	Blessed is the king
058514	
058515	of Israel!”
058516	found
058517	and
058518	
058519	Jesus
058520	a young donkey
058521	sat
058522	on it,
058523	
058524	just as
058525	it is
058526	written,
058527	“Do not
058528	be afraid,
058529	people
058530	of Zion;
058531	look,
058532	
058533	your king
058534	
058535	is coming,
058536	seated
058537	on
058538	s colt!”
058539	a donkey’
058540	
058541	did not
058542	understand these things
058543	
058544	
058545	(His disciples
058546	when
058547	they first happened,
058548	but
058549	when
058550	was glorified,
058551	Jesus
058552	then
058553	they remembered
058554	
058555	
058556	that these things were
058557	about him
058558	
058559	written
058560	
058561	
058562	and that these things had happened to him.)
058563	
058564	were continuing to testify about it.
058565	So
058566	
058567	the crowd
058568	
058569	who had been
058570	with him
058571	
058572	when
058573	
058574	Lazarus
058575	he called
058576	out of
058577	
058578	the tomb
058579	
058580	and raised him
058581	
058582	from
058583	the dead
058584	
058585	Because
058586	
058587	went out to meet him.
058588	
058589	
058590	the crowd
058591	
058592	they had heard
058593	
058594	
058595	that Jesus had performed
058596	
058597	this miraculous sign,
058598	
058599	Thus
058600	the Pharisees
058601	said
058602	to
058603	one another,
058604	“You see
058605	
058606	
058607	that you can do
058608	nothing.
058609	Look,
058610	
058611	the world
058612	after him!”
058613	
058614	has run off
058615	were
058616	Now
058617	Greeks
058618	some
058619	among
058620	
058621	those who had gone up
058622	to
058623	worship
058624	at
058625	
058626	the feast.
058627	
058628	So
058629	these approached
058630	Philip,
058631	
058632	who was from
058633	Bethsaida
058634	
058635	in Galilee,
058636	
058637	and requested,
058638	
058639	
058640	“Sir,
058641	we would like
058642	
058643	Jesus.”
058644	to see
058645	went
058646	
058647	Philip
058648	
058649	and told
058650	
058651	Andrew,
058652	and they both went
058653	
058654	
058655	
058656	
058657	and told
058658	
058659	Jesus.
058660	
058661	
058662	Jesus
058663	replied,
058664	
058665	
058666	has come
058667	
058668	“The time
058669	to
058670	be glorified.
058671	
058672	for the Son
058673	
058674	of Man
058675	the solemn
058676	truth,
058677	I tell you
058678	
058679	if
058680	unless
058681	
058682	a kernel
058683	
058684	of wheat
058685	falls
058686	into
058687	
058688	the ground
058689	and dies,
058690	
058691	by itself alone.
058692	it remains
058693	
058694	But
058695	it dies,
058696	much

058698	it produces
058699	
058700	The one who loves
058701	
058702	his life
058703	
058704	destroys
058705	
058706	
058707	
058708	it, and the one who hates
058709	
058710	his life
058711	
058712	in
058713	
058714	this world
058715	
058716	for
058717	life.
058718	eternal
058719	guards it
058720	
058721	If
058722	
058723	anyone
058724	wants to serve me,
058725	
058726	he must follow me,
058727	
058728	and where
058729	I am,

058731	
058732	
058733	
058734	servant
058735	
058736	my
058737	will be
058738	too. If
058739	anyone
058740	
058741	serves me,
058742	will honor him.
058743	
058744	
058745	the Father
058746	“Now
058747	
058748	my soul
058749	
058750	is greatly distressed.
058751	
058752	And what
058753	should I say?
058754	‘Father,
058755	deliver me
058756	
058757	from
058758	
058759	this hour’?
058760	
058761	No, but
058762	for
058763	
058764	this very reason I have come
058765	to
058766	
058767	this hour.
058768	
058769	Father,
058770	glorify
058771	
058772	
058773	your name.”
058774	came
058775	Then
058776	a voice
058777	from
058778	
058779	heaven,
058780	
058781	“I have glorified it,
058782	
058783	it again.”
058784	and I will glorify
058785	
058786	
058787	The crowd
058788	
058789	that stood
058790	
058791	there and heard
058792	the voice said
058793	
058794	that it had thundered.
058795	Others
058796	said
058797	that an angel
058798	
058799	had spoken to him.
058800	
058801	Jesus
058802	
058803	said,
058804	has not
058805	for
058806	
058807	
058808	“This voice
058809	
058810	come
058811	my benefit but
058812	for yours.
058813	
058814	Now
058815	the judgment
058816	is
058817	
058818	of this world;
058819	
058820	now
058821	
058822	the ruler
058823	
058824	of this world
058825	
058826	will be driven
058827	out.
058828	And I,
058829	when
058830	I am lifted up
058831	from
058832	
058833	the earth,
058834	all people
058835	will draw
058836	to
058837	myself.”
058838	
058839	(Now
058840	he said
058841	this to indicate clearly
058842	what kind
058843	of death
058844	he was going to
058845	die.)
058846	responded,
058847	Then
058848	
058849	
058850	the crowd
058851	
058852	“We have heard
058853	from
058854	
058855	the law
058856	
058857	
058858	that the Christ
058859	will remain
058860	
058861	
058862	forever.
058863	
058864	How
058865	can you say,
058866	
058867	
058868	must
058869	be lifted up’?
058870	
058871	‘The Son
058872	
058873	of Man
058874	Who
058875	is
058876	
058877	
058878	this Son
058879	
058880	of Man?”
058881	replied,
058882	
058883	
058884	
058885	Jesus
058886	longer.
058887	for a little
058888	while
058889	
058890	“The light
058891	with you
058892	
058893	is
058894	Walk
058895	while
058896	
058897	the light,
058898	you have
058899	so that
058900	may not
058901	the darkness
058902	
058903	overtake you.
058904	
058905	
058906	The one who walks
058907	in
058908	
058909	the darkness
058910	does not
058911	know
058912	where
058913	he is going.
058914	While
058915	
058916	the light,
058917	you have
058918	believe
058919	in
058920	
058921	the light,
058922	so that
058923	sons
058924	of light.”
058925	you may become
058926	
058927	had said
058928	When Jesus
058929	
058930	these things, he went away
058931	and hid
058932	himself from them.
058933	
058934	so many
058935	Although
058936	
058937	miraculous signs
058938	Jesus had performed
058939	before them,
058940	
058941	they still refused
058942	to believe
058943	in him,
058944	
058945	so that
058946	
058947	the word
058948	Isaiah
058949	
058950	of the prophet
058951	would be fulfilled.
058952	He
058953	said,
058954	“Lord,
058955	who
058956	has believed
058957	
058958	our message,
058959	
058960	
058961	
058962	has the arm
058963	of the Lord
058964	and to whom
058965	been revealed?”
058966	For
058967	
058968	not
058969	this reason they could
058970	believe,
058971	
058972	because again
058973	said,
058974	Isaiah
058975	“He has blinded
058976	
058977	
058978	their eyes
058979	
058980	and hardened
058981	
058982	
058983	their heart,
058984	so that
058985	they would not
058986	see
058987	
058988	with their eyes
058989	
058990	and understand
058991	
058992	with their heart,
058993	
058994	and turn to me,
058995	
058996	and I would heal them.”
058997	
058998	
058999	said
059000	Isaiah
059001	
059002	these things because he saw
059003	
059004	Christ’s glory,
059005	
059006	
059007	and spoke
059008	about him.
059009	
059010	Nevertheless,
059011	
059012	
059013	even among
059014	
059015	the rulers
059016	many
059017	believed
059018	in him,
059019	
059020	but
059021	because
059022	
059023	of the Pharisees
059024	they would not
059025	confess Jesus to be the Christ,
059026	so that
059027	they would not
059028	put out of the synagogue.
059029	be
059030	they loved
059031	For
059032	
059033	praise
059034	
059035	from men
059036	more
059037	than
059038	
059039	praise
059040	
059041	from God.
059042	Jesus
059043	But
059044	shouted out,
059045	
059046	
059047	
059048	“The one who believes
059049	in me
059050	
059051	does not
059052	believe
059053	in me,
059054	
059055	but
059056	in
059057	
059058	the one who sent me,
059059	
059060	
059061	
059062	and the one who sees me
059063	
059064	sees
059065	
059066	the one who sent me.
059067	
059068	
059069	as a light
059070	into
059071	
059072	the world,
059073	I have come
059074	so that
059075	everyone
059076	
059077	who believes
059078	in me
059079	
059080	in
059081	
059082	darkness.
059083	should not
059084	remain
059085	
059086	If
059087	anyone
059088	
059089	hears
059090	
059091	my words
059092	
059093	and does not
059094	obey them,
059095	
059096	I do not
059097	judge him.
059098	
059099	I have not
059100	For
059101	come
059102	to
059103	judge
059104	
059105	the world,
059106	but
059107	to
059108	save
059109	
059110	the world.
059111	
059112	The one who rejects me
059113	
059114	
059115	and does not
059116	accept
059117	
059118	my words
059119	
059120	has
059121	
059122	a judge;
059123	
059124	
059125	the word
059126	
059127	I have spoken
059128	
059129	will judge him
059130	
059131	at
059132	
059133	the last
059134	day.
059135	
059136	
059137	from
059138	my own
059139	For I have not
059140	spoken
059141	authority, but
059142	
059143	who sent me
059144	
059145	the Father himself
059146	
059147	
059148	
059149	has commanded me
059150	what
059151	I should say
059152	
059153	and what
059154	I should speak.
059155	
059156	And I know
059157	
059158	
059159	that his commandment
059160	
059161	life.
059162	eternal
059163	is
059164	the things
059165	Thus
059166	
059167	I say,
059168	just as
059169	has told me.”
059170	
059171	
059172	the Father
059173	
059174	I say
059175	Just before
059176	
059177	
059178	Feast,
059179	
059180	the Passover
059181	knew
059182	
059183	Jesus
059184	
059185	had come
059186	
059187	
059188	that his time
059189	to
059190	depart
059191	from
059192	
059193	this world
059194	
059195	to
059196	
059197	the Father.
059198	Having loved
059199	
059200	his own
059201	
059202	who were in
059203	
059204	the world,
059205	to
059206	the very end.
059207	he now loved them
059208	
059209	
059210	The evening meal
059211	was in progress,
059212	
059213	and the devil
059214	had already
059215	put
059216	into
059217	
059218	the heart
059219	son, that
059220	he should betray Jesus.
059221	
059222	of Judas
059223	Simon’s
059224	Iscariot,
059225	Because Jesus knew
059226	
059227	all things
059228	had handed over
059229	to him,
059230	
059231	that the Father
059232	
059233	
059234	
059235	
059236	
059237	from
059238	God
059239	and that he had come
059240	
059241	to
059242	
059243	God,
059244	and was going back
059245	he got up
059246	from
059247	
059248	the meal,
059249	
059250	removed
059251	
059252	his outer clothes,
059253	
059254	took
059255	a towel
059256	and tied it around
059257	himself.
059258	
059259	He poured
059260	water
059261	into
059262	
059263	the washbasin
059264	
059265	and began
059266	to wash
059267	
059268	feet
059269	
059270	the disciples’
059271	
059272	and to dry
059273	
059274	them with the towel
059275	
059276	he had
059277	wrapped around himself.
059278	he came
059279	Then
059280	to
059281	Simon
059282	Peter.
059283	Peter said to him,
059284	
059285	“Lord,
059286	
059287	
059288	are you going to wash
059289	
059290	my feet?”
059291	replied,
059292	Jesus
059293	
059294	
059295	
059296	what
059297	
059298	I am doing
059299	
059300	“You do not
059301	understand
059302	now,
059303	you will understand
059304	but
059305	after these things.”
059306	
059307	said to him,
059308	
059309	Peter
059310	no
059311	“You will never
059312	wash
059313	
059314	
059315	my feet!”
059316	
059317	
059318	
059319	replied,
059320	Jesus
059321	
059322	“If
059323	I do not
059324	wash you,
059325	
059326	
059327	you have
059328	share
059329	with me.”
059330	
059331	said to him,
059332	
059333	Simon
059334	Peter
059335	“Lord,
059336	wash not
059337	
059338	my feet,
059339	
059340	only
059341	but
059342	
059343	
059344	also my hands
059345	
059346	
059347	and my head!”
059348	replied,
059349	
059350	
059351	Jesus
059352	
059353	“The one who has bathed
059354	
059355	
059356	needs
059357	
059358	only
059359	
059360	his feet,
059361	to wash
059362	but
059363	is
059364	clean.
059365	completely
059366	
059367	
059368	clean,
059369	And you disciples are
059370	but
059371	not
059372	every one of you.”
059373	Jesus knew
059374	(For
059375	
059376	the one who was going to betray him.
059377	
059378	For
059379	
059380	this reason he said,
059381	
059382	“Not
059383	every one
059384	clean.”)
059385	of you is
059386	when
059387	So
059388	Jesus had washed
059389	
059390	their feet
059391	
059392	
059393	and put
059394	
059395	his outer clothing back on,
059396	
059397	
059398	he took his place at the table
059399	again
059400	and said to them,
059401	
059402	“Do you understand
059403	what
059404	I have done for you?
059405	
059406	
059407	You call me
059408	
059409	
059410	‘Teacher’
059411	
059412	
059413	and ‘Lord,’
059414	
059415	correctly,
059416	and do so
059417	that is what I am.
059418	for
059419	If
059420	I then,
059421	
059422	have washed
059423	
059424	
059425	your feet,
059426	
059427	your Lord
059428	
059429	
059430	and Teacher,
059431	
059432	
059433	you too ought to
059434	one another’s
059435	wash
059436	
059437	feet.
059438	an example –
059439	For
059440	I have given you
059441	
059442	
059443	just as
059444	
059445	you should do
059446	
059447	
059448	
059449	I have done for you.
059450	the solemn
059451	truth,
059452	I tell you
059453	
059454	not
059455	is
059456	the slave
059457	greater
059458	
059459	than his master,
059460	
059461	nor
059462	is the one who is sent as a messenger
059463	greater
059464	
059465	than the one who sent him.
059466	
059467	If
059468	
059469	you understand
059470	blessed
059471	these things, you will be
059472	if
059473	you do them.
059474	
059475	does not
059476	refer
059477	to all of you.
059478	
059479	“What I am saying
059480	
059481	I know
059482	the ones
059483	I have chosen.
059484	But
059485	this is to
059486	
059487	the scripture,
059488	fulfill
059489	
059490	‘The one who eats
059491	
059492	
059493	my bread
059494	
059495	against me.’
059496	
059497	
059498	has turned
059499	
059500	
059501	this now,
059502	I am telling you
059503	
059504	before
059505	
059506	it happens,
059507	so that
059508	you may believe
059509	when
059510	it happens
059511	
059512	
059513	that I am he.
059514	the solemn
059515	truth,
059516	I tell you
059517	
059518	
059519	whoever accepts
059520	
059521	the one
059522	I send
059523	
059524	accepts me,
059525	
059526	and
059527	
059528	whoever accepts me
059529	accepts
059530	
059531	the one who sent me.”
059532	
059533	
059534	
059535	
059536	these things, Jesus
059537	was greatly distressed
059538	
059539	in spirit,
059540	
059541	and testified,
059542	
059543	“I tell you
059544	the solemn
059545	truth,

059550	of
059551	
059552	you will betray me.”
059553	
059554	began to look
059555	at
059556	one another,
059557	
059558	The disciples
059559	worried and perplexed
059560	
059561	to know which
059562	of them he was talking about.
059563	was
059564	at the table to the right
059565	One
059566	of
059567	
059568	his disciples,
059569	
059570	in
059571	
059572	a place of honor.
059573	
059574	Jesus
059575	the one
059576	loved,
059577	
059578	of Jesus
059579	gestured
059580	So
059581	
059582	Simon
059583	Peter
059584	to this disciple to ask
059585	Jesus who
059586	
059587	it was
059588	
059589	
059590	he was referring to.
059591	the disciple whom Jesus loved leaned back
059592	Then
059593	
059594	
059595	against
059596	
059597	chest
059598	
059599	Jesus’
059600	and asked him,
059601	
059602	“Lord,
059603	who
059604	is it?”
059605	replied,
059606	
059607	Jesus
059608	“It
059609	is
059610	the one to whom
059611	
059612	after I have dipped
059613	
059614	this piece of bread
059615	
059616	I will give
059617	
059618	he dipped
059619	it in the dish.” Then
059620	
059621	the piece of bread
059622	
059623	
059624	in the dish and gave
059625	it to Judas
059626	Simon’s son.
059627	Iscariot,
059628	
059629	And after
059630	
059631	Judas took the piece of bread,
059632	
059633	entered
059634	into
059635	him.
059636	
059637	Satan
059638	said to him,
059639	
059640	
059641	
059642	Jesus
059643	“What
059644	you are about to do,
059645	do
059646	quickly.”
059647	
059648	(Now
059649	none
059650	understood
059651	
059652	of those present at the table
059653	
059654	why
059655	Jesus said this to Judas.
059656	
059657	Some
059658	that, because
059659	thought
059660	
059661	
059662	the money box,
059663	had
059664	Judas
059665	
059666	was telling him
059667	
059668	
059669	Jesus
059670	to buy
059671	whatever
059672	
059673	they needed
059674	for
059675	
059676	the feast,
059677	or
059678	to
059679	the poor.)
059680	to
059681	something
059682	give
059683	took
059684	
059685	
059686	the piece of bread
059687	Judas
059688	and went out
059689	immediately.
059690	it was
059691	(Now
059692	night.)
059693	When
059694	
059695	Judas had gone out,
059696	said,
059697	Jesus
059698	“Now
059699	is glorified,
059700	
059701	the Son
059702	
059703	of Man
059704	
059705	
059706	and God
059707	is glorified
059708	in him.
059709	
059710	If
059711	
059712	God
059713	is glorified
059714	in him,
059715	
059716	
059717	
059718	God
059719	will also glorify him
059720	
059721	in himself,
059722	
059723	
059724	right away.
059725	and he will glorify him
059726	
059727	Children,
059728	still
059729	for a little while.
059730	with you
059731	
059732	I am
059733	You will look for me,
059734	
059735	
059736	and just as
059737	I said
059738	
059739	to the Jewish religious leaders,
059740	
059741	‘Where
059742	
059743	I am going
059744	
059745	
059746	you cannot
059747	come,’
059748	
059749	
059750	I tell you the same.
059751	now
059752	commandment –
059753	a new
059754	“I give you
059755	
059756	to

059759	Just as
059760	I have loved you,

059780	said to him,
059781	
059782	Simon
059783	Peter
059784	“Lord,
059785	where
059786	are you going?”
059787	replied,
059788	
059789	Jesus
059790	“Where
059791	I am going,
059792	
059793	you cannot

059803	Peter
059804	“Lord,
059805	
059806	why

059808	can’t
059809	
059810	I follow you
059811	now?
059812	
059813	my life
059814	
059815	for you!”
059816	
059817	I will lay down
059818	answered,
059819	Jesus
059820	
059821	your life
059822	
059823	for me?
059824	
059825	“Will you lay down
059826	the solemn
059827	truth,

059834	until
059835	
059836	you have denied me

059838	three times!
059839	“Do not
059840	be distressed.
059841	
059842	
059843	let your hearts
059844	You believe

059858	dwelling places
059859	many
059860	There are
059861	
059862	
059863	Otherwise,
059864	I would have told you,

059866	
059867	
059868	because I am going away
059869	to make ready
059870	a place for you.
059871	
059872	
059873	And if

059876	and make ready
059877	a place for you,
059878	
059879	again
059880	I will come

059899	the way

059902	Thomas
059903	“Lord,

059966	Jesus
059967	for so
059968	long,

060634	I have loved you.
060635	
060636	greater
060637	
060638	love than this –
060639	No one

060657	what
060658	
060659	I command you.

060661	I no longer
060662	call you
060663	
060664	slaves,
060665	
060666	
060667	because the slave
060668	does not
060669	understand
060670	what
060671	is doing.
060672	
060673	
060674	his master
060675	
060676	But
060677	I have called you
060678	friends,
060679	
060680	everything
060681	
060682	I heard
060683	from
060684	
060685	my Father.
060686	
060687	because I have revealed to you
060688	
060689	You did not
060690	
060691	
060692	choose me,
060693	but
060694	
060695	I chose
060696	
060697	
060698	you and appointed you
060699	
060700	to
060701	
060702	go
060703	
060704	fruit,
060705	and bear
060706	
060707	
060708	fruit
060709	
060710	that remains,
060711	so that
060712	
060713	whatever
060714	
060715	you ask
060716	
060717	the Father
060718	in
060719	
060720	my name
060721	
060722	he will give you.
060723	
060724	
060725	This I command you –
060726	
060727	to
060728	love
060729	one another.
060730	“If
060731	
060732	the world
060733	
060734	hates you,
060735	be aware
060736	
060737	
060738	first.
060739	
060740	that it hated me
060741	If
060742	to
060743	
060744	the world,
060745	you belonged
060746	
060747	the world
060748	
060749	
060750	you as its own.
060751	would love
060752	
060753	However,
060754	to
060755	
060756	the world,
060757	because you do not
060758	belong
060759	but
060760	
060761	I chose you
060762	
060763	out of
060764	
060765	the world,
060766	for
060767	
060768	hates you.
060769	
060770	
060771	this reason the world
060772	Remember
060773	
060774	my word,
060775	what
060776	
060777	I told you,
060778	
060779	is not
060780	
060781	‘A slave
060782	greater
060783	
060784	than his master.’
060785	
060786	If
060787	
060788	they persecuted me,
060789	
060790	
060791	they will also persecute you.
060792	If
060793	
060794	
060795	
060796	they obeyed
060797	
060798	
060799	yours too.
060800	they will obey
060801	But
060802	
060803	all
060804	they will do
060805	these things to you
060806	
060807	on account of
060808	
060809	my name,
060810	
060811	
060812	because they do not
060813	know
060814	
060815	the one who sent me.
060816	
060817	If
060818	I had not
060819	come
060820	
060821	and spoken to them,
060822	
060823	of sin.
060824	they would not
060825	be guilty
060826	longer
060827	But
060828	any excuse
060829	they no
060830	have
060831	for
060832	
060833	their sin.
060834	
060835	
060836	
060837	The one who hates me
060838	
060839	
060840	my Father too.
060841	
060842	hates
060843	If
060844	
060845	the miraculous deeds
060846	I had not
060847	performed
060848	among them
060849	
060850	that
060851	no one
060852	else
060853	did,
060854	of sin.
060855	they would not
060856	be guilty
060857	now
060858	But
060859	
060860	they have seen
060861	
060862	the deeds and have hated
060863	
060864	
060865	
060866	
060867	both me and my Father.
060868	
060869	Now
060870	this happened to
060871	fulfill
060872	
060873	the word
060874	
060875	in
060876	
060877	their law,
060878	
060879	that is written
060880	
060881	‘They hated me
060882	
060883	without reason.’
060884	When
060885	comes,
060886	
060887	the Advocate
060888	whom
060889	
060890	I will send you
060891	
060892	from
060893	
060894	the Father –
060895	
060896	the Spirit
060897	
060898	of truth
060899	who
060900	from
060901	
060902	the Father –
060903	goes out
060904	
060905	he will testify
060906	about me,
060907	
060908	
060909	
060910	and you also
060911	will testify,
060912	
060913	from
060914	the beginning.
060915	with me
060916	
060917	because you have been
060918	
060919	“I have told you
060920	
060921	all these things so that
060922	you will not
060923	fall away.
060924	out of the synagogue,
060925	They will put you
060926	
060927	yet
060928	is coming
060929	a time
060930	
060931	
060932	
060933	when the one who kills
060934	
060935	you will think
060936	service
060937	he is offering
060938	
060939	to God.
060940	
060941	
060942	They will do these things
060943	because they have
060944	not
060945	known
060946	
060947	the Father
060948	or me.
060949	
060950	But
060951	
060952	I have told you
060953	
060954	these things so that
060955	when
060956	comes,
060957	
060958	their time

060969	you these things from
060970	the beginning
060971	about them. “I did not
060972	that I told you
060973	
060974	with you.
060975	
060976	because I was
060977	now
060978	But
060979	I am going
060980	to
060981	
060982	the one who sent me,
060983	
060984	
060985	and not one
060986	of
060987	
060988	you is asking me,
060989	
060990	‘Where
060991	are you going?’
060992	Instead
060993	
060994	
060995	because I have said these things to you.
060996	
060997	
060998	with sadness
060999	are filled
061000	
061001	
061002	your hearts
061003	But
061004	
061005	
061006	the truth,
061007	I tell you
061008	
061009	it is
061010	to your
061011	advantage that
061012	
061013	I am going away.
061014	if
061015	For
061016	I do not
061017	go away,
061018	
061019	the Advocate
061020	will not
061021	come
061022	to you,
061023	
061024	if
061025	but
061026	I go,
061027	I will send him
061028	
061029	to you.
061030	
061031	
061032	comes,
061033	And when he
061034	he will prove
061035	
061036	the world wrong
061037	concerning
061038	sin
061039	
061040	
061041	and righteousness
061042	
061043	
061044	and judgment –
061045	concerning
061046	sin,
061047	
061048	
061049	because they do not
061050	believe
061051	in me;
061052	
061053	concerning
061054	righteousness,
061055	
061056	
061057	to
061058	
061059	the Father
061060	because I am going
061061	
061062	no longer;
061063	and you will see me
061064	
061065	concerning
061066	and
061067	judgment,
061068	
061069	
061070	because the ruler
061071	
061072	of this world
061073	
061074	has been condemned.
061075	more things
061076	many
061077	“I have
061078	
061079	to say to you,
061080	but
061081	
061082	you cannot
061083	bear
061084	them now.
061085	when
061086	But
061087	comes,
061088	he,
061089	
061090	the Spirit
061091	
061092	of truth,
061093	he will guide you
061094	
061095	into
061096	
061097	truth.
061098	all
061099	he will not
061100	For
061101	speak
061102	on
061103	his own
061104	authority, but
061105	whatever
061106	he hears,
061107	will speak
061108	
061109	
061110	you what is to come.
061111	and will tell
061112	
061113	He
061114	
061115	will glorify me,
061116	
061117	from
061118	
061119	me
061120	because he will receive
061121	
061122	what is mine and will tell it to you.
061123	
061124	Everything
061125	that
061126	has
061127	
061128	the Father
061129	mine;
061130	is
061131	
061132	that is why
061133	I said
061134	
061135	from
061136	
061137	me what is mine
061138	the Spirit will receive
061139	
061140	and will tell it to you.
061141	
061142	In a little while
061143	
061144	no longer;
061145	you will see me
061146	
061147	
061148	again
061149	after a little while
061150	
061151	you will see me.”
061152	
061153	said
061154	Then
061155	some of
061156	
061157	his disciples
061158	
061159	to
061160	one another,
061161	“What
061162	is
061163	
061164	the meaning of what
061165	‘In a little while
061166	
061167	he is saying,
061168	
061169	you will not
061170	see me;
061171	
061172	
061173	again
061174	after a little while,
061175	
061176	you will see me,’
061177	
061178	
061179	
061180	and, ‘because I am going
061181	to
061182	
061183	the Father’?”
061184	they kept on repeating,
061185	So
061186	“What
061187	is
061188	
061189	the meaning of what
061190	he says,
061191	
061192	‘In a little while’?
061193	We do not
061194	understand
061195	what
061196	he is talking about.”
061197	could see
061198	
061199	Jesus
061200	
061201	that they wanted
061202	
061203	to ask him about these things,
061204	
061205	so he said to them,
061206	
061207	about this –
061208	
061209	“Are you asking
061210	each
061211	other
061212	
061213	that I said,
061214	‘In a little while
061215	
061216	you will not
061217	see me;
061218	
061219	
061220	again
061221	after a little while,
061222	
061223	you will see me’?
061224	
061225	the solemn
061226	truth,
061227	I tell you
061228	
061229	
061230	you will weep
061231	
061232	and wail,
061233	
061234	
061235	but
061236	the world
061237	will rejoice;
061238	
061239	you will be sad,
061240	but
061241	
061242	your sadness
061243	
061244	into
061245	joy.
061246	will turn
061247	
061248	a woman
061249	When
061250	gives birth,
061251	distress
061252	she has
061253	
061254	has come,
061255	
061256	because her time
061257	
061258	when
061259	but
061260	is born,
061261	
061262	her child
061263	she no longer
061264	remembers
061265	
061266	the suffering
061267	because of
061268	
061269	her joy
061270	
061271	has been born
061272	that a human being
061273	into
061274	
061275	the world.
061276	
061277	
061278	So also
061279	now,
061280	
061281	sorrow
061282	you have
061283	again,
061284	but
061285	I will see you
061286	
061287	
061288	will rejoice,
061289	
061290	
061291	and your hearts
061292	
061293	
061294	your joy away
061295	
061296	and no one
061297	will take
061298	from you.
061299	
061300	
061301	At
061302	that
061303	
061304	time
061305	
061306	
061307	you will ask me
061308	nothing.
061309	the solemn
061310	truth,
061311	I tell you
061312	
061313	
061314	whatever
061315	you ask
061316	
061317	the Father
061318	in
061319	
061320	my name
061321	
061322	he will give you.
061323	
061324	Until
061325	now
061326	you have not
061327	asked for
061328	anything
061329	in
061330	
061331	my name.
061332	
061333	Ask
061334	
061335	and you will receive
061336	it, so that
061337	
061338	your joy
061339	
061340	may be
061341	complete.
061342	
061343	these things in
061344	obscure figures of speech;
061345	“I have told you
061346	
061347	is coming
061348	a time
061349	when
061350	I will no longer
061351	in
061352	obscure figures,
061353	speak to you
061354	
061355	but
061356	plainly
061357	about
061358	
061359	the Father.
061360	will tell you
061361	
061362	At
061363	that
061364	
061365	time
061366	in
061367	
061368	my name,
061369	
061370	you will ask
061371	
061372	and I do not
061373	say
061374	
061375	
061376	
061377	that I will ask
061378	
061379	the Father
061380	on
061381	your behalf.
061382	
061383	For
061384	
061385	the Father himself
061386	loves you,
061387	
061388	
061389	
061390	
061391	because you have loved me
061392	
061393	and have believed
061394	
061395	
061396	from
061397	
061398	God.
061399	that I came
061400	I came
061401	from
061402	
061403	the Father
061404	
061405	and entered
061406	into
061407	
061408	the world,
061409	but in turn,
061410	I am leaving
061411	
061412	the world
061413	
061414	and going back
061415	to
061416	
061417	the Father.”
061418	said,
061419	
061420	His disciples
061421	
061422	“Look,
061423	now
061424	
061425	plainly
061426	you are speaking
061427	
061428	in obscure figures of speech!
061429	and not
061430	
061431	Now
061432	we know
061433	
061434	that you know
061435	everything
061436	
061437	and do not
061438	
061439	need
061440	
061441	anyone
061442	
061443	to ask you
061444	anything. Because of
061445	
061446	this we believe
061447	
061448	from
061449	God.”
061450	that you have come
061451	replied,
061452	
061453	Jesus
061454	“Do you now
061455	believe?
061456	Look,
061457	is coming –
061458	a time
061459	
061460	and has come –
061461	
061462	when you will be scattered,
061463	each one
061464	to
061465	
061466	his own home,
061467	and I
061468	alone.
061469	will be left
061470	
061471	not
061472	Yet I am
061473	alone,
061474	
061475	
061476	because my Father
061477	with me.
061478	
061479	is
061480	
061481	I have told you
061482	
061483	these things so that
061484	in me
061485	
061486	peace.
061487	you may have
061488	In
061489	
061490	the world
061491	trouble and suffering,
061492	you have
061493	but
061494	take courage –
061495	
061496	I have conquered
061497	
061498	the world.”
061499	
061500	had finished saying
061501	When Jesus
061502	
061503	
061504	
061505	these things, he looked upward
061506	
061507	to
061508	
061509	heaven
061510	and said,
061511	“Father,
061512	has come.
061513	
061514	the time
061515	Glorify
061516	
061517	
061518	your Son,
061519	so that
061520	
061521	your Son
061522	may glorify you –
061523	
061524	just as
061525	you have given him
061526	
061527	authority
061528	over all
061529	humanity,
061530	so that
061531	to everyone
061532	
061533	he may give
061534	
061535	you have given him.
061536	
061537	life
061538	eternal
061539	
061540	Now
061541	this is
061542	
061543	eternal
061544	life –
061545	that
061546	they know you,

061550	true
061551	God,
061552	
061553	whom
061554	you sent.
061555	and Jesus
061556	Christ,
061557	
061558	
061559	I glorified you
061560	on
061561	
061562	earth
061563	
061564	the work
061565	by completing
061566	
061567	you gave me
061568	
061569	to
061570	do.
061571	
061572	And now,
061573	glorify me

061576	Father,
061577	at
061578	your side
061579	
061580	with the glory
061581	
061582	I had
061583	before
061584	
061585	
061586	the world
061587	was created.
061588	with you
061589	
061590	“I have revealed
061591	
061592	
061593	your name
061594	
061595	to the men

061597	you gave me

061673	
061674	and I have been glorified
061675	by them.
061676	
061677	
061678	no longer
061679	I am
061680	in
061681	
061682	the world,
061683	
061684	
061685	in
061686	
061687	the world,
061688	but they are
061689	and I
061690	to you.
061691	
061692	am coming
061693	Father,
061694	Holy
061695	keep
061696	them safe
061697	in
061698	
061699	your name
061700	
061701	that
061702	you have given me,
061703	
061704	so that
061705	they may be
061706	one
061707	just as
061708	we are one.
061709	When
061710	I was
061711	with them
061712	
061713	
061714	I kept
061715	them safe
061716	them in
061717	
061718	your name
061719	
061720	that
061721	you have given me.
061722	
061723	
061724	and watched over
061725	
061726	Not one
061727	of them
061728	
061729	was lost
061730	
061731	except
061732	
061733	the one destined
061734	
061735	for destruction,
061736	so that
061737	
061738	the scripture
061739	could be fulfilled.
061740	now
061741	But
061742	to you,
061743	
061744	I am coming
061745	
061746	
061747	and I am saying
061748	these things in
061749	
061750	the world,
061751	so
061752	they may experience
061753	
061754	joy
061755	
061756	my
061757	completed
061758	in
061759	themselves.
061760	
061761	I have given them
061762	
061763	
061764	your word,
061765	
061766	
061767	
061768	and the world
061769	has hated them,
061770	
061771	
061772	because they do not
061773	belong
061774	to
061775	
061776	the world,
061777	just as
061778	
061779	I do not
061780	belong
061781	to
061782	
061783	the world.
061784	I am not
061785	asking
061786	you to
061787	take them
061788	
061789	out of
061790	
061791	the world,
061792	but
061793	that
061794	you keep
061795	them safe
061796	from
061797	
061798	the evil one.
061799	to
061800	
061801	the world
061802	They do not
061803	belong
061804	just as

061806	I do not
061807	belong
061808	to

061810	the world.
061811	Set
061812	them apart
061813	in
061814	
061815	the truth;
061816	
061817	word
061818	
061819	your
061820	truth.
061821	is
061822	Just as
061823	
061824	you sent me
061825	into
061826	
061827	the world,
061828	so I
061829	sent them
061830	
061831	into
061832	
061833	the world.
061834	
061835	on
061836	their behalf,
061837	
061838	And I set
061839	myself apart
061840	so that
061841	may be
061842	too
061843	they
061844	set apart.
061845	
061846	truly
061847	“I am not
061848	on
061849	their behalf,
061850	
061851	praying
061852	only
061853	but

061878	
061879	in us,

061884	the world
061885	will believe
061886	
061887	
061888	
061889	that you sent me.
061890	
061891	
061892	The glory
061893	
061894	you gave to me
061895	
061896	I have given to them,
061897	
061898	that
061899	they may be
061900	one
061901	just as
061902	
061903	we are one –

061912	that they may be
061913	completely
061914	
061915	one,
061916	
061917	will know

061921	
061922	
061923	that you sent me,
061924	
061925	and you have loved them

061929	you have loved me.
061930	“Father,
061931	those

061952	
061953	because you loved me
061954	
061955	before
061956	the creation
061957	of the world.
061958	Father,
061959	Righteous
061960	
061961	
061962	even if the world
061963	
061964	does not
061965	know you,
061966	
061967	
061968	
061969	I know you,
061970	
061971	
061972	and these men know
061973	
061974	
061975	
061976	that you sent me.
061977	
061978	I made known
061979	
061980	
061981	your name to them,
061982	
061983	
061984	and I will continue to make it known,
061985	so that
061986	
061987	the love
061988	
061989	you have loved me
061990	
061991	in them,
061992	
061993	with may be
061994	and I
061995	may be in them.”
061996	
061997	
061998	When he had said
061999	these things, Jesus
062000	went out
062001	with
062002	
062003	his disciples
062004	
062005	across
062006	
062007	Valley.
062008	
062009	the Kidron
062010	There
062011	was
062012	an orchard there, and he
062013	
062014	
062015	went into it.
062016	
062017	
062018	
062019	and his disciples
062020	
062021	knew
062022	(Now
062023	
062024	Judas,
062025	
062026	the one who betrayed him,
062027	
062028	
062029	the place
062030	
062031	many times
062032	had met
062033	too, because Jesus
062034	there
062035	with
062036	
062037	his disciples.)
062038	
062039	
062040	So
062041	Judas
062042	obtained
062043	
062044	a squad of soldiers
062045	
062046	of
062047	
062048	the chief priests
062049	
062050	
062051	
062052	and Pharisees.
062053	and some officers
062054	They came
062055	to the orchard
062056	with
062057	lanterns
062058	
062059	and torches
062060	
062061	and weapons.
062062	Jesus,
062063	Then
062064	because he knew
062065	everything
062066	
062067	happen
062068	that was going to
062069	to him,
062070	came
062071	
062072	and asked them,
062073	
062074	“Who
062075	are you looking for?”
062076	They replied,
062077	
062078	“Jesus
062079	
062080	the Nazarene.”
062081	He told them,
062082	
062083	
062084	“I am
062085	was standing
062086	he.” (Now
062087	
062088	Judas,
062089	
062090	the one who betrayed him,
062091	
062092	there with them.)
062093	
062094	when
062095	So
062096	Jesus said to them,
062097	
062098	
062099	“I am
062100	
062101	
062102	
062103	he,” they retreated
062104	
062105	and fell
062106	to the ground.
062107	again,
062108	Then
062109	Jesus asked them
062110	
062111	“Who
062112	are you looking for?”
062113	
062114	And
062115	they said,
062116	“Jesus
062117	
062118	the Nazarene.”
062119	replied,
062120	Jesus
062121	“I told you
062122	
062123	
062124	
062125	
062126	that I am he. If
062127	
062128	
062129	you are looking for me,
062130	let
062131	
062132	these men go.”
062133	He said this to
062134	fulfill
062135	
062136	the word
062137	
062138	he had spoken,
062139	
062140	whom
062141	you gave me.”
062142	
062143	
062144	lost a single one
062145	of
062146	those
062147	“I have not

062150	Peter,
062151	who had
062152	a sword,
062153	pulled
062154	it out
062155	
062156	and struck
062157	
062158	
062159	the high priest’s
062160	slave,

062175	But
062176	
062177	Jesus
062178	
062179	to Peter,
062180	“Put
062181	
062182	your sword
062183	back into

062185	its sheath!

062211	
062212	and tied
062213	him up.

062380	
062381	in
062382	secret.
062383	I have said
062384	nothing
062385	Why
062386	
062387	do you ask me?
062388	Ask
062389	
062390	those who heard
062391	what
062392	I said.
062393	
062394	
062395	
062396	They know
062397	what
062398	I said.”
062399	
062400	
062401	
062402	
062403	When Jesus had said this,
062404	one
062405	who stood nearby
062406	
062407	of the high priest’s officers
062408	struck
062409	on the face
062410	
062411	him
062412	and said,
062413	“Is that the way
062414	you answer
062415	
062416	the high priest?”
062417	replied,
062418	
062419	Jesus
062420	“If
062421	something wrong,
062422	I have said
062423	confirm
062424	what is
062425	
062426	wrong.
062427	if
062428	But
062429	I spoke correctly,
062430	why
062431	
062432	strike me?”
062433	sent him,
062434	Then
062435	
062436	
062437	Annas
062438	still tied up,
062439	to
062440	Caiaphas
062441	
062442	the high priest.
062443	was
062444	Meanwhile
062445	Simon
062446	Peter
062447	standing
062448	
062449	in the courtyard warming himself.
062450	They said to him,
062451	
062452	
062453	aren’t
062454	
062455	“You
062456	one of
062457	
062458	his disciples
062459	
062460	too, are
062461	you?” Peter
062462	it:
062463	
062464	denied
062465	not!”
062466	“I am
062467	said,
062468	One

062473	the high priest’s
062474	a relative

062481	“Did I not
062482	
062483	
062484	see you
062485	in
062486	
062487	the orchard
062488	with him?”
062489	
062490	it again,
062491	Then
062492	denied
062493	Peter

062506	
062507	the Roman governor’s residence.
062508	it was
062509	(Now
062510	very early morning.)
062511	
062512	
062513	They did not
062514	go into
062515	
062516	
062517	the governor’s residence
062518	so
062519	they would not
062520	be ceremonially defiled,
062521	but
062522	could eat
062523	
062524	the Passover meal.

062528	Pilate
062529	outside
062530	to them
062531	
062532	
062533	and said,
062534	“What
062535	accusation
062536	do you bring
062537	against
062538	
062539	this man?”
062540	
062541	They replied,
062542	
062543	
062544	
062545	“If
062546	not
062547	this man were

062549	a criminal,

062565	according to
062566	
062567	your own law!”
062568	
062569	yourselves and pass judgment on him

062571	replied,
062572	
062573	
062574	The Jewish leaders
062575	
062576	“We cannot
062577	legally
062578	put
062579	anyone to death.”
062580	(This happened to
062581	
062582	the word

062586	
062587	had spoken
062588	when he indicated

062591	he was going
062592	to die.)
062593	went
062594	So
062595	back
062596	into
062597	
062598	the governor’s residence,
062599	
062600	Pilate
062601	
062602	summoned
062603	
062604	Jesus,
062605	
062606	and asked him,
062607	
062608	
062609	“Are you
062610	
062611	the king
062612	
062613	of the Jews?”
062614	replied,
062615	Jesus
062616	this on
062617	own initiative,
062618	your
062619	
062620	“Are you saying
062621	or
062622	have others
062623	told you
062624	
062625	about me?”
062626	
062627	answered,
062628	
062629	Pilate
062630	not

062638	and
062639	your
062640	chief priests
062641	handed
062642	you over to me.
062643	
062644	What
062645	have you done?”
062646	replied,
062647	Jesus
062648	
062649	kingdom
062650	
062651	“My
062652	not
062653	is
062654	from

062656	this world.
062657	
062658	If

062673	
062674	
062675	from
062676	being handed over
062677	
062678	to the Jewish authorities.
062679	as it is,
062680	But
062681	
062682	kingdom
062683	
062684	my

062697	replied,
062698	
062699	Jesus
062700	
062701	that I am
062702	
062703	a king.
062704	“You say
062705	
062706	For
062707	
062708	this reason I was born,
062709	
062710	and for
062711	
062712	this reason I came
062713	into
062714	
062715	the world –
062716	to
062717	testify
062718	
062719	to the truth.
062720	Everyone
062721	
062722	who belongs
062723	to
062724	
062725	the truth
062726	listens
062727	
062728	
062729	to my voice.”
062730	asked,
062731	
062732	
062733	Pilate
062734	“What
062735	is
062736	truth?”
062737	
062738	
062739	When he had said this
062740	back outside
062741	he went
062742	to
062743	
062744	the Jewish leaders
062745	
062746	“I find
062747

062749	no
062750	and announced,
062751	against him.
062752	
062753	basis for an accusation
062754	it is
062755	But
062756	your custom
062757	
062758	that
062759	one prisoner for you
062760	I release
062761	
062762	at
062763	
062764	the Passover.
062765	do you want
062766	So
062767	me to release for you
062768	
062769	
062770	the king
062771	
062772	of the Jews?”
062773	they shouted
062774	Then
062775	back,
062776	
062777	“Not
062778	
062779	this man, but
062780	
062781	Barabbas!”
062782	was
062783	(Now
062784	
062785	Barabbas
062786	a revolutionary.)
062787	Then
062788	
062789	took
062790	
062791	Pilate
062792	
062793	Jesus
062794	
062795	and had him flogged severely.
062796	
062797	
062798	The soldiers
062799	braided
062800	a crown
062801	of
062802	thorns
062803	and put it on
062804	
062805	
062806	his head,
062807	
062808	robe.
062809	in a purple
062810	and they clothed him
062811	
062812	
062813	They came up
062814	to him
062815	
062816	
062817	again and again and said,
062818	“Hail,
062819	
062820	king
062821	
062822	of the Jews!”
062823	
062824	And they struck him
062825	
062826	repeatedly in the face.
062827	
062828	
062829	Again
062830	went out
062831	
062832	Pilate
062833	
062834	and said
062835	
062836	to the Jewish leaders, “Look,
062837	I am bringing him
062838	
062839	
062840	out to you,
062841	so that
062842	you may know
062843	
062844	no
062845	reason for an accusation
062846	that I find
062847	against him.”
062848	
062849	came
062850	So
062851	
062852	Jesus
062853	outside,
062854	wearing
062855	
062856	of thorns

062860	and the purple
062861	robe.
062862	
062863	Pilate said to them,
062864	
062865	“Look,
062866	
062867	here is the man!”
062868	When
062869	
062870	saw him,
062871	
062872	
062873	the chief priests
062874	
062875	
062876	and their officers
062877	they shouted out,
062878	said,
062879	“Crucify him!
062880	Crucify him!”
062881	
062882	
062883	
062884	Pilate
062885	“You take him
062886	
062887	
062888	
062889	and crucify him!
062890	
062891	Certainly

062894	against him!”
062895	
062896	reason for an accusation
062897	replied,
062898	
062899	
062900	The Jewish leaders
062901	
062902	a law,
062903	“We have
062904	
062905	and according to
062906	
062907	our law
062908	he ought
062909	to die,
062910	
062911	to be the Son
062912	of God!”
062913	
062914	because he claimed
062915	When
062916	
062917	heard
062918	
062919	Pilate
062920	
062921	
062922	what they said,
062923	he was more
062924	afraid than ever,
062925	
062926	and he went back
062927	into
062928	
062929	the governor’s residence
062930	
062931	
062932	and said
062933	
062934	to Jesus,
062935	“Where
062936	do you come from?”
062937	
062938	
062939	But
062940	Jesus
062941	answer.
062942	no
062943	gave him
062944	
062945	said,
062946	So
062947	
062948	
062949	Pilate
062950	
062951	“Do you refuse
062952	to speak to me?
062953	Don’t
062954	you know
062955	
062956	the authority
062957	I have
062958	to release you,
062959	
062960	
062961	
062962	
062963	and to crucify you?”
062964	
062965	replied,
062966	
062967	Jesus
062968	no
062969	“You would have
062970	authority
062971	over me
062972	
062973	at all,
062974	
062975	unless
062976	it was
062977	given to you
062978	
062979	from above.
062980	
062981	Therefore
062982	
062983	the one who handed
062984	me over to you
062985	
062986	of greater
062987	sin.”
062988	is guilty
062989	From
062990	
062991	
062992	this point on, Pilate
062993	tried
062994	to release him.
062995	
062996	
062997	But
062998	the Jewish leaders
062999	shouted out,
063000	
063001	“If
063002	
063003	you release
063004	no
063005	this man, you are
063006	friend

063017	
063018	When
063019	Pilate
063020	heard
063021	
063022	these words
063023	
063024	he brought
063025	outside
063026	
063027	Jesus
063028	
063029	and sat down
063030	on
063031	the judgment seat
063032	in
063033	the place
063034	called
063035	“The Stone Pavement”
063036	in Aramaic).
063037	
063038	(Gabbatha
063039	it was
063040	(Now
063041	the day of preparation
063042	
063043	for the Passover,
063044	
063045	
063046	about
063047	noon.)
063048	
063049	Pilate said
063050	
063051	to the Jewish leaders,
063052	“Look,
063053	
063054	here is your king!”
063055	
063056	they shouted out,
063057	Then
063058	
063059	“Away with
063060	him! Away with
063061	him! Crucify him!”
063062	
063063	asked,
063064	
063065	
063066	Pilate
063067	
063068	your king?”
063069	
063070	“Shall I crucify

063072	
063073	The high priests
063074	no
063075	“We have
063076	king
063077	
063078	except
063079	Caesar!”
063080	Then
063081	So
063082	Pilate handed
063083	him over
063084	to them
063085	to
063086	be crucified.
063087	they took
063088	
063089	
063090	Jesus,
063091	
063092	and carrying
063093	his own
063094	
063095	cross
063096	he went out
063097	to
063098	
063099	the place called
063100	of the Skull”
063101	“The Place
063102	
063103	(called
063104	in Aramaic
063105	Golgotha).
063106	There
063107	
063108	they crucified him
063109	
063110	along with
063111	
063112	others,
063113	two
063114	one on each side,
063115	
063116	
063117	in the middle.
063118	
063119	
063120	with Jesus
063121	written
063122	
063123	also had
063124	a notice
063125	
063126	Pilate
063127	
063128	and fastened
063129	to
063130	
063131	the cross,
063132	
063133	
063134	which read:
063135	“Jesus
063136	
063137	the Nazarene,
063138	
063139	the king
063140	
063141	of the Jews.”
063142	
063143	Thus
063144	
063145	this notice,
063146	many
063147	read
063148	
063149	of the Jewish residents of Jerusalem
063150	
063151	near
063152	was
063153	
063154	because the place
063155	
063156	the city,
063157	where
063158	was crucified
063159	
063160	Jesus
063161	
063162	and the notice was
063163	written
063164	in Aramaic,
063165	Latin,
063166	and Greek.
063167	said
063168	Then
063169	
063170	to Pilate,
063171	
063172	the chief priests
063173	
063174	of the Jews
063175	“Do not
063176	write,
063177	
063178	‘The king
063179	
063180	of the Jews,’
063181	but
063182	
063183	rather, ‘This man
063184	said,
063185	king
063186	I am
063187	
063188	of the Jews.’”
063189	answered,
063190	
063191	Pilate
063192	“What
063193	I have written,
063194	I have written.”
063195	
063196	Now
063197	the soldiers
063198	when
063199	crucified
063200	
063201	Jesus,
063202	they took
063203	
063204	his clothes
063205	
063206	
063207	and made
063208	four
063209	shares,
063210	one for each
063211	soldier,
063212	
063213	
063214	
063215	and the tunic remained.
063216	
063217	(Now
063218	
063219	the tunic
063220	was seamless,
063221	from
063222	
063223	top
063224	woven
063225	to bottom as
063226	a single piece.)
063227	the soldiers said
063228	So
063229	to
063230	one another,
063231	“Let’s not
063232	tear it,
063233	
063234	but
063235	throw dice
063236	
063237	
063238	to see who
063239	will get
063240	it.” This took place to
063241	
063242	the scripture
063243	fulfill
063244	
063245	“They divided
063246	that says,
063247	
063248	my garments
063249	
063250	among them,
063251	
063252	and for
063253	
063254	my clothing
063255	
063256	they threw
063257	dice.”
063258	
063259	
063260	So
063261	the soldiers
063262	
063263	did these things.
063264	standing
063265	Now
063266	beside
063267	
063268	cross
063269	
063270	Jesus’
063271	
063272	were his mother,
063273	
063274	
063275	
063276	sister,
063277	
063278	his mother’s
063279	
063280	Mary
063281	
063282	
063283	the wife of Clopas,
063284	
063285	and Mary
063286	
063287	Magdalene.
063288	when Jesus
063289	So
063290	saw
063291	
063292	his mother
063293	
063294	
063295	and the disciple
063296	standing there,
063297	whom
063298	he loved
063299	he said
063300	
063301	to his mother,
063302	“Woman,
063303	look,
063304	
063305	here is your son!”
063306	
063307	He then
063308	said
063309	
063310	to his disciple,
063311	“Look,
063312	
063313	here is your mother!”
063314	
063315	
063316	From
063317	that
063318	
063319	very time
063320	took her
063321	
063322	the disciple
063323	
063324	into
063325	
063326	his own home.
063327	After
063328	
063329	realizing
063330	
063331	this Jesus,
063332	
063333	that by this time
063334	everything
063335	was completed,
063336	(in order to
063337	fulfill
063338	
063339	the scripture),
063340	said
063341	“I am thirsty!”
063342	A jar
063343	was there,
063344	of sour wine
063345	full
063346	a sponge
063347	
063348	soaked
063349	in
063350	sour wine
063351	on a branch of hyssop
063352	so they put
063353	and lifted
063354	
063355	
063356	it to his mouth.
063357	When
063358	
063359	he had received
063360	
063361	the sour wine,
063362	
063363	Jesus
063364	said,
063365	“It is completed!”
063366	
063367	Then he bowed
063368	
063369	his head
063370	and gave up
063371	
063372	his spirit.
063373	
063374	Then,
063375	one), the Jewish leaders
063376	because
063377	the day of preparation,
063378	it was
063379	so that
063380	should not
063381	stay
063382	on
063383	
063384	the crosses
063385	
063386	the bodies
063387	on
063388	
063389	the Sabbath
063390	was
063391	(for
063392	an especially important
063393	
063394	
063395	that
063396	
063397	Sabbath
063398	asked
063399	
063400	Pilate
063401	to
063402	broken
063403	
063404	
063405	have the victims’ legs
063406	
063407	and the bodies taken down.
063408	came
063409	So
063410	the
063411	soldiers
063412	
063413	
063414	
063415	first
063416	and broke
063417	the
063418	legs
063419	the one and then
063420	
063421	the other.
063422	of the two men who
063423	had been crucified with Jesus,
063424	
063425	to
063426	But
063427	
063428	Jesus
063429	they came
063430	when
063431	and saw
063432	that he was already
063433	
063434	dead,
063435	they did not
063436	break
063437	
063438	
063439	his legs.
063440	But
063441	one
063442	
063443	of the soldiers
063444	with a spear,
063445	
063446	
063447	his side
063448	pierced
063449	
063450	flowed out
063451	immediately.
063452	and blood
063453	
063454	and water
063455	
063456	
063457	And the person who saw
063458	it has testified
063459	
063460	true,
063461	
063462	is
063463	
063464	(and his testimony
063465	
063466	and he
063467	knows
063468	that he
063469	the truth),
063470	is telling
063471	so that
063472	
063473	
063474	you also may believe.
063475	these things happened
063476	For
063477	
063478	so that
063479	
063480	the scripture
063481	would be fulfilled,
063482	a bone
063483	“Not
063484	of his will be broken.”
063485	
063486	
063487	And again
063488	another
063489	scripture
063490	says,
063491	“They will look
063492	on
063493	the one whom
063494	they have pierced.”
063495	After this,
063496	
063497	
063498	asked
063499	
063500	Pilate
063501	Joseph
063502	
063503	of
063504	Arimathea,
063505	
063506	a disciple
063507	
063508	of Jesus
063509	secretly,
063510	(but
063511	because
063512	
063513	he feared
063514	
063515	the Jewish leaders),
063516	
063517	if he could remove
063518	
063519	the body
063520	
063521	of Jesus.
063522	
063523	gave him permission,
063524	
063525	Pilate
063526	he went
063527	so
063528	
063529	and took
063530	
063531	the body away.
063532	
063533	come
063534	
063535	
063536	Nicodemus,
063537	
063538	
063539	to
063540	
063541	Jesus at night,
063542	
063543	the man who had previously
063544	accompanied Joseph, carrying
063545	a mixture
063546	of myrrh
063547	
063548	and aloes
063549	weighing about
063550	pounds.
063551	seventy-five
063552	they took
063553	Then
063554	
063555	body
063556	
063557	Jesus’
063558	
063559	and wrapped it,
063560	
063561	in strips of linen cloth
063562	with
063563	
063564	the aromatic spices,
063565	according to
063566	customs.
063567	
063568	
063569	Jewish
063570	burial
063571	Jesus was
063572	Now
063573	at
063574	
063575	the place
063576	where
063577	crucified
063578	there was a garden,
063579	
063580	and in
063581	
063582	the garden
063583	tomb
063584	was a new
063585	
063586	where
063587	had yet
063588	no one
063589	
063590	been buried.
063591	
063592	And so,
063593	because it was
063594	
063595	day of preparation
063596	
063597	the Jewish
063598	
063599	nearby,
063600	was
063601	
063602	and the tomb
063603	they placed
063604	
063605	Jesus’ body there.
063606	
063607	Now
063608	on the first
063609	
063610	day of the week,
063611	Mary
063612	
063613	Magdalene
063614	came
063615	very early
063616	dark,
063617	still
063618	while it was
063619	to
063620	
063621	the tomb
063622	
063623	and saw
063624	
063625	that the stone
063626	had been moved away
063627	from
063628	
063629	the entrance.
063630	running
063631	So
063632	
063633	she went
063634	to
063635	Simon
063636	Peter
063637	
063638	
063639	
063640	and the other
063641	disciple
063642	whom
063643	loved
063644	
063645	Jesus
063646	
063647	and told them,
063648	
063649	“They have taken
063650	
063651	the Lord
063652	from
063653	
063654	the tomb,
063655	
063656	and we don’t
063657	know
063658	where
063659	they have put him!”
063660	
063661	set out
063662	Then
063663

063668	disciple
063669	
063670	to go
063671	to
063672	
063673	the tomb.
063674	were running
063675	
063676	
063677	The two
063678	together,
063679	
063680	
063681	but the other
063682	disciple
063683	ran
063684	faster
063685	
063686	than Peter
063687	
063688	and reached
063689	first.
063690

063693	
063694	He bent down

063699	he did not
063700	there, but
063701	go in.
063702	arrived
063703	Then
063704	
063705	Simon
063706	Peter,
063707	who had been following him,
063708	
063709	
063710	and went
063711	right into
063712	
063713	the tomb.
063714	
063715	He saw
063716	
063717	the strips of linen cloth
063718	lying there,
063719	
063720	
063721	and the face cloth,
063722	which
063723	had been
063724	around
063725	
063726	Jesus’ head,
063727	
063728	not
063729	with
063730	
063731	the strips of linen cloth
063732	lying
063733	but
063734	by itself.
063735	rolled up
063736	
063737	in a
063738	place
063739	Then
063740	
063741	who had reached
063742	
063743	
063744	the other

063752	
063753	and he saw
063754	
063755	and believed.
063756	they did not yet

063758	understand
063759	
063760	the scripture
063761	
063762	that Jesus must

063771	
063772	
063773	the disciples
063774	Mary
063775	But
063776	stood
063777	
063778	
063779	the tomb
063780	outside
063781	weeping.
063782	As
063783	
063784	she wept,
063785	she bent down and looked
063786	into
063787	
063788	the tomb.
063789	
063790	And she saw
063791	two
063792	angels
063793	in
063794	white
063795	sitting
063796	one
063797	at
063798	
063799	the head
063800	
063801	and one
063802	at
063803	
063804	the feet.
063805	where
063806	had been lying,
063807	
063808	body
063809	
063810	Jesus’
063811	
063812	They said to her,
063813	
063814	
063815	“Woman,
063816	why
063817	are you weeping?”
063818	Mary replied,
063819	
063820	
063821	“They have taken
063822	
063823	my Lord away,
063824	
063825	
063826	and I do not
063827	know
063828	where
063829	they have put him!”
063830	
063831	
063832	When she had said
063833	this, she turned around
063834	
063835	
063836	
063837	
063838	and saw
063839	
063840	Jesus
063841	standing there,
063842	
063843	but she did not
063844	know
063845	
063846	Jesus.
063847	that it was
063848	said to her,
063849	
063850	Jesus
063851	“Woman,
063852	why
063853	are you weeping?
063854	Who
063855	are you looking for?”
063856	Because she
063857	thought
063858	
063859	
063860	the gardener,
063861	he was
063862	she said to him,
063863	
063864	“Sir,
063865	if
063866	
063867	you have carried
063868	him away,
063869	tell me
063870	
063871	where
063872	you have put him,
063873	
063874	and I
063875	
063876	will take him.”
063877	said to her,
063878	
063879	Jesus
063880	“Mary.”
063881	turned
063882	She
063883	and said to him
063884	
063885	in Aramaic,
063886	“Rabboni”
063887	(which
063888	means
063889	Teacher).
063890	replied,
063891	
063892	Jesus
063893	“Do not
063894	
063895	touch me,
063896	I have not yet
063897	for
063898	ascended
063899	to
063900	
063901	my Father.
063902	Go
063903	
063904	to
063905	
063906	my brothers
063907	
063908	
063909	and tell them,
063910	
063911	‘I am ascending
063912	to
063913	
063914	my Father
063915	
063916	
063917	and your Father,
063918	
063919	
063920	to my God
063921	
063922	
063923	and your God.’”
063924	
063925	came
063926	Mary
063927	
063928	Magdalene
063929	and informed
063930	the
063931	disciples,
063932	
063933	“I have seen
063934	
063935	the Lord!”
063936	And
063937	she told them what
063938	Jesus had said
063939	to her.
063940	
063941	
063942	On the evening
063943	
063944	day,
063945	of that
063946	
063947	the first day
063948	of the week,
063949	
063950	
063951	the doors
063952	had gathered together and locked
063953	
063954	
063955	
063956	the disciples
063957	of the place because
063958	
063959	they were afraid
063960	
063961	of the Jewish leaders.
063962	came
063963	
063964	Jesus
063965	
063966	and stood
063967	
063968	
063969	among
063970	
063971	them and said to them,
063972	
063973	“Peace be with you.”
063974	
063975	
063976	
063977	When he had said
063978	this, he showed them
063979	
063980	his hands
063981	
063982	
063983	and his side.
063984	
063985	rejoiced
063986	Then
063987	
063988	the disciples
063989	when they saw
063990	
063991	the Lord.
063992	said to them
063993	So
063994	
063995	
063996	Jesus
063997	again,
063998	“Peace be with you.
063999	
064000	Just as
064001	has sent me,
064002	
064003	
064004	the Father
064005	I also
064006	send you.”
064007	
064008	
064009	
064010	And after he said this,
064011	he breathed
064012	
064013	“Receive
064014	
064015	on them and said,
064016	Spirit.
064017	the Holy
064018	
064019	anyone’s
064020	If you forgive
064021	
064022	sins,
064023	they are forgiven;
064024	
064025	if
064026	anyone’s sins,
064027	you retain
064028	they are retained.”
064029	Thomas
064030	Now
064031	one
064032	of
064033	
064034	the twelve,
064035	
064036	(called
064037	Didymus),
064038	not
064039	was
064040	with them
064041	
064042	when
064043	came.
064044	Jesus
064045	told him,
064046	
064047	
064048	
064049	The other
064050	disciples
064051	“We have seen
064052	
064053	the Lord!”
064054	
064055	But
064056	he replied,
064057	
064058	
064059	“Unless
064060	I see
064061	in
064062	
064063	his hands,
064064	
064065	
064066	the wounds
064067	
064068	from the nails
064069	
064070	and put
064071	
064072	my finger
064073	
064074	into
064075	
064076	the wounds
064077	
064078	from the nails,
064079	
064080	and put
064081	
064082	
064083	my hand
064084	into
064085	
064086	his side,
064087	
064088	never
064089	believe it!”
064090	I will
064091	
064092	later
064093	days
064094	Eight
064095	again
064096	were
064097	together in the house,
064098	
064099	the disciples
064100	
064101	
064102	and Thomas
064103	was with them.
064104	
064105	came
064106	
064107	Jesus
064108	
064109	Although the doors
064110	were locked,
064111	
064112	and stood
064113	among
064114	
064115	
064116	
064117	them and said,
064118	“Peace be with you!”
064119	
064120	Then
064121	he said
064122	
064123	to Thomas,
064124	“Put
064125	
064126	your finger
064127	
064128	here,
064129	
064130	and examine
064131	
064132	my hands.
064133	
064134	
064135	Extend
064136	
064137	your hand
064138	
064139	
064140	and put
064141	it into
064142	
064143	my side.
064144	
064145	
064146	Do not
064147	continue
064148	in your unbelief,
064149	but
064150	believe.”
064151	replied to him,
064152	Thomas
064153	
064154	
064155	
064156	
064157	“My Lord
064158	
064159	
064160	
064161	and my God!”
064162	
064163	said to him,
064164	
064165	
064166	Jesus
064167	
064168	because you have seen me?
064169	
064170	“Have you believed
064171	Blessed
064172	
064173	are the people who have not
064174	seen
064175	
064176	and yet have believed.”
064177	many
064178	
064179	Now
064180	
064181	other
064182	miraculous signs
064183	performed
064184	
064185	Jesus
064186	in the presence of
064187	
064188	the disciples,
064189	
064190	which
064191	not
064192	are
064193	recorded
064194	in
064195	
064196	this book.
064197	
064198	
064199	But
064200	these are recorded
064201	so that
064202	you may believe
064203	
064204	that Jesus
064205	is
064206	
064207	the Christ,
064208	
064209	the Son
064210	
064211	of God,
064212	
064213	and that
064214	by believing
064215	life
064216	you may have
064217	in
064218	
064219	his name.
064220	
064221	After
064222	
064223	revealed
064224	himself
064225	again
064226	
064227	this Jesus
064228	
064229	to the disciples
064230	by
064231	
064232	the Sea
064233	
064234	of Tiberias.
064235	he did so.
064236	Now
064237	this is how
064238	of his were
064239	together.
064240	Simon
064241	Peter,
064242	
064243	Thomas
064244	
064245	(called
064246	Didymus),
064247	
064248	Nathanael
064249	
064250	(who was from
064251	Cana
064252	
064253	in Galilee),
064254	
064255	
064256	
064257	the sons of Zebedee,
064258	
064259	other
064260	
064261	
064262	disciples
064263	
064264	and two
064265	told them,
064266	
064267	Simon
064268	Peter
064269	“I am going
064270	fishing.”
064271	they replied.
064272	
064273	“We will go
064274	
064275	
064276	with you,”
064277	
064278	They went out
064279	
064280	and got
064281	into
064282	
064283	the boat,
064284	
064285	
064286	but that
064287	
064288	night
064289	they caught
064290	nothing.
064291	very early morning,
064292	
064293	already
064294	When it was
064295	stood
064296	Jesus
064297	on
064298	
064299	the beach,
064300	did not
064301	but
064302	know
064303	
064304	the disciples
064305	
064306	Jesus.
064307	that it was
064308	said to them,
064309	So
064310	
064311	
064312	Jesus
064313	“Children,
064314	you don’t
064315	any
064316	fish,
064317	have
064318	do you?” They replied,
064319	
064320	“No.”
064321	
064322	
064323	He told them,
064324	
064325	“Throw
064326	on
064327	
064328	the right
064329	side
064330	
064331	of the boat,
064332	
064333	your net
064334	
064335	and you will find
064336	they threw the net,
064337	some.” So
064338	
064339	and were not
064340	
064341	to pull
064342	able
064343	
064344	
064345	it in because of the large number
064346	
064347	of fish.
064348	said
064349	Then
064350	
064351	the disciple
064352	
064353	whom
064354	loved
064355	
064356	Jesus
064357	
064358	to Peter,
064359	
064360	the Lord!”
064361	“It is
064362	Simon
064363	So
064364	Peter,
064365	when he heard
064366	
064367	
064368	the Lord,
064369	that it was
064370	
064371	in his outer garment
064372	tucked
064373	he had
064374	(for
064375	nothing on underneath it),
064376	
064377	and plunged
064378	
064379	into
064380	
064381	the sea.
064382	
064383	Meanwhile
064384	the other
064385	disciples
064386	
064387	with the boat,
064388	came
064389	not
064390	for
064391	they were
064392	far
064393	from
064394	
064395	land,
064396	only
064397	about
064398	
064399	
064400	a hundred yards.
064401	dragging
064402	
064403	the net
064404	
064405	full of fish,
064406	When
064407	
064408	they got out
064409	on
064410	
064411	the beach,
064412	they saw
064413	a charcoal fire
064414	ready
064415	
064416	with a fish
064417	placed on it,
064418	
064419	and bread.
064420	said,
064421	
064422	
064423	Jesus
064424	“Bring
064425	some of
064426	
064427	the fish
064428	
064429	caught.”
064430	you have just now
064431	went aboard
064432	So
064433	Simon
064434	Peter
064435	
064436	and pulled
064437	
064438	the net
064439	to
064440	
064441	shore.
064442	It was full
064443	fish,
064444	of large
064445	one hundred
064446	fifty-
064447	three,
064448	
064449	so many,
064450	but although there were
064451	was not
064452	torn.
064453	
064454	the net
064455	said.
064456	
064457	
064458	Jesus
064459	“Come,
064460	have breakfast,”
064461	none
064462	But
064463	dared
064464	
064465	of the disciples
064466	to ask him,
064467	
064468	
064469	“Who
064470	are you?”
064471	because they knew
064472	
064473	
064474	the Lord.
064475	it was
064476	came
064477	Jesus
064478	
064479	and took
064480	
064481	the bread
064482	
064483	and gave it to them,
064484	
064485	
064486	
064487	with the fish.
064488	and did the same
064489	
064490	This was now
064491	the third time
064492	was revealed
064493	Jesus
064494	
064495	to the disciples
064496	after he was raised
064497	from
064498	the dead.
064499	when
064500	Then
064501	they had finished breakfast,
064502	said
064503	
064504	to Simon
064505	Peter,
064506	
064507	Jesus
064508	“Simon,
064509	son of John,
064510	do you love me
064511	
064512	more
064513	
064514	than these do?” He replied,
064515	
064516	“Yes,
064517	Lord,
064518	
064519	you know
064520	
064521	I love you.”
064522	
064523	Jesus told him,
064524	
064525	“Feed
064526	
064527	my lambs.”
064528	
064529	Jesus said
064530	
064531	
064532	a second time,
064533	“Simon,
064534	son of John,
064535	do you love me?”
064536	
064537	He replied,
064538	
064539	“Yes,
064540	Lord,
064541	
064542	you know
064543	
064544	I love you.”
064545	
064546	Jesus told him,
064547	
064548	“Shepherd
064549	
064550	my sheep.”
064551	
064552	Jesus said
064553	
064554	
064555	a third time,
064556	“Simon,
064557	son of John,
064558	do you love me?”
064559	
064560	was distressed
064561	
064562	Peter
064563	
064564	and said,
064565	
064566	
064567	a third time,
064568	“Do you love me?”
064569	
064570	
064571	that Jesus asked him
064572	
064573	“Lord,
064574	everything.
064575	
064576	you know
064577	
064578	You know
064579	
064580	that I love you.”
064581	
064582	“Feed
064583	
064584	
064585	
064586	Jesus replied,
064587	
064588	my sheep.
064589	
064590	the solemn
064591	truth,
064592	I tell you
064593	
064594	when
064595	you were
064596	young,
064597	you tied your clothes around
064598	you
064599	
064600	and went
064601	wherever
064602	you wanted,
064603	when
064604	but
064605	you are old,
064606	you will stretch out
064607	
064608	your hands,
064609	
064610	
064611	and others
064612	you up
064613	will tie
064614	
064615	and bring you
064616	where
064617	you do not
064618	want to go.”
064619	
064620	(Now
064621	Jesus said
064622	this to indicate clearly
064623	by what kind
064624	of death
064625	Peter was going to glorify
064626	
064627	God.)
064628	
064629	
064630	After he said this,
064631	Jesus told Peter,
064632	
064633	“Follow me.”
064634	
064635	turned around
064636	
064637	Peter
064638	and saw
064639	
064640	the disciple
064641	whom
064642	loved
064643	
064644	Jesus
064645	following
064646	them. (This was the disciple who
064647	
064648	had leaned back
064649	at
064650	
064651	the meal
064652	against
064653	
064654	Jesus’ chest
064655	
064656	
064657	and asked,
064658	“Lord,
064659	who
064660	is
064661	the one who
064662	is going to betray you?”)
064663	
064664	
064665	So
064666	saw
064667	
064668	when Peter
064669	him, he asked
064670	
064671	Jesus,
064672	“Lord,
064673	
064674	
064675	what about him?”
064676	replied,
064677	
064678	
064679	Jesus
064680	“If
064681	
064682	I want him
064683	to live
064684	until
064685	I come back,
064686	what
064687	concern is that of yours?
064688	
064689	
064690	
064691	You follow me!”
064692	circulated
064693	So
064694	
064695	
064696	the saying
064697	among
064698	
064699	the brothers
064700	
064701	
064702	disciple
064703	and sisters that this
064704	was not
064705	going to die.
064706	did not
064707	say to him
064708	But
064709	
064710	
064711	Jesus
064712	
064713	that he was not
064714	going to die,
064715	but rather,
064716	“If
064717	
064718	I want him
064719	to live
064720	until
064721	I come back,
064722	what concern is that of yours?”
064723	
064724	
064725	
064726	This is
064727	
064728	the disciple
064729	
064730	who testifies
064731	about
064732	
064733	
064734	
064735	these things and has written
064736	
064737	
064738	these things, and we know
064739	
064740	true.
064741	
064742	
064743	that his testimony
064744	is
064745	There are
064746	
064747	
064748	other things
064749	many
064750	that
064751	did.
064752	
064753	Jesus
064754	
064755	If
064756	of them were written down,
064757	every
064758	one
064759	would not
064760	
064761	I suppose
064762	
064763	the whole world
064764	have room
064765	
064766	that would be written.
064767	for the books
064768	
064769	
064770	the former
064771	account,
064772	I wrote
064773	about
064774	all
064775	
064776	Theophilus,
064777	that
064778	began
064779	
064780	Jesus
064781	to do
064782	
064783	
064784	and teach
064785	until
064786	
064787	the day
064788	to heaven, after he had given orders
064789	
064790	to the apostles
064791	by
064792	Spirit
064793	the Holy
064794	
064795	he had chosen.
064796	he was taken up
064797	To the same apostles
064798	
064799	he presented
064800	himself
064801	alive
064802	also, after
064803	
064804	his suffering,
064805	
064806	with
064807	many
064808	convincing proofs.
064809	
064810	day
064811	over a forty-
064812	He was seen by them
064813	
064814	
064815	period and spoke
064816	
064817	about matters concerning
064818	
064819	the kingdom
064820	
064821	of God.
064822	
064823	While he was with them,
064824	he declared,
064825	
064826	
064827	Jerusalem,
064828	“Do not
064829	leave
064830	but
064831	wait
064832	
064833	promised,
064834	
064835	there for what my Father
064836	which
064837	you heard about from me.
064838	
064839	
064840	For John
064841	
064842	baptized
064843	with water,
064844	
064845	but
064846	with
064847	Spirit
064848	you will be baptized
064849	the Holy
064850	not
064851	from now.”
064852	many
064853	
064854	days
064855	
064856	
064857	So
064858	when they had gathered together,
064859	they began to ask him,
064860	
064861	
064862	“Lord,
064863	
064864	
064865	
064866	is this the time
064867	
064868	when you are restoring
064869	
064870	the kingdom
064871	
064872	to Israel?”
064873	He told them,
064874	
064875	
064876	
064877	not
064878	
064879	“You are
064880	permitted to know
064881	the times
064882	or
064883	periods
064884	that
064885	
064886	the Father
064887	has set by
064888	
064889	
064890	his own
064891	authority.
064892	But
064893	you will receive
064894	power
064895	has come
064896	
064897	when the Holy
064898	Spirit
064899	upon you,
064900	
064901	
064902	and you will be
064903	
064904	my witnesses
064905	in
064906	
064907	Jerusalem,
064908	
064909	and in
064910	all
064911	
064912	Judea
064913	
064914	and Samaria,
064915	
064916	and to
064917	the farthest parts
064918	
064919	of the earth.”
064920	
064921	
064922	After he had said
064923	this, while they were watching,
064924	
064925	he was lifted up
064926	
064927	and a cloud
064928	hid him
064929	
064930	from
064931	
064932	their sight.
064933	
064934	
064935	As
064936	still staring
064937	they were
064938	into
064939	
064940	the sky
064941	while he was going,
064942	
064943	
064944	suddenly
064945	men
064946	two
064947	stood near them
064948	
064949	in
064950	clothing
064951	white
064952	
064953	
064954	and said,
064955	“Men
064956	of Galilee,
064957	why
064958	do you stand here
064959	looking up
064960	into
064961	
064962	the sky?
064963	
064964	
064965	This same Jesus
064966	
064967	who has been taken up
064968	from you
064969	
064970	into
064971	
064972	heaven
064973	
064974	will come back
064975	
064976	in the same way
064977	you saw him
064978	
064979	go
064980	into
064981	
064982	heaven.”
064983	Then
064984	they returned
064985	to
064986	Jerusalem
064987	from
064988	the mountain
064989	
064990	called
064991	the Mount of Olives
064992	(which
064993	is
064994	near
064995	Jerusalem,
064996	a Sabbath
064997	
064998	day’s journey away).
064999	
065000	When
065001	they had entered
065002	
065003	
065004	to the upstairs room
065005	Jerusalem, they went
065006	where
065007	they were
065008	staying.
065009	
065010	
065011	Peter
065012	
065013	and John,
065014	
065015	and James,
065016	
065017	and Andrew,
065018	Philip
065019	
065020	and Thomas,
065021	Bartholomew
065022	
065023	and Matthew,
065024	James
065025	son of Alphaeus
065026	
065027	and Simon
065028	
065029	the Zealot,
065030	
065031	and Judas
065032	son of James were there.
065033	
065034	All
065035	
065036	these continued
065037	together
065038	
065039	in prayer with one mind,
065040	together with
065041	the women,
065042	along with
065043	Mary
065044	
065045	the mother
065046	
065047	of Jesus,
065048	
065049	
065050	and his brothers.
065051	
065052	
065053	In
065054	
065055	those days
065056	
065057	stood up
065058	Peter
065059	among
065060	
065061	
065062	the believers
065063	and said
065064	
065065	
065066	(a gathering
065067	,
065068	
065069	
065070	
065071	of about
065072	one hundred
065073	and twenty people)
065074	
065075	“Brothers,
065076	had to be
065077	fulfilled
065078	
065079	the scripture
065080	
065081	foretold
065082	
065083	Spirit
065084	
065085	that the Holy
065086	through
065087	
065088	David
065089	concerning
065090	Judas –
065091	
065092	who became
065093	the guide
065094	
065095	for those who arrested
065096	Jesus –
065097	
065098	counted as one of us
065099	for he was
065100	
065101	
065102	
065103	and received
065104	
065105	a share
065106	
065107	in this ministry.”
065108	
065109	
065110	
065111	(Now
065112	this man Judas acquired
065113	a field
065114	with
065115	the reward
065116	
065117	of his unjust deed,
065118	
065119	headfirst
065120	and falling
065121	he burst open
065122	in the middle
065123	
065124	gushed out.
065125	and all
065126	
065127	his intestines

065132	to all
065133	
065134	who lived
065135	in Jerusalem,
065136	so that
065137	they called
065138	
065139	that field

065142	in their own
065143	language

065145	Hakeldama,
065146	
065147	that is,
065148	“Field
065149	of Blood.”)
065150	it is written
065151	“For
065152	in
065153	the book
065154	of Psalms,
065155	become
065156

065204	
065205	of his resurrection
065206	
065207	together with us.”
065208	
065209	of these must become
065210	one
065211	
065212	
065213	So they proposed
065214	two
065215	candidates: Joseph
065216	
065217	called
065218	Barsabbas
065219	
065220	(also called
065221	Justus)
065222	
065223	and Matthias.
065224	
065225	Then they prayed,
065226	
065227	
065228	“Lord, you
065229	know the hearts
065230	of all.
065231	Show
065232	us which
065233	you have chosen
065234	of
065235	
065236	
065237	these two
065238	one
065239	to assume
065240	
065241	the task
065242	
065243	of this service
065244	
065245	
065246	and apostleship
065247	from
065248	which
065249	turned aside
065250	Judas
065251	to go
065252	to
065253	
065254	place.”
065255	
065256	his own
065257	
065258	Then they cast
065259	lots for them,
065260	
065261	
065262	
065263	
065264	and the one chosen
065265	
065266	was Matthias;
065267	
065268	so he was counted
065269	with
065270	
065271	the eleven
065272	apostles.
065273	
065274	Now when
065275	
065276	had come,
065277	
065278	the day
065279	
065280	of Pentecost
065281	they were
065282	all
065283	together
065284	in one place.
065285	
065286	
065287	
065288	came
065289	Suddenly
065290	from
065291	
065292	heaven
065293	a sound
065294	like
065295	blowing
065296	wind
065297	a violent
065298	
065299	and filled
065300	the entire
065301	
065302	house
065303	where
065304	they were
065305	sitting.
065306	
065307	appeared to them
065308	
065309	spreading out
065310	And tongues
065311	like
065312	a fire
065313	
065314	and came to rest
065315	on
065316	one of them.
065317	each
065318	
065319	
065320	of them were filled
065321	All
065322	Spirit,
065323	with the Holy
065324	
065325	and they began
065326	to speak
065327	in other
065328	languages
065329	as
065330	
065331	the Spirit
065332	
065333	enabled them.
065334	
065335	there were
065336	Now
065337	in
065338	Jerusalem.
065339	residing
065340	Jews

065343	from
065344	every
065345	nation

065347	under
065348	
065349	heaven
065350	occurred,
065351	
065352	
065353	When this sound
065354	
065355	gathered
065356	
065357	a crowd
065358	
065359	and was in confusion,
065360	
065361	heard them
065362	one
065363	because each

065368	
065369	Completely baffled,
065370	
065371	
065372	
065373	they said,
065374	“Aren’t

065383	And how
065384	
065385	hears
065386	is it that each one of us

065476	his voice,

065511	
065512	this is

065626	“Men
065627	of Israel,
065628	listen
065629	
065630	to these words:
065631	
065632	Jesus
065633	
065634	the Nazarene,
065635	a man
065636	clearly attested
065637	by
065638	
065639	God
065640	to you
065641	
065642	with powerful deeds,
065643	
065644	wonders,
065645	
065646	and miraculous signs
065647	that

065651	
065652	God
065653	
065654	among you
065655	
065656	just as
065657	
065658	you yourselves know –
065659	this man,
065660	who
065661	the predetermined
065662	plan
065663	
065664	and foreknowledge
065665	
065666	of God,
065667	was handed over
065668	by
065669	at the hands
065670	of Gentiles.
065671	by nailing him to a cross
065672	you executed
065673	him up,
065674	
065675	But God
065676	raised
065677	having released
065678	
065679	him from the pains
065680	
065681	of death,
065682	because
065683	not
065684	it was
065685	possible for him
065686	to be held
065687	
065688	in its power.
065689	
065690	David
065691	For
065692	says
065693	about him,
065694	
065695	‘I saw
065696	
065697	the Lord
065698	in front of me,
065699	
065700	
065701	always
065702	
065703	at
065704	my right hand
065705	
065706	for he is
065707	so that
065708	I will not
065709	be shaken.
065710	
065711	Therefore
065712	was glad
065713	
065714	my heart
065715	
065716	
065717	rejoiced;

065719	and my tongue
065720	
065721	
065722	
065723	
065724	
065725	my body
065726	
065727	also will live
065728	in
065729	hope,
065730	
065731	because you will not
065732	leave
065733	
065734	my soul
065735	
065736	in
065737	Hades,
065738	nor
065739	permit
065740	
065741	your Holy One
065742	
065743	to experience
065744	decay.
065745	You have made known to me
065746	
065747	the paths
065748	of life;
065749	you will make me
065750	
065751	full of joy
065752	with
065753	
065754	your presence.’
065755	
065756	
065757	“Brothers,
065758	I can
065759	speak
065760	
065761	confidently
065762	to you
065763	
065764	about
065765	
065766	our forefather
065767	David,
065768	
065769	
065770	that he both died
065771	
065772	and was buried,
065773	
065774	
065775	and his tomb
065776	
065777	is
065778	with us
065779	
065780	to
065781	
065782	this day.
065783	
065784	a prophet
065785	So then,
065786	because he was
065787	
065788	and knew
065789	
065790	with an oath
065791	had sworn to him
065792	
065793	
065794	that God
065795	one of
065796	
065797	
065798	his descendants
065799	
065800	to seat
065801	on
065802	
065803	his throne,
065804	
065805	David by foreseeing
065806	this spoke
065807	about
065808	
065809	the resurrection
065810	
065811	of the Christ,
065812	
065813	that he was neither
065814	abandoned
065815	to
065816	Hades,
065817	nor
065818	
065819	did his body
065820	
065821	experience
065822	decay.
065823	
065824	
065825	This Jesus
065826	raised up,
065827	
065828	God
065829	
065830	all
065831	
065832	and we are
065833	witnesses of it.
065834	
065835	to the right hand
065836	So then,
065837	
065838	of God,
065839	exalted
065840	
065841	
065842	the promise

065845	
065846	of the Holy
065847	and having received
065848	from
065849	
065850	the Father,
065851	he has poured out
065852	
065853	what
065854	
065855	
065856	you both see
065857	
065858	and hear.
065859	did not
065860	For
065861	David
065862	ascend
065863	into
065864	
065865	heaven,
065866	says,
065867	but he himself
065868	
065869	said
065870	
065871	‘The Lord

065888	
065889	beyond a doubt
065890	Therefore
065891	know
065892	let all
065893	the house

065897	both Lord

065900	and Christ.”
065901	has made
065902	
065903	that God
065904	
065905	
065906	this Jesus
065907	whom
065908	
065909	you crucified
065910	when they heard
065911	Now
065912	
065913	
065914	this, they were acutely distressed
065915	and said
065916	
065917	to
065918	
065919	Peter
065920	
065921	
065922	and the rest
065923	of the apostles,
065924	“What
065925	should we do,
065926	brothers?”
065927	
065928	Peter
065929	
065930	said to them,
065931	
065932	“Repent,
065933	
065934	
065935	of you be baptized
065936	and each one
065937	
065938	in
065939	
065940	the name
065941	of Jesus
065942	Christ
065943	for
065944	the forgiveness
065945	
065946	of your sins,
065947	
065948	
065949	and you will receive
065950	
065951	the gift
065952	
065953	of the Holy
065954	Spirit.
065955	
065956	For
065957	is for you
065958	
065959	the promise
065960	
065961	
065962	and your children,
065963	
065964	
065965	and for all
065966	
065967	
065968	who are far away,
065969	as many as
065970	
065971	will call to himself.”
065972	the Lord
065973	
065974	our God
065975	
065976	other
065977	
065978	words
065979	With many
065980	he testified
065981	
065982	and exhorted them
065983	
065984	saying,
065985	“Save
065986	yourselves from
065987	
065988	generation!”
065989	
065990	this perverse
065991	
065992	
065993	
065994	So
065995	those who accepted
065996	
065997	his message
065998	
065999	were baptized,
066000	
066001	were added.

066003	
066004	day
066005	and that
066006	people
066007	about
066008	three thousand
066009	They were
066010	
066011	devoting
066012	
066013	teaching
066014	
066015	themselves to the apostles’
066016	
066017	
066018	and to fellowship,
066019	
066020	to the breaking
066021	
066022	of bread
066023	
066024	
066025	and to prayer.
066026	came over
066027	
066028	
066029	everyone,

066031	and many
066032	
066033	wonders
066034	
066035	and miraculous signs
066036	by
066037	
066038	the apostles.
066039	came about
066040	All
066041	
066042	
066043	who believed
066044	were
066045	
066046	
066047	together
066048	
066049	and held
066050	everything
066051	in common,
066052	
066053	
066054	their property
066055	
066056	
066057	and possessions
066058	and they began selling
066059	
066060	and distributing
066061	
066062	the proceeds to everyone,
066063	as
066064	
066065	anyone
066066	need.
066067	had
066068	Every
066069	day
066070	
066071	they continued
066072	to gather together by common consent
066073	in
066074	
066075	the temple courts,
066076	breaking
066077	
066078	
066079	from house to house,
066080	bread
066081	sharing
066082	their food
066083	with
066084	glad
066085	
066086	and humble
066087	hearts,
066088	praising
066089	
066090	God
066091	
066092	and having
066093	the good will
066094	
066095	of all
066096	
066097	the people.
066098	
066099	And
066100	the Lord
066101	was adding
066102	
066103	those who were being saved.
066104	their number every
066105	day
066106	to
066107	
066108	
066109	Peter
066110	Now
066111	
066112	and John
066113	were going up
066114	to
066115	
066116	the temple
066117	at
066118	
066119	the time
066120	
066121	for prayer,
066122	
066123	at three o’clock in the afternoon.
066124	
066125	
066126	And a man
066127	lame
066128	from
066129	birth
066130	
066131	
066132	was being
066133	carried up,
066134	who
066135	was placed
066136	Gate” every
066137	day
066138	
066139	
066140	gate
066141	
066142	at the temple
066143	
066144	called
066145	“the Beautiful
066146	
066147	so he could beg for
066148	money
066149	from
066150	
066151	those going into
066152	
066153	
066154	the temple courts.
066155	When he
066156	saw
066157	Peter
066158	
066159	and John
066160	about
066161	to go into
066162	
066163	
066164	the temple courts,
066165	he asked
066166	them for money.
066167	
066168	looked directly
066169	
066170	Peter
066171	at him
066172	
066173	
066174	
066175	(as did John)
066176	and said,
066177	“Look at us!”
066178	
066179	
066180	
066181	So
066182	the lame man paid attention to them,
066183	
066184	expecting
066185	something
066186	from them.
066187	
066188	to receive
066189	said,
066190	But
066191	Peter
066192	silver
066193	
066194	or gold,
066195	no
066196	have
066197	“I
066198	what
066199	but
066200	I do have
066201	
066202	
066203	I give you.
066204	In
066205	
066206	the name
066207	of Jesus
066208	Christ
066209	
066210	the Nazarene,
066211	stand up
066212	
066213	and walk!”
066214	
066215	Then Peter took hold of him
066216	
066217	
066218	by the right
066219	hand
066220	and raised
066221	him up,
066222	at once
066223	and
066224	were made strong.
066225	
066226	the man’s feet
066227	
066228	
066229	
066230	and ankles
066231	
066232	He jumped up,
066233	stood
066234	
066235	and began walking around,
066236	
066237	and he entered
066238	with them,
066239	
066240	
066241	
066242	the temple courts
066243	walking
066244	
066245	and leaping
066246	
066247	and praising
066248	
066249	God.
066250	
066251	saw him
066252	All
066253	
066254	the people
066255	
066256	walking
066257	
066258	and praising
066259	
066260	God,
066261	they recognized him
066262	and
066263	
066264	
066265	
066266	as the man who used
066267	
066268	to
066269	
066270	and ask for donations
066271	sit
066272	at
066273	
066274	the Beautiful
066275	Gate
066276	
066277	of the temple,
066278	
066279	and they were filled
066280	with astonishment
066281	
066282	and amazement
066283	at
066284	
066285	what had happened to him.
066286	
066287	While the man was hanging on
066288	
066289	
066290	
066291	to Peter
066292	
066293	
066294	and John,
066295	ran together
066296	all
066297	
066298	the people,
066299	to them
066300	
066301	in
066302	
066303	Portico.
066304	
066305	the covered walkway called
066306	Solomon’s
066307	completely astounded,
066308	saw
066309	
066310	
066311	When Peter this,
066312	he declared
066313	to
066314	
066315	the people,
066316	“Men
066317	of Israel,
066318	why
066319	are you amazed
066320	at this?
066321	
066322	
066323	
066324	Why
066325	do you stare at us
066326	as
066327	by our own
066328	power
066329	or
066330	piety?
066331	if we had made
066332	
066333	this man walk
066334	
066335	
066336	The God
066337	of Abraham,
066338	
066339	
066340	the God
066341	Isaac,
066342	
066343	
066344	
066345	and Jacob,
066346	
066347	
066348	
066349	of our forefathers,
066350	
066351	has glorified
066352	
066353	his servant
066354	
066355	Jesus,
066356	whom
066357	
066358	
066359	you handed over
066360	
066361	and rejected
066362	in
066363	the presence
066364	of Pilate
066365	after he had decided
066366	him.
066367	to release
066368	
066369	But
066370	
066371	the Holy
066372	
066373	and Righteous One
066374	you rejected
066375	
066376	and asked
066377	that a man
066378	who was a murderer
066379	be released to you.
066380	
066381	
066382	
066383	the Originator
066384	
066385	of life,
066386	You killed
066387	whom
066388	
066389	God
066390	raised
066391	from
066392	the dead.
066393	To this fact
066394	
066395	witnesses!
066396	we are
066397	
066398	And on the basis
066399	
066400	of faith
066401	
066402	in Jesus’ name,
066403	
066404	
066405	has made this man – whom
066406	you see
066407	
066408	and know –
066409	strong.
066410	
066411	his very name
066412	
066413	
066414	
066415	The faith
066416	
066417	that is through
066418	
066419	Jesus has given him
066420	
066421	
066422	this complete health
066423	
066424	in the presence of you
066425	all.
066426	
066427	
066428	And now,
066429	brothers,
066430	I know
066431	
066432	in
066433	ignorance,
066434	you acted
066435	as
066436	
066437	
066438	your rulers did too.
066439	
066440	
066441	But
066442	God
066443	the things
066444	foretold long ago
066445	through
066446	
066447	all
066448	
066449	the prophets –
066450	would suffer –
066451	
066452	that his Christ
066453	
066454	he has fulfilled
066455	in this way.
066456	repent
066457	Therefore
066458	
066459	and turn back
066460	so that
066461	
066462	may be wiped out,
066463	
066464	
066465	your sins
066466	so that
066467	
066468	may come
066469	times
066470	of refreshing
066471	from
066472	the presence
066473	
066474	of the Lord,
066475	
066476	and so that he may send
066477	
066478	appointed for you –
066479	
066480	the Messiah
066481	that is, Jesus.
066482	This one
066483	must
066484	heaven
066485	
066486	receive
066487	until
066488	the time
066489	things are restored,
066490	all
066491	which
066492	declared
066493	
066494	God
066495	through
066496	
066497	
066498	his holy
066499	from
066500	times long ago
066501	
066502	prophets.
066503	Moses
066504	
066505	said,
066506	
066507	a prophet
066508	
066509	will raise up for you
066510	‘The Lord
066511	
066512	your God
066513	
066514	from among
066515	
066516	your brothers.
066517	
066518	like me
066519	
066520	
066521	You must obey him
066522	in
066523	everything
066524	
066525	
066526	he tells you.
066527	
066528	
066529	
066530	
066531	Every
066532	person
066533	who
066534	
066535	does not
066536	obey
066537	
066538	prophet
066539	that
066540	will be destroyed and thus removed
066541	from
066542	
066543	the people.’
066544	
066545	And all
066546	
066547	
066548	the prophets,
066549	from
066550	Samuel
066551	
066552	
066553	and those who followed
066554	
066555	him, have spoken
066556	
066557	about and announced
066558	
066559	these days.
066560	
066561	
066562	You are
066563	
066564	the sons
066565	
066566	of the prophets
066567	
066568	
066569	and of the covenant
066570	that
066571	made
066572	
066573	God
066574	with
066575	
066576	your ancestors,
066577	
066578	saying
066579	to
066580	Abraham,
066581	
066582	‘And in
066583	
066584	your descendants
066585	
066586	will be blessed.’
066587	all
066588	
066589	the nations
066590	
066591	of the earth
066592	
066593	first to you,
066594	raised up
066595	
066596	God
066597	
066598	his servant
066599	
066600	and sent him
066601	
066602	to bless you
066603	
066604	by
066605	
066606	turning
066607	each one
066608	of you from
066609	
066610	your iniquities.”
066611	
066612	While Peter and John were speaking
066613	
066614	
066615	to
066616	
066617	the people,
066618	came up to them,
066619	
066620	
066621	the priests
066622	
066623	
066624	and the commander
066625	
066626	of the temple
066627	
066628	
066629	guard and the Sadducees
066630	angry
066631	because
066632

066653	and put
066654	them in

066670	
066671	came

066714	Peter and John stand
066715	in
066716	
066717	their midst,
066718	they began to inquire,
066719	“By
066720	what
066721	power
066722	or
066723	by
066724	what
066725	name
066726	did you do this?”
066727	
066728	
066729	Then
066730	Peter,
066731	filled
066732	Spirit,
066733	with the Holy
066734	replied,
066735

066744	today
066745	we are being examined
066746	for
066747	a good deed

066749	done to a sick
066750	by
066751	what

066769	
066770	the Nazarene
066771	whom
066772	
066773	you crucified,
066774	whom
066775	
066776	God
066777	raised

066786	healthy.
066787	
066788	This Jesus is
066789	
066790	the stone
066791	
066792	that was rejected

066795	
066796	the builders,

066798	that has become
066799	
066800	
066801	the cornerstone.

066826	
066827	When they saw
066828	
066829	
066830	
066831	of Peter
066832	the boldness
066833	
066834	and John,
066835	and
066836	discovered
066837	
066838	men,
066839	uneducated
066840	that they were
066841	
066842	and ordinary
066843	amazed
066844	recognized
066845	and
066846	these men had been
066847	
066848	with
066849	
066850	Jesus.
066851	they were
066852	
066853	And
066854	the man
066855	because they saw
066856	with them,
066857	
066858	standing
066859	
066860	who had been healed
066861	nothing
066862	they had
066863	to say against this.
066864	when they had ordered them
066865	But
066866	
066867	outside

066870	to go
066871	they began to confer
066872	with
066873	one another,
066874	saying,
066875	“What
066876	should we do
066877	
066878	with these men?
066879	
066880	
066881	
066882	For
066883	that a notable
066884	miraculous sign
066885	has come about
066886	through them,
066887	
066888	to all
066889	
066890	who live
066891	in Jerusalem
066892	it is plain
066893	
066894	
066895	and we cannot
066896	deny it.
066897	But
066898	to
066899	keep this matter
066900	from
066901	any further
066902	spreading
066903	among
066904	
066905	the people,
066906	let us warn them
066907	
066908	
066909	to speak

066913	
066914	no more

066918	
066919	them in and ordered them

066921	at all
066922	not
066923	to speak

066931	
066932	But
066933	Peter

066935	and John

066971	how
066972	to punish them

066974	on account of

066996	this miraculous sign

066998	
066999	of healing
067000	When they were released,
067001	
067002	Peter and John went
067003	to
067004	
067005	their fellow believers
067006	
067007	and reported

067022	their voices
067023	to
067024	
067025	God
067026	
067027	and said,

067351	for yourself part of
067352	
067353	the proceeds
067354

067356	did it not
067357	Before it was sold,
067358	
067359	belong to you?
067360	
067361	And when it was sold,
067362	at
067363	
067364	your
067365	disposal?
067366	was the money not
067367	How
067368	
067369	have you thought up
067370	in
067371	
067372	your heart?
067373	
067374	
067375	this deed
067376	
067377	You have not
067378	lied
067379	to people
067380	but
067381	
067382	to God!”
067383	heard
067384	
067385	
067386	When Ananias
067387	
067388	these words
067389	
067390	he collapsed
067391	and died,

067397	all
067398	
067399	who heard about it.
067400	came,
067401	So
067402	
067403	the young men
067404	wrapped
067405	him up,

067423	came in,
067424	said
067425	
067426	to her,
067427	
067428	Peter
067429	“Tell me,
067430	
067431	
067432	this amount
067433	
067434	for the land?”
067435	were the two of you paid
067436	
067437	
067438	Sapphira said,
067439	“Yes,
067440	that much.”
067441	
067442	then told her,
067443	Peter
067444	
067445	
067446	“Why
067447	
067448	have you agreed together
067449	
067450	to test
067451	
067452	the Spirit
067453	of the Lord?
067454	Look!
067455	
067456	The feet

067458	of those who have buried
067459	
067460	your husband

067462	are at
067463	
067464	the door,
067465	
067466	and they will carry
067467	you out!”
067468	she collapsed
067469	
067470	At once
067471	at
067472	
067473	his feet
067474	
067475	
067476	and died.
067477	came in,
067478	So
067479	
067480	when the young men
067481	they found her
067482	
067483	dead,
067484	
067485	and they carried her out
067486	and buried
067487	her beside
067488	
067489	her husband.

067505	through
067506	Now
067507	
067508	the hands
067509	
067510	of the apostles.
067511	came about
067512	miraculous signs
067513	
067514	and wonders
067515	many
067516	among
067517	
067518	the people

067520	they were
067521	By common consent
067522	all
067523	meeting together in
067524	
067525	Portico.
067526	Solomon’s
067527	
067528	
067529	of the rest
067530	None
067531	dared
067532	to join them,

067534	but
067535	in high honor.
067536	held them

067546	men
067547	of both

067550	Thus
067551	
067552	into
067553	
067554	the streets,
067555	they even carried
067556	
067557	the sick out
067558	
067559	and put
067560	them on
067561	cots
067562	
067563	and pallets,
067564	so that
067565	came by
067566	when Peter
067567	at least
067568	
067569	his shadow
067570	would fall on
067571	some of them.
067572	
067573	also came together,
067574

067577	A crowd
067578	
067579	around

067599	those with him

067601	
067602	(that is,
067603	the religious party
067604	
067605	of the Sadducees),
067606	and they were filled
067607	with jealousy.
067608	
067609	They laid
067610	
067611	hands
067612	on
067613	
067614	the apostles
067615	
067616	and put them
067617	
067618	in
067619	jail.
067620	a public
067621	an angel
067622	But
067623	of the Lord
067624	during
067625	the night
067626	opened
067627	
067628	the doors
067629	
067630	of the prison,
067631	led
067632	and
067633	them out,
067634	said,
067635	“Go
067636	
067637	and stand
067638	and proclaim
067639	in
067640	
067641	the temple courts
067642	
067643	to the people
067644	all
067645	
067646	the words
067647	
067648	of this life.”
067649	
067650	When they heard
067651	
067652	this, they entered
067653	
067654	
067655	at daybreak
067656	to
067657	
067658	the temple courts
067659	
067660	and began teaching.
067661	arrived,
067662	Now
067663	
067664	when the high priest
067665	
067666	
067667	and those who were with him
067668	
067669	they summoned
067670	
067671	the Sanhedrin –
067672	
067673	that is, the whole
067674	
067675	high council
067676	
067677	
067678	of the Israelites –
067679	
067680	and sent
067681	
067682	
067683	the jail
067684	to have the apostles brought before them.
067685	
067686	
067687	But
067688	who came for them
067689	the officers
067690	did not
067691	find them
067692	
067693	in
067694	
067695	the prison,
067696	they returned
067697	so
067698	and
067699	reported,
067700	
067701	
067702	the jail
067703	“We found
067704	locked
067705	
067706	
067707	securely
067708	
067709	
067710	and the guards
067711	standing
067712	at
067713	
067714	the doors,
067715	when we opened
067716	but
067717	inside.”
067718	no one
067719	them, we found
067720	when
067721	Now
067722	heard
067723	
067724	this report,
067725	
067726	
067727	
067728	the commander
067729	
067730	of the temple guard
067731	
067732	
067733	and the chief priests
067734	they were greatly puzzled
067735	concerning it,
067736	
067737	wondering what
067738	
067739	this could be.
067740	
067741	came
067742	But
067743	someone
067744	and reported to them,
067745	
067746	
067747	“Look!
067748	
067749	The men
067750	
067751	you put
067752	in
067753	
067754	prison
067755	are
067756	in
067757	
067758	the temple courts
067759	standing
067760	
067761	and teaching
067762	
067763	the people!”
067764	Then
067765	went
067766	
067767	the commander of the temple guard
067768	with
067769	
067770	the officers
067771	and brought
067772	
067773	the apostles without
067774	the use
067775	of force
067776	they were afraid
067777	(for
067778	
067779	
067780	by the people).
067781	of being stoned
067782	When they had brought them,
067783	
067784	
067785	they stood
067786	them before
067787	
067788	the council,
067789	
067790	questioned them,
067791	
067792	
067793	and the high priest
067794	saying,
067795	
067796	strict orders
067797	“We gave you
067798	
067799	not
067800	to teach
067801	in
067802	
067803	this name.
067804	
067805	
067806	Look,
067807	you have filled
067808	
067809	Jerusalem
067810	
067811	with your teaching,
067812	
067813	
067814	and you intend
067815	to bring
067816	on us!”
067817	
067818	
067819	blood
067820	
067821	this man’s
067822	
067823	replied,
067824	But
067825	Peter
067826	
067827	
067828	and the apostles
067829	
067830	obey
067831	“We must
067832	God
067833	rather
067834	than
067835	people.
067836	
067837	The God
067838	
067839	of our forefathers
067840	
067841	raised up
067842	Jesus,
067843	whom
067844	
067845	you seized and killed
067846	by hanging
067847	him on
067848	a tree.
067849	
067850	
067851	God
067852	as Leader
067853	
067854	and Savior,
067855	exalted
067856	
067857	him to his right hand
067858	
067859	
067860	to give
067861	repentance
067862	
067863	to Israel
067864	
067865	and forgiveness
067866	of sins.
067867	
067868	
067869	And we are
067870	witnesses
067871	
067872	of these events,
067873	
067874	
067875	
067876	Spirit
067877	
067878	and so is the Holy
067879	whom
067880	has given
067881	
067882	God
067883	
067884	to those who obey him.”
067885	
067886	
067887	Now
067888	when they heard
067889	this, they became furious
067890	
067891	and wanted
067892	to execute them.
067893	
067894	stood up
067895	But
067896	
067897	in
067898	
067899	the council
067900	a Pharisee
067901	whose name
067902	was Gamaliel,
067903	a teacher of the law
067904	who was respected
067905	by all
067906	
067907	the people,
067908	and ordered
067909	outside
067910	for a short time.
067911	
067912	the men
067913	to be put
067914	he said
067915	Then
067916	to
067917	
067918	the council, “Men
067919	of Israel,
067920	pay close attention
067921	
067922	to
067923	
067924	these men.
067925	
067926	to what
067927	you are about
067928	to do
067929	ago
067930	For
067931	
067932	
067933	some time
067934	rose up,
067935	Theudas
067936	claiming
067937	to be
067938	somebody,
067939	
067940	him.
067941	joined
067942	men
067943	
067944	and about
067945	four hundred
067946	He
067947	was killed,
067948	
067949	and all
067950	
067951	who followed him
067952	
067953	were dispersed
067954	
067955	came of it.
067956	
067957	and nothing
067958	After
067959	
067960	arose
067961	him Judas
067962	
067963	the Galilean
067964	in
067965	
067966	the days
067967	
067968	of the census,
067969	
067970	and incited
067971	people
067972	to follow him
067973	
067974	in revolt. He too
067975	was killed,
067976	
067977	and all
067978	
067979	who followed him
067980	
067981	were scattered.
067982	
067983	
067984	So in this case
067985	I say to you,
067986	
067987	stay away
067988	from
067989	
067990	these men
067991	
067992	
067993	and leave
067994	them alone,
067995	
067996	because if
067997	
067998	originates with
067999	people,
068000	
068001	this plan
068002	
068003	or
068004	
068005	this undertaking
068006	
068007	it will come to nothing,
068008	if
068009	but
068010	from
068011	God,
068012	it is
068013	you will not
068014	be able
068015	to stop them,
068016	
068017	or
068018	
068019	fighting against God.”
068020	you may even be found
068021	He convinced them,
068022	
068023	
068024	
068025	and they summoned
068026	
068027	the apostles
068028	and had them beaten.
068029	Then they ordered
068030	them not
068031	to speak
068032	in
068033	
068034	the name
068035	
068036	of Jesus
068037	
068038	and released them.
068039	
068040	
068041	So
068042	they left
068043	rejoicing
068044	
068045	
068046	
068047	the council
068048	
068049	because they had been considered worthy
068050	for the sake
068051	
068052	of the name.
068053	to suffer dishonor

068059	temple courts
068060	
068061	and from
068062	house to house,
068063	they did not
068064	stop
068065	teaching
068066	
068067	and proclaiming the good news
068068	
068069	was the Christ.
068070	that Jesus

068072	Now
068073	
068074	those days,
068075	
068076	were growing in number,
068077	
068078	when the disciples
068079	arose
068080	a complaint
068081	
068082	on the part of the Greek-speaking Jews
068083	against
068084	
068085	the native Hebraic Jews,
068086	
068087	were being overlooked
068088	in
068089	
068090	distribution of food.
068091	
068092	the daily
068093	
068094	because their widows
068095	
068096	called

068099	the twelve
068100	
068101	the whole group
068102	
068103	of the disciples
068104	together and said,
068105	not
068106	right for us
068107	“It is
068108	
068109	to neglect
068110	
068111	the word
068112	
068113	of God
068114	to wait
068115	on tables.
068116	carefully select
068117	But
068118	brothers,
068119	men
068120	from among you,
068121	
068122	who are well-attested,
068123	seven
068124	full
068125	of the Spirit
068126	
068127	and of wisdom,
068128	whom
068129	we may put in charge
068130	of
068131	
068132	this necessary task.

068134	
068135	But
068136	
068137	ourselves to prayer
068138	
068139	
068140	and to the ministry
068141	
068142	of the word.”
068143	we will devote

068145	pleased
068146	
068147	The proposal
068148	
068149	the entire
068150	
068151	group,
068152	
068153	so they chose
068154	Stephen,
068155	a man
068156	full
068157	of faith
068158	
068159	Spirit,
068160	and of the Holy
068161	
068162	with Philip,
068163	
068164	Prochorus,
068165	
068166	Nicanor,
068167	
068168	Timon,
068169	
068170	Parmenas,
068171	
068172	and Nicolas,
068173	a Gentile convert to Judaism
068174	from Antioch.
068175	They
068176	stood
068177	these men before
068178	
068179	the apostles,
068180	
068181	who prayed
068182	and placed
068183	hands
068184	
068185	their on them.
068186	
068187	
068188	The word
068189	
068190	of God
068191	continued to spread,
068192	
068193	increased
068194	
068195	the number
068196	
068197	of disciples
068198	in
068199	Jerusalem
068200	greatly,
068201	a large
068202	and
068203	group
068204	
068205	of priests
068206	became obedient
068207	
068208	to the faith.
068209	Stephen,
068210	Now
068211	full
068212	of grace
068213	
068214	and power,
068215	was performing
068216	wonders
068217	
068218	and miraculous signs
068219	great
068220	among
068221	
068222	the people.
068223	stood up
068224	But
068225	some men
068226	
068227	from
068228	
068229	the Synagogue
068230	
068231	(as it was called),
068232	of the Freedmen
068233	
068234	both Cyrenians
068235	
068236	and Alexandrians,
068237	
068238	
068239	as well as some from
068240	Cilicia
068241	
068242	and the province of Asia,
068243	and argued
068244	
068245	with Stephen.
068246	
068247	Yet they were not
068248	able
068249	to resist
068250	
068251	the wisdom
068252	
068253	
068254	and the Spirit
068255	with which
068256	he spoke.
068257	Then
068258	they secretly instigated
068259	some men
068260	to say,
068261	
068262	“We have heard
068263	
068264	this man speaking
068265	words
068266	blasphemous
068267	against
068268	Moses
068269	
068270	
068271	and God.”
068272	They incited
068273	
068274	
068275	the people,
068276	
068277	
068278	the elders,
068279	
068280	
068281	and the experts in the law;
068282	
068283	then they approached
068284	Stephen, seized him,
068285	
068286	
068287	and brought
068288	him before
068289	
068290	the council.
068291	They brought forward
068292	
068293	witnesses
068294	false
068295	who said,
068296	
068297	“This man
068298	
068299	does not
068300	stop
068301	saying
068302	things
068303	against
068304	
068305	place
068306	
068307	this holy
068308	
068309	
068310	
068311	and the law.
068312	we have heard him
068313	For
068314	
068315	saying
068316	that
068317	Jesus
068318	
068319	the Nazarene
068320	
068321	will destroy
068322	
068323	this place
068324	
068325	
068326	and change
068327	
068328	the customs
068329	that
068330	handed down to us.”
068331	
068332	Moses
068333	
068334	looked intently
068335	at
068336	
068337	All
068338	
068339	who were sitting
068340	in
068341	
068342	the council
068343	Stephen and saw
068344	
068345	his face
068346	
068347	was like
068348	the face
068349	of an angel.
068350	said,
068351	Then
068352	
068353	the high priest
068354	
068355	
068356	“Are these things true?”
068357	
068358	
068359	So
068360	he replied,
068361	
068362	“Brothers
068363	
068364	and fathers,
068365	listen to me.
068366	
068367	The God
068368	
068369	of glory
068370	appeared
068371	
068372	to our forefather
068373	
068374	Abraham
068375	when he was
068376	in
068377	
068378	Mesopotamia,
068379	before
068380	
068381	he settled
068382	
068383	in
068384	Haran,
068385	
068386	and said
068387	to him,
068388	
068389	‘Go out
068390	from
068391	
068392	your country
068393	
068394	
068395	and from
068396	
068397	your relatives,
068398	
068399	
068400	and come
068401	to
068402	
068403	the land
068404	
068405	
068406	
068407	I will show you.’
068408	Then
068409	he went out
068410	from
068411	the country
068412	of the Chaldeans
068413	and settled
068414	in
068415	Haran.
068416	
068417	After
068418	
068419	died, God made him
068420	
068421	his father
068422	
068423	move
068424	
068425	to
068426	
068427	this country
068428	
068429	
068430	where you
068431	
068432	now
068433	live.
068434	
068435	He did not
068436	give any of it to him
068437	
068438	for an inheritance,
068439	
068440	
068441	not even
068442	
068443	a foot of ground,
068444	
068445	yet God promised
068446	to give it to him
068447	
068448	as
068449	his possession,
068450	
068451	
068452	
068453	and to his descendants
068454	
068455	after him,
068456	
068457	no
068458	as yet had
068459	even though Abraham
068460	child.
068461	spoke
068462	But
068463	as follows:
068464	
068465	God
068466	
068467	will be
068468	
068469	‘Your descendants
068470	
068471	foreigners
068472	in
068473	country,
068474	a foreign
068475	
068476	whose citizens will enslave them
068477	
068478	
068479	and mistreat them
068480	years.
068481	for four hundred
068482	
068483	
068484	the nation
068485	
068486	
068487	they serve as slaves,’
068488	But I will punish
068489	
068490	
068491	God,
068492	said
068493	
068494	‘and after
068495	
068496	these things they will come out
068497	
068498	of there and worship me
068499	
068500	in
068501	
068502	this place.’
068503	
068504	
068505	Then God gave
068506	
068507	Abraham the covenant
068508	of circumcision,
068509	
068510	and so
068511	he became the father
068512	
068513	of Isaac
068514	
068515	and circumcised him
068516	
068517	
068518	days old,
068519	
068520	when he was eight
068521	
068522	and Isaac
068523	
068524	became the father of Jacob,
068525	
068526	and Jacob
068527	
068528	of the twelve
068529	patriarchs.
068530	
068531	
068532	The patriarchs,
068533	because they were jealous
068534	
068535	of Joseph,
068536	sold
068537	him into
068538	Egypt.
068539	
068540	was
068541	
068542	But God
068543	with him,
068544	
068545	
068546	and rescued him
068547	
068548	from
068549	all
068550	
068551	his troubles,
068552	
068553	
068554	and granted him
068555	
068556	favor
068557	
068558	and wisdom
068559	in the presence of
068560	Pharaoh,
068561	king
068562	of Egypt,
068563	
068564	who made him
068565	
068566	ruler
068567	over
068568	Egypt
068569	
068570	and over
068571	all
068572	
068573	his household.
068574	
068575	occurred
068576	Then
068577	a famine
068578	
068579	throughout
068580	
068581	Egypt
068582	
068583	and Canaan,
068584	
068585	suffering,
068586	causing great
068587	
068588	could not
068589	find
068590	food.
068591	
068592	and our ancestors
068593	
068594	heard
068595	So
068596	when Jacob
068597	that there was
068598	grain
068599	in
068600	Egypt,
068601	he sent
068602	
068603	our ancestors
068604	
068605	there the first time.
068606	
068607	On
068608	
068609	their second
068610	made himself known
068611	visit Joseph
068612	
068613	to his brothers again,
068614	
068615	
068616	known
068617	became
068618	
068619	to Pharaoh.
068620	
068621	family
068622	
068623	and Joseph’s
068624	sent
068625	So
068626	Joseph
068627	a message and invited
068628	Jacob
068629	
068630	his father
068631	
068632	
068633	and all
068634	
068635	his relatives
068636	in all.
068637	people
068638	to come, seventy-
068639	five
068640	
068641	went down
068642	So Jacob
068643	to
068644	Egypt
068645	
068646	and died
068647	
068648	
068649	
068650	there, along with our ancestors,
068651	
068652	
068653	and their bones were later moved
068654	to
068655	Shechem
068656	
068657	and placed
068658	in
068659	
068660	the tomb
068661	that
068662	had bought
068663	Abraham
068664	for a certain sum
068665	of money
068666	from
068667	
068668	the sons
068669	of Hamor
068670	in
068671	Shechem.
068672	as
068673	“But
068674	drew near
068675	
068676	the time
068677	
068678	to fulfill the promise
068679	
068680	he had declared
068681	
068682	for God
068683	
068684	to Abraham,
068685	increased
068686	
068687	the people
068688	
068689	greatly in number
068690	in
068691	Egypt,
068692	until
068693	who
068694	ruled
068695	king
068696	another
068697	over
068698	Egypt.
068699	
068700	did not
068701	know
068702	
068703	about Joseph
068704	
068705	This was the one who exploited
068706	
068707	our people
068708	
068709	and was cruel
068710	
068711	to our ancestors,
068712	
068713	
068714	forcing
068715	
068716	their infants
068717	them to abandon
068718	
068719	so
068720	
068721	
068722	they would die.
068723	At
068724	that
068725	time
068726	was born,
068727	Moses
068728	
068729	and he was
068730	beautiful
068731	
068732	to God.
068733	he
068734	was brought up
068735	months
068736	For three
068737	in
068738	
068739	house,
068740	
068741	his father’s
068742	when he had been abandoned,
068743	and
068744	
068745	adopted him
068746	
068747	
068748	daughter
068749	Pharaoh’s
068750	
068751	and brought
068752	him up
068753	her own
068754	as
068755	son.
068756	
068757	was trained
068758	So Moses
068759	in
068760	all
068761	the wisdom
068762	of the Egyptians
068763	was
068764	and
068765	powerful
068766	in
068767	his words
068768	
068769	and deeds.
068770	
068771	when
068772	But
068773	he was about
068774	
068775	forty
068776	years old,
068777	it entered
068778	
068779	
068780	his mind
068781	
068782	to visit
068783	
068784	his fellow countrymen
068785	
068786	
068787	
068788	the Israelites.
068789	
068790	When he saw
068791	one of them
068792	being hurt unfairly,
068793	Moses came to his defense
068794	
068795	
068796	and avenged
068797	
068798	the person who was mistreated
068799	by striking down
068800	
068801	the Egyptian.
068802	He thought
068803	
068804	would understand
068805	
068806	his own people
068807	him,
068808	
068809	
068810	that God
068811	through
068812	
068813	
068814	
068815	was delivering them
068816	
068817	
068818	but
068819	they did not
068820	understand.
068821	
068822	
068823	The next
068824	day
068825	Moses saw
068826	
068827	two men fighting,
068828	
068829	and tried to make
068830	
068831	
068832	peace between them,
068833	saying,
068834	‘Men,
068835	brothers;
068836	you are
068837	why
068838	are you hurting
068839	one another?’
068840	
068841	But
068842	the man who was unfairly hurting
068843	
068844	his neighbor
068845	pushed
068846	Moses aside,
068847	saying,
068848	‘Who
068849	
068850	made you
068851	a ruler
068852	
068853	and judge
068854	over us?
068855	
068856	You don’t
068857	to kill me
068858	
068859	
068860	want
068861	
068862	the way
068863	you killed
068864	yesterday, do you?’
068865	
068866	the Egyptian
068867	fled
068868	
068869	Moses
068870	in
068871	
068872	When the man said this,
068873	
068874	
068875	and became
068876	a foreigner
068877	
068878	the land
068879	of Midian,
068880	where
068881	he became the father
068882	sons.
068883	of two
068884	
068885	had passed,
068886	years
068887	“After forty
068888	appeared to him
068889	
068890	in
068891	
068892	the desert
068893	
068894	of Mount
068895	Sinai,
068896	an angel
068897	in
068898	the flame
068899	of a burning
068900	bush.
068901	
068902	
068903	When Moses
068904	saw
068905	it, he was amazed
068906	
068907	at the sight,
068908	when he approached
068909	and
068910	
068911	to investigate,
068912	there came
068913	the voice
068914	of the Lord,
068915	
068916	
068917	‘I am the God
068918	
068919	of your forefathers,
068920	
068921	
068922	the God
068923	of Abraham,
068924	
068925	Isaac,
068926	
068927	and Jacob.’
068928	tremble
068929	
068930	began to
068931	Moses
068932	and did not
068933	dare
068934	to look more closely.
068935	said to him,
068936	But
068937	
068938	
068939	the Lord
068940	‘Take
068941	
068942	the sandals off
068943	
068944	your feet,
068945	
068946	
068947	for
068948	the place
068949	
068950	where
068951	you are standing
068952	ground.
068953	holy
068954	is
068955	I have certainly
068956	seen
068957	
068958	the suffering
068959	
068960	of my people
068961	
068962	
068963	who are in
068964	Egypt
068965	
068966	
068967	their groaning,
068968	
068969	and have heard
068970	
068971	and I have come down
068972	to rescue them.
068973	
068974	
068975	Now
068976	come,
068977	I will send you
068978	
068979	to
068980	Egypt.’
068981	
068982	
068983	This same Moses
068984	
068985	they had rejected,
068986	saying,
068987	‘Who
068988	
068989	made you
068990	a ruler
068991	
068992	and judge?’
068993	
068994	
068995	God
068996	
068997	as both ruler
068998	
068999	and deliverer
069000	sent
069001	through
069002	the hand
069003	of the angel
069004	
069005	who appeared to him
069006	
069007	in
069008	
069009	the bush.
069010	
069011	This man led
069012	them out,
069013	performing
069014	wonders
069015	
069016	and miraculous signs
069017	in
069018	the land
069019	of Egypt,
069020	
069021	at
069022	the Red
069023	Sea,
069024	
069025	and in
069026	
069027	the wilderness
069028	years.
069029	for forty
069030	
069031	This is
069032	
069033	the Moses
069034	
069035	who said
069036	
069037	
069038	to the Israelites,
069039	a prophet
069040	
069041	will raise up for you
069042	
069043	‘God
069044	from
069045	
069046	among your brothers.’
069047	
069048	like me
069049	
069050	
069051	This is
069052	
069053	the man who was
069054	in
069055	
069056	the congregation
069057	in
069058	
069059	the wilderness
069060	with
069061	
069062	the angel
069063	
069064	who spoke to him
069065	
069066	at
069067	
069068	Mount
069069	Sinai,
069070	
069071	
069072	and with our ancestors,
069073	
069074	and he
069075	received
069076	oracles
069077	living
069078	to give to you.
069079	
069080	
069081	
069082	were unwilling
069083	
069084	to obey him,
069085	
069086	Our ancestors
069087	
069088	but
069089	pushed him aside
069090	
069091	and turned back
069092	in
069093	
069094	their hearts,
069095	
069096	to
069097	Egypt
069098	saying
069099	
069100	to Aaron,
069101	‘Make us
069102	
069103	gods
069104	who
069105	will go in front of us,
069106	
069107	
069108	for
069109	this Moses,
069110	
069111	who
069112	led
069113	us out
069114	of
069115	the land
069116	of Egypt –
069117	we do not
069118	know
069119	what
069120	has happened to him!’
069121	
069122	
069123	they made an idol in the form of a calf,
069124	At
069125	
069126	time
069127	that
069128	
069129	brought
069130	a sacrifice
069131	
069132	to the idol,
069133	
069134	and began rejoicing
069135	in
069136	
069137	the works
069138	
069139	of their hands.
069140	
069141	turned away
069142	But
069143	
069144	God
069145	
069146	from them and gave
069147	them over
069148	to worship
069149	
069150	the host
069151	
069152	of heaven,
069153	as
069154	it is written
069155	in
069156	the book
069157	
069158	of the prophets:
069159	‘It was not to me
069160	slain animals
069161	
069162	and sacrifices
069163	that you offered
069164	
069165	years
069166	forty
069167	in
069168	
069169	the wilderness,
069170	was it, house
069171	of Israel?
069172	
069173	But you took along
069174	
069175	the tabernacle
069176	
069177	of Moloch
069178	
069179	
069180	and the star
069181	
069182	of the god
069183	
069184	Rephan,
069185	
069186	the images
069187	
069188	you made
069189	to worship,
069190	
069191	
069192	but I will deport you
069193	
069194	beyond
069195	Babylon.’
069196	
069197	the tabernacle
069198	
069199	of testimony
069200	had
069201	
069202	Our ancestors
069203	
069204	in
069205	
069206	the wilderness,
069207	just as
069208	ordered
069209	
069210	God who spoke
069211	
069212	to Moses
069213	him to make it
069214	
069215	according to
069216	
069217	the design
069218	
069219	he had seen.
069220	
069221	
069222	of it and brought
069223	received possession it in
069224	
069225	Our ancestors
069226	
069227	with
069228	Joshua
069229	when
069230	
069231	they dispossessed
069232	
069233	the nations
069234	that
069235	drove out
069236	
069237	God
069238	
069239	before
069240	
069241	our ancestors,
069242	
069243	until
069244	
069245	the time
069246	of David.
069247	He
069248	found
069249	favor
069250	with
069251	
069252	God
069253	
069254	and asked
069255	that he could find
069256	a dwelling place
069257	
069258	for the house
069259	of Jacob.
069260	Solomon
069261	But
069262	built
069263	
069264	a house for him.
069265	Yet
069266	does not
069267	
069268	the Most High
069269	in
069270	houses made by human hands,
069271	live
069272	as
069273	
069274	the prophet
069275	says,
069276	
069277	‘Heaven
069278	
069279	is my throne,
069280	
069281	
069282	and earth
069283	is the footstool
069284	
069285	for my feet.
069286	
069287	What kind
069288	of house
069289	will you build for me,
069290	
069291	says
069292	the Lord,
069293	or
069294	what
069295	place?
069296	
069297	is my resting
069298	
069299	not
069300	
069301	Did my hand
069302	
069303	make
069304	
069305	all these things?’
069306	“You stubborn
069307	
069308	people, with uncircumcised
069309	hearts
069310	
069311	
069312	and ears!
069313	
069314	You are always
069315	
069316	Spirit,
069317	
069318	the Holy
069319	resisting
069320	like
069321	
069322	your ancestors did!
069323	
069324	
069325	
069326	Which
069327	
069328	of the prophets
069329	not
069330	persecute?
069331	
069332	did your ancestors
069333	
069334	
069335	They killed
069336	
069337	those who foretold long ago
069338	
069339	
069340	the coming
069341	
069342	of the Righteous One,
069343	whose
069344	have now
069345	
069346	betrayers
069347	
069348	and murderers you
069349	become!
069350	You
069351	received
069352	
069353	the law
069354	by
069355	decrees given
069356	by angels,
069357	
069358	but you did not
069359	obey it.”
069360	When they heard
069361	
069362	
069363	
069364	
069365	these things, they became furious
069366	
069367	
069368	and ground
069369	
069370	their teeth
069371	at him.
069372	
069373	
069374	But
069375	Stephen, full
069376	Spirit,
069377	of the Holy
069378	looked intently
069379	toward
069380	
069381	heaven
069382	and saw
069383	the glory
069384	of God,
069385	
069386	and Jesus
069387	standing
069388	at
069389	the right hand
069390	
069391	of God.
069392	
069393	he said.
069394	“Look!”
069395	“I see
069396	
069397	the heavens
069398	opened,
069399	
069400	
069401	and the Son
069402	
069403	of Man
069404	at
069405	the right hand
069406	standing
069407	
069408	of God!”
069409	shouting out
069410	But
069411	voice,
069412	with a loud
069413	they covered
069414	
069415	their ears,
069416	
069417	
069418	and rushed
069419	with one intent.
069420	at him
069421	
069422	
069423	When they had driven
069424	him out of
069425	
069426	the city,
069427	they began to stone him,
069428	
069429	
069430	and the witnesses
069431	laid
069432	
069433	their cloaks
069434	
069435	at
069436	
069437	the feet
069438	of a young man
069439	named
069440	Saul.
069441	
069442	They continued to stone
069443	
069444	Stephen
069445	while he prayed,
069446	
069447	
069448	“Lord
069449	Jesus,
069450	receive
069451	
069452	my spirit!”
069453	
069454	he fell
069455	Then
069456	
069457	to his knees
069458	and cried out
069459	voice,
069460	with a loud
069461	“Lord,
069462	do not
069463	hold
069464	
069465	
069466	
069467	this sin against them!”
069468	
069469	
069470	When he had said
069471	this, he died.
069472	Saul
069473	And
069474	
069475	agreed completely
069476	
069477	with killing him.
069478	
069479	
069480	Now
069481	on
069482	that
069483	
069484	day
069485	persecution
069486	a great
069487	began against
069488	
069489	the church
069490	
069491	in
069492	Jerusalem,
069493	all
069494	and
069495	were forced to scatter
069496	throughout
069497	
069498	the regions
069499	
069500	of Judea
069501	
069502	and Samaria.
069503	except
069504	
069505	the apostles

069509	Stephen
069510	men
069511	Some devout
069512	
069513	and made
069514	lamentation
069515	loud
069516	over him.
069517	
069518	Saul
069519	But
069520	was trying to destroy
069521	
069522	the church;
069523	one house
069524	
069525	after another,
069526	entering
069527	he dragged off
069528	both
069529	men
069530	
069531	and women
069532	and put
069533	them in
069534	prison.
069535	
069536	
069537	Now
069538	those who had been forced to scatter
069539	went around
069540	proclaiming the good news
069541	
069542	of the word.
069543	Philip
069544	
069545	went down
069546	to
069547	
069548	the main city
069549	
069550	of Samaria
069551	and began proclaiming

069563	what Philip

069565	
069566	
069567	as they heard
069568	
069569	
069570	and saw
069571	
069572	the miraculous signs
069573	
069574	he was performing.
069575	of many
069576	For
069577	
069578	who were possessed,
069579	spirits,
069580	unclean
069581	crying
069582	shrieks,
069583	with loud

069585	and many
069586	
069587	paralyzed
069588	
069589	and lame people
069590	were healed.
069591	there was
069592	So
069593	great
069594	joy
069595	in
069596	
069597	city.
069598	that
069599	was a man
069600	Now
069601	someone
069602	named
069603	Simon,
069604	who had been practicing

069606	
069607	that city
069608	magic
069609	
069610	and amazing
069611	
069612	the people
069613	
069614	of Samaria,
069615	claiming
069616	to be
069617	
069618	
069619	great.
069620	
069621	paid close attention
069622	All
069623	the people, from
069624	the least
069625	to
069626	the greatest,
069627	to him, saying,
069628	
069629	“This man is
069630	
069631	the power
069632	
069633	of God
069634	
069635	that is called
069636	‘Great.’”
069637	they paid close attention to him
069638	And
069639	
069640	because
069641	
069642	for a long
069643	time
069644	
069645	with his magic.
069646	he had amazed them
069647	
069648	when
069649	But
069650	they believed
069651	
069652	Philip
069653	as he was proclaiming the good news
069654	about
069655	
069656	the kingdom
069657	
069658	of God
069659	
069660	
069661	and the name
069662	of Jesus
069663	Christ,
069664	they began to be baptized,
069665	men
069666	both
069667	
069668	and women.
069669	
069670	Even
069671	Simon himself
069672	
069673	
069674	believed,
069675	
069676	baptized,
069677	and after he was
069678	he stayed close
069679	
069680	to Philip
069681	constantly,
069682	and
069683	when he saw the signs
069684	
069685	miracles
069686	and great
069687	that were occurring,
069688	he was amazed.
069689	heard
069690	Now
069691	
069692	in
069693	Jerusalem
069694	when the apostles
069695	
069696	had accepted
069697	
069698	that Samaria
069699	
069700	the word
069701	
069702	of God,
069703	they sent
069704	to them.
069705	
069706	Peter
069707	
069708	and John
069709	These
069710	two went down
069711	and prayed
069712	for them
069713	
069714	so that
069715	they would receive
069716	Spirit.
069717	the Holy
069718	the Spirit had not yet
069719	(For
069720	
069721	
069722	any of them,
069723	
069724	come upon
069725	they had only
069726	but
069727	baptized
069728	been
069729	in
069730	
069731	the name
069732	
069733	of the Lord
069734	Jesus.)
069735	Then
069736	Peter and John placed
069737	
069738	their hands
069739	on
069740	
069741	
069742	the Samaritans, and they received
069743	Spirit.
069744	the Holy
069745	when he saw
069746	Now
069747	
069748	Simon,
069749	
069750	through
069751	
069752	the laying
069753	
069754	hands,
069755	
069756	on of the apostles’
069757	was given
069758	
069759	that the Spirit
069760	offered them
069761	
069762	money,
069763	saying,
069764	“Give
069765	me
069766	
069767	this power too,
069768	
069769	so that
069770	everyone
069771	
069772	I place
069773	
069774	my hands
069775	on may receive
069776	Spirit.”
069777	the Holy
069778	Peter
069779	But
069780	said
069781	to him,
069782	
069783	
069784	“May your silver
069785	
069786	with you,
069787	
069788	
069789	
069790	perish
069791	
069792	
069793	gift
069794	
069795	God’s
069796	because you thought
069797	with
069798	money!
069799	you could acquire
069800	You have no
069801	is
069802	
069803	share
069804	or
069805	part
069806	in
069807	
069808	this matter
069809	
069810	
069811	because
069812	your heart
069813	
069814	not
069815	
069816	right
069817	before
069818	
069819	God!
069820	repent
069821	Therefore
069822	of
069823	
069824	this wickedness
069825	
069826	
069827	
069828	of yours, and pray
069829	
069830	to the Lord
069831	
069832	that he may perhaps
069833	forgive you
069834	
069835	
069836	for the intent
069837	
069838	of your heart.
069839	
069840	
069841	For
069842	bitterly
069843	envious
069844	
069845	and in bondage
069846	to sin.”
069847	I see
069848	
069849	that you are
069850	replied,
069851	But
069852	
069853	Simon
069854	“You pray
069855	
069856	
069857	for me
069858	
069859	
069860	
069861	to the Lord
069862	so that
069863	nothing
069864	may happen
069865	to me.”
069866	
069867	of what
069868	you have said
069869	
069870	
069871	So
069872	after Peter and John had solemnly testified
069873	
069874	and spoken
069875	
069876	the word
069877	
069878	of the Lord,
069879	they started back
069880	to
069881	Jerusalem,
069882	to many
069883	
069884	villages as they went.
069885	
069886	Samaritan
069887	proclaiming the good news
069888	an angel
069889	Then
069890	of the Lord
069891	said
069892	to
069893	Philip,
069894	
069895	“Get up
069896	
069897	and go
069898	
069899	south
069900	on
069901	
069902	the road
069903	
069904	that goes down
069905	from
069906	Jerusalem
069907	to
069908	Gaza.”
069909	
069910	(This is
069911	a desert road.)
069912	
069913	So he got up
069914	and went.
069915	
069916	There
069917	
069918	he met an Ethiopian
069919	eunuch,
069920	a court official
069921	of Candace,
069922	queen
069923	of the Ethiopians,
069924	who
069925	was
069926	in charge of
069927	all
069928	
069929	her treasury.
069930	
069931	He
069932	had come
069933	to worship,
069934	to
069935	Jerusalem
069936	was
069937	and
069938	returning
069939	
069940	home, sitting
069941	in
069942	
069943	his chariot,
069944	
069945	
069946	reading
069947	
069948	the prophet
069949	Isaiah.
069950	said
069951	Then
069952	
069953	the Spirit
069954	
069955	to Philip,
069956	“Go over
069957	
069958	and join
069959	
069960	this chariot.”
069961	
069962	ran up to
069963	So
069964	
069965	Philip
069966	it and heard
069967	
069968	the man reading
069969	Isaiah.
069970	
069971	the prophet
069972	
069973	He asked
069974	
069975	
069976	him, “Do you understand
069977	what
069978	you’re reading?”
069979	
069980	
069981	The man replied,
069982	“How
069983	
069984	
069985	in the world can
069986	
069987	I, unless
069988	someone
069989	guides me?”
069990	
069991	he invited
069992	So
069993	
069994	Philip
069995	to come up
069996	and sit
069997	with him.
069998	
069999	
070000	Now
070001	the passage
070002	
070003	of scripture
070004	
070005	reading was this:
070006	the man was
070007	
070008	like
070009	a sheep
070010	to
070011	slaughter,
070012	“He was led
070013	
070014	and like
070015	a lamb
070016	before
070017	
070018	its shearer
070019	
070020	is silent,
070021	
070022	so he did not
070023	open
070024	
070025	his mouth.
070026	
070027	In
070028	
070029	humiliation
070030	
070031	
070032	justice
070033	
070034	was taken from him.
070035	
070036	his posterity?
070037	
070038	Who
070039	can describe
070040	
070041	was taken away
070042	from
070043	
070044	the earth.”
070045	
070046	For his life
070047	
070048	
070049	Then
070050	
070051	the eunuch
070052	
070053	to Philip,
070054	“Please tell
070055	this about –
070056	
070057	saying
070058	me, who
070059	
070060	is the prophet
070061	said
070062	
070063	
070064	himself
070065	or
070066	
070067	else?”
070068	someone
070069	
070070	So
070071	
070072	Philip
070073	
070074	started speaking,
070075	
070076	
070077	and beginning
070078	with
070079	
070080	this scripture
070081	
070082	proclaimed the good news
070083	
070084	
070085	about Jesus to him.
070086	as
070087	Now
070088	they were going
070089	along
070090	
070091	the road,
070092	they came
070093	to
070094	some
070095	water,
070096	
070097	said,
070098	
070099	and the eunuch
070100	“Look,
070101	there is water!
070102	What
070103	is to stop me
070104	
070105	from being baptized?”
070106	
070107	So he ordered
070108	to stop,
070109	
070110	the chariot
070111	
070112	went down
070113	and both
070114	into
070115	
070116	the water,
070117	
070118	
070119	Philip
070120	
070121	
070122	and the eunuch
070123	
070124	and Philip baptized him.
070125	
070126	when
070127	Now
070128	they came up
070129	out of
070130	
070131	the water,
070132	the Spirit
070133	of the Lord
070134	snatched
070135	
070136	Philip away,
070137	
070138	did not
070139	see him
070140	
070141	any more,
070142	
070143	and the eunuch
070144	went on
070145	but
070146	
070147	his way
070148	
070149	rejoicing.
070150	Philip,
070151	however,
070152	found
070153	himself at
070154	Azotus,
070155	
070156	and as he passed through
070157	the area, he proclaimed the good news
070158	
070159	the towns
070160	to all
070161	until
070162	
070163	he came
070164	
070165	to
070166	Caesarea.
070167	
070168	Meanwhile
070169	Saul,
070170	still
070171	breathing out
070172	threats
070173	
070174	to murder
070175	
070176	
070177	disciples,
070178	
070179	the Lord’s
070180	went
070181	
070182	to the high priest
070183	and requested
070184	from him
070185	
070186	letters
070187	in
070188	Damascus,
070189	to
070190	
070191	the synagogues
070192	so that
070193	if
070194	any
070195	he found
070196	
070197	to the Way,
070198	who belonged
070199	men
070200	either
070201	
070202	or women,
070203	them as prisoners
070204	he could bring
070205	to
070206	Jerusalem.
070207	As
070208	
070209	
070210	going along,
070211	he was
070212	
070213	approaching
070214	
070215	Damascus,
070216	suddenly
070217	
070218	
070219	flashed around him.
070220	a light
070221	from
070222	
070223	heaven
070224	
070225	He fell
070226	to
070227	
070228	the ground
070229	and heard
070230	a voice
070231	saying to him,
070232	
070233	“Saul,
070234	Saul,
070235	why
070236	
070237	are you persecuting me?”
070238	he said,
070239	So
070240	“Who
070241	are
070242	you, Lord?”
070243	
070244	
070245	
070246	He replied, “I am
070247	Jesus
070248	whom
070249	
070250	you are persecuting!
070251	But
070252	stand up
070253	
070254	and enter
070255	
070256	
070257	the city
070258	
070259	and you will be told
070260	
070261	what
070262	
070263	
070264	you must
070265	do.”
070266	
070267	(Now
070268	the men
070269	
070270	who were traveling with him
070271	
070272	stood
070273	there speechless,
070274	because they heard
070275	
070276	
070277	the voice
070278	no one.)
070279	but
070280	saw
070281	got up
070282	So
070283	Saul
070284	from
070285	
070286	the ground,
070287	were open,
070288	but
070289	
070290	although his eyes
070291	
070292	nothing.
070293	he could see
070294	Leading
070295	
070296	him by the hand,
070297	his companions brought him
070298	into
070299	Damascus.
070300	
070301	
070302	days
070303	For three
070304	he could not
070305	see,
070306	
070307	and he neither
070308	ate
070309	nor
070310	drank anything.
070311	there was
070312	Now
070313	
070314	a disciple
070315	in
070316	Damascus
070317	named
070318	Ananias.
070319	
070320	said
070321	to him
070322	
070323	in
070324	a vision,
070325	
070326	The Lord
070327	“Ananias,”
070328	
070329	and
070330	he replied,
070331	“Here
070332	
070333	I am, Lord.”
070334	
070335	Then
070336	the Lord told him,
070337	
070338	
070339	“Get up
070340	and go
070341	to
070342	
070343	the street
070344	
070345	called
070346	‘Straight,’
070347	
070348	look for
070349	and at
070350	house
070351	Judas’
070352	Saul.
070353	named
070354	a man from Tarsus
070355	
070356	For
070357	he is praying,
070358	
070359	and he has seen
070360	in a vision a man

070368	
070369	
070370	his hands on him
070371	so that
070372	he may see again.”
070373	replied,
070374	But
070375	Ananias
070376	“Lord,
070377	I have heard
070378	from
070379	many people
070380	about
070381	
070382	this man,
070383	
070384	how much
070385	harm
070386	
070387	to your saints
070388	
070389	he has done
070390	in
070391	Jerusalem,
070392	
070393	and here
070394	he has
070395	authority
070396	from
070397	
070398	the chief priests
070399	to imprison
070400	all
070401	
070402	who call on
070403	
070404	your name!”
070405	
070406	said
070407	But
070408	to him,
070409	
070410	
070411	the Lord
070412	“Go,
070413	
070414	instrument
070415	my chosen
070416	because this man is
070417	
070418

070420	to carry
070421	
070422	my name

070432	
070433	For
070434	I will show him
070435	
070436	how much
070437	he must

070439	for the sake
070440	
070441	of my name.”
070442	
070443	suffer
070444	departed
070445	So
070446	Ananias
070447	
070448	and entered
070449	
070450	
070451	the house,
070452	
070453	placed
070454	on
070455	
070456	
070457	his hands
070458	Saul and said,
070459	Saul,
070460	“Brother
070461	
070462	the Lord
070463	here, has sent me
070464	
070465	Jesus,
070466	
070467	who appeared to you
070468	
070469	on
070470	
070471	the road
070472	
070473	as you came
070474	so that
070475	you may see again
070476	
070477	and be filled
070478	Spirit.”
070479	with the Holy
070480	
070481	Immediately
070482	fell
070483	
070484	from
070485	
070486	his eyes,
070487	something like
070488	scales
070489	and he could see again.
070490	
070491	
070492	He got up
070493	and was baptized,
070494	
070495	and after taking
070496	some food,
070497	his strength returned.
070498	he was
070499	
070500	with
070501	
070502	in
070503	Damascus,
070504	the disciples
070505	days
070506	For several
070507	
070508	and immediately
070509	in
070510	
070511	the synagogues,
070512	he began to proclaim
070513	
070514	Jesus
070515	
070516	
070517	saying, “This man is
070518	
070519	the Son
070520	
070521	of God.”
070522	him were amazed
070523	
070524	All
070525	
070526	who heard
070527	
070528	and were saying,
070529	not
070530	this
070531	“Is
070532	
070533	was ravaging
070534	the man who in
070535	Jerusalem
070536	
070537	those who call on
070538	
070539	this name,
070540	
070541	
070542	here
070543	
070544	
070545	and who had come
070546	to
070547	as prisoners
070548	
070549	bring them
070550	to
070551	
070552	the chief priests?”
070553	Saul
070554	But
070555	became more and more
070556	capable,
070557	
070558	and was causing consternation
070559	
070560	among the Jews
070561	
070562	who lived
070563	in
070564	Damascus
070565	by proving
070566	
070567	
070568	that Jesus is
070569	
070570	the Christ.
070571	after
070572	Now
070573	had passed,
070574	days
070575	some
070576	plotted together
070577	
070578	the Jews
070579	to kill him,
070580	
070581	learned
070582	but
070583	
070584	Saul
070585	
070586	of their plot
070587	
070588	against him. They were also watching
070589	
070590	
070591	
070592	the city gates
070593	day
070594	
070595	
070596	and night
070597	so that
070598	
070599	they could kill him.
070600	took
070601	But
070602	
070603	his disciples
070604	
070605	him at night
070606	through
070607	
070608	an opening in the wall
070609	and let
070610	him down
070611	by lowering him
070612	in
070613	a basket.
070614	When he arrived
070615	
070616	in
070617	Jerusalem,
070618	he attempted
070619	to associate
070620	
070621	with the disciples,
070622	
070623	and they were all
070624	afraid of him,
070625	
070626	because they did not
070627	believe
070628	
070629	that he was
070630	a disciple.
070631	Barnabas
070632	But
070633	took
070634	
070635	Saul, brought him
070636	to
070637	
070638	the apostles,
070639	
070640	and related to them
070641	
070642	how
070643	on
070644	
070645	the road,
070646	he had seen
070647	
070648	the Lord
070649	
070650	
070651	that the Lord had spoken to him,
070652	
070653	
070654	and how
070655	in
070656	Damascus
070657	he had spoken out boldly
070658	in
070659	
070660	the name
070661	
070662	of Jesus.
070663	
070664	So he was
070665	staying with them,
070666	
070667	
070668	
070669	associating openly
070670	with them in
070671	Jerusalem,
070672	speaking out boldly
070673	in
070674	
070675	the name
070676	
070677	of the Lord.
070678	He was speaking
070679	
070680	
070681	and debating
070682	with
070683	
070684	the Greek-speaking Jews,
070685	
070686	but
070687	they were trying
070688	to kill him.
070689	
070690	found out about this,
070691	
070692	
070693	When the brothers
070694	they brought
070695	him down
070696	to
070697	Caesarea
070698	
070699	and sent
070700	him away
070701	to
070702	Tarsus.
070703	
070704	
070705	Then
070706	the church
070707	
070708	throughout
070709	
070710	Judea,
070711	
070712	Galilee,
070713	
070714	and Samaria
070715	experienced
070716	peace
070717	and thus was strengthened.
070718	
070719	Living
070720	
070721	in the fear
070722	
070723	of the Lord
070724	
070725	
070726	and in the encouragement
070727	
070728	of the Holy
070729	Spirit,
070730	the church increased in numbers.
070731	
070732	Now
070733	as Peter
070734	was traveling around
070735	
070736	from place to place,
070737	he also came down
070738	
070739	to
070740	
070741	the saints
070742	
070743	who lived
070744	in Lydda.
070745	He found
070746	
070747	there
070748	a man
070749	
070750	named
070751	Aeneas
070752	for
070753	years
070754	eight
070755	who had been confined
070756	to
070757	a mattress
070758	because he
070759	was
070760	paralyzed.
070761	
070762	said to him,
070763	
070764	
070765	Peter
070766	“Aeneas,
070767	heals you.
070768	
070769	Jesus
070770	the Christ
070771	Get up
070772	
070773	and make
070774	your own bed!”
070775	
070776	And immediately
070777	he got up.
070778	
070779	saw him,
070780	
070781	All
070782	
070783	those who lived
070784	in Lydda
070785	
070786	
070787	and Sharon
070788	and they
070789	turned
070790	to
070791	
070792	the Lord.
070793	in
070794	Joppa
070795	Now
070796	
070797	there was
070798	a disciple
070799	named
070800	Tabitha
070801	(which
070802	in translation
070803	means
070804	Dorcas).
070805	
070806	She was
070807	continually

070821	
070822	and died.
070823	When they had washed
070824	
070825	her body, they placed it
070826	
070827	in
070828	an upstairs room.

070836	when the disciples
070837	heard
070838	
070839	that Peter
070840	was
070841	
070842	there,
070843	they sent
070844	two
070845	men
070846	to
070847	him
070848	and urged
070849	without

070858	
070859	and when he
070860	arrived
070861	they brought
070862	him to
070863	
070864	the upper room.

070888	
070889	Peter
070890	
070891	down,
070892	
070893	knelt
070894	and prayed.
070895	
070896	Turning
070897	to
070898	
070899	the body,
070900	he said,
070901	“Tabitha,
070902	get up.”
070903	
070904	Then
070905	she opened
070906	
070907	her eyes,
070908	
070909	
070910	and when she saw
070911	
070912	Peter,
070913	she sat up.
070914	He gave
070915	
070916	
070917	her his hand
070918	and helped her
070919	get up.
070920	he called
070921	Then
070922	
070923	the saints
070924	
070925	
070926	and widows
070927	and presented her
070928	
070929	alive.
070930	known
070931	
070932	This became
070933	throughout
070934	all
070935

070937	
070938	believed
070939	and many
070940	in
070941	
070942	the Lord.
070943	
070944	So
070945	days
070946	many
070947	Peter stayed
070948	in
070949	Joppa
070950	with
070951	a man
070952	named Simon,
070953	a tanner.
070954	there was a man
070955	Now
070956	
070957	in
070958	Caesarea
070959	named
070960	Cornelius,
070961	a centurion
070962	of
070963	Cohort.
070964	
070965	what was known
070966	as the Italian
070967	He was a devout,
070968	
070969	fearing
070970	
070971	God-
070972	man, as was
070973	all
070974	
070975	his household;
070976	
070977	he did
070978	acts of charity
070979	many
070980	
070981	for the people
070982	
070983	and prayed
070984	
070985	to God
070986	
070987	regularly.
070988	he saw
070989	in
070990	a vision
070991	clearly
070992	About
070993	
070994	
070995	three o’clock
070996	
070997	one afternoon
070998	an angel
070999	
071000	of God
071001	who came in
071002	
071003	
071004	
071005	and said to him,
071006	
071007	“Cornelius.”
071008	
071009	
071010	Staring at him
071011	
071012	
071013	greatly afraid,
071014	and becoming
071015	Cornelius replied,
071016	“What
071017	is
071018	it, Lord?”
071019	The angel said
071020	
071021	
071022	
071023	to him, “Your prayers
071024	
071025	
071026	
071027	and your acts of charity
071028	
071029	have gone up
071030	as
071031	a memorial
071032	before
071033	
071034	God.
071035	
071036	Now
071037	send
071038	men
071039	to
071040	Joppa
071041	
071042	and summon
071043	named Simon,
071044	a man
071045	who
071046	is called
071047	Peter.
071048	
071049	This man is staying as a guest
071050	with
071051	a man
071052	named Simon,
071053	a tanner,
071054	whose
071055	is
071056	house
071057	by
071058	the sea.”
071059	When
071060	
071061	departed,
071062	
071063	the angel
071064	
071065	who had spoken to him
071066	
071067	Cornelius called
071068	two
071069	
071070	of his personal servants
071071	
071072	soldier
071073	and a devout
071074	
071075	from among those who served him,
071076	
071077	
071078	and when he had explained
071079	everything to them,
071080	
071081	he sent them
071082	
071083	to
071084	
071085	Joppa.
071086	
071087	
071088	the next day,
071089	were on their way
071090	while they
071091	
071092	
071093	the city,
071094	and approaching
071095	went up
071096	Peter
071097	on
071098	
071099	the roof
071100	to pray.
071101	About
071102	
071103	noon
071104	He became
071105	
071106	hungry
071107	
071108	and wanted
071109	to eat,
071110	while they were preparing
071111	but
071112	
071113	came
071114	over him.
071115	
071116	the meal, a trance
071117	
071118	He saw
071119	
071120	heaven
071121	opened
071122	
071123	descending,
071124	and an object
071125	something
071126	like
071127	sheet
071128	a large
071129	by its four
071130	corners.
071131	being let down
071132	to
071133	
071134	earth
071135	In
071136	it
071137	were
071138	all kinds
071139	
071140	of four-footed animals
071141	
071142	and reptiles
071143	
071144	of the earth
071145	
071146	birds.
071147	
071148	and wild
071149	
071150	said
071151	Then a voice
071152	to him,
071153	
071154	“Get up,
071155	Peter;
071156	slaughter
071157	
071158	and eat!”
071159	
071160	But
071161	Peter
071162	said,
071163	“Certainly not,
071164	Lord,
071165	
071166	for I have never
071167	eaten
071168	anything
071169	defiled
071170	and
071171	ritually unclean!”
071172	
071173	The voice
071174	again,
071175	
071176	a second time,
071177	spoke to him
071178	
071179	“What
071180	
071181	God
071182	has made clean, you
071183	
071184	must not
071185	consider ritually unclean!”
071186	
071187	
071188	This happened
071189	
071190	three times,
071191	
071192	and immediately
071193	was taken up
071194	
071195	the object
071196	into
071197	
071198	heaven.
071199	while
071200	Now
071201	
071202	
071203	was puzzling over
071204	
071205	Peter
071206	what
071207	
071208	could signify,
071209	
071210	the vision
071211	
071212	he had seen
071213	
071214	
071215	the men
071216	
071217	sent
071218	by
071219	
071220	Cornelius
071221	had learned
071222	
071223	house
071224	
071225	where Simon’s
071226	was and approached
071227	
071228	
071229	the gate.
071230	
071231	They called out
071232	to ask
071233	if
071234	Simon,
071235	
071236	known as
071237	Peter,
071238	there as a guest.
071239	was staying
071240	
071241	
071242	While Peter
071243	was still thinking seriously
071244	about
071245	
071246	the vision,
071247	said to him,
071248	
071249	
071250	the Spirit
071251	“Look!
071252	men
071253	Three
071254	are looking for you.
071255	
071256	But
071257	get up,
071258	go down,
071259	
071260	
071261	and accompany them
071262	
071263	without
071264	hesitation,
071265	
071266	
071267	because I have sent them.”
071268	
071269	went down
071270	So
071271	Peter
071272	to
071273	
071274	the men
071275	and said,
071276	“Here
071277	
071278	I am,
071279	the person
071280	you’re looking
071281	
071282	
071283	for. Why
071284	
071285	
071286	have you come?”
071287	
071288	
071289	They said,
071290	“Cornelius
071291	the centurion,
071292	man,
071293	a righteous
071294	
071295	fearing
071296	
071297	and God-
071298	well spoken of
071299	
071300	by
071301	the whole
071302	
071303	nation,
071304	
071305	Jewish
071306	was directed
071307	by
071308	angel
071309	a holy
071310	to summon you
071311	
071312	to
071313	
071314	his house
071315	
071316	
071317	and to hear
071318	a message
071319	from you.”
071320	
071321	Peter invited them in
071322	So
071323	them as guests.
071324	and entertained
071325	On the
071326	
071327	next day
071328	he got up
071329	and set out
071330	with them,
071331	
071332	
071333	and some
071334	
071335	of the brothers
071336	
071337	from
071338	Joppa
071339	accompanied him.
071340	
071341	
071342	
071343	The following day
071344	he entered
071345	
071346	
071347	Caesarea.
071348	
071349	Now
071350	Cornelius
071351	was
071352	waiting anxiously for them
071353	
071354	and had called together
071355	
071356	his relatives
071357	
071358	
071359	
071360	and close
071361	friends.
071362	when
071363	So
071364	came in,
071365	
071366	
071367	
071368	Peter
071369	met him,
071370	
071371	
071372	Cornelius
071373	fell
071374	at
071375	
071376	his feet,
071377	and worshiped him.
071378	
071379	But
071380	Peter
071381	helped
071382	him up,
071383	saying,
071384	“Stand up.
071385	
071386	
071387	
071388	a mere mortal.”
071389	I too am
071390	
071391	Peter continued talking with him
071392	
071393	as he went in,
071394	
071395	and he found
071396	gathered together.
071397	many people
071398	He said
071399	
071400	to them,
071401	
071402	
071403	“You know
071404	
071405	unlawful
071406	that it is
071407	
071408	for a Jew
071409	to associate
071410	with or
071411	visit
071412	a Gentile,
071413	me
071414	yet
071415	God
071416	has shown
071417	no person
071418	defiled
071419	or
071420	ritually unclean.
071421	that I should call
071422	
071423	Therefore
071424	
071425	without any objection.
071426	I came
071427	when you sent for me,
071428	may I ask
071429	Now
071430	
071431	why
071432	you sent for me?”
071433	
071434	
071435	
071436	Cornelius
071437	replied,
071438	
071439	“Four
071440	days
071441	ago at
071442	
071443	
071444	this very hour,
071445	I was
071446	
071447	at three o’clock in the afternoon,
071448	praying
071449	in
071450	
071451	my house,
071452	
071453	
071454	and suddenly
071455	a man
071456	stood
071457	before me
071458	
071459	in
071460	clothing
071461	shining
071462	
071463	and said,
071464	‘Cornelius,
071465	has been heard
071466	
071467	
071468	your prayer
071469	
071470	
071471	and your acts of charity
071472	
071473	have been remembered
071474	before
071475	
071476	God.
071477	send
071478	Therefore
071479	to
071480	Joppa
071481	
071482	and summon
071483	Simon,
071484	who
071485	is called
071486	Peter.
071487	
071488	This man is staying as a guest
071489	in
071490	the house
071491	of Simon
071492	the tanner,
071493	by
071494	the sea.’
071495	at once,
071496	Therefore
071497	I sent
071498	for you
071499	
071500	
071501	
071502	kind
071503	and you were
071504	enough to come.
071505	now
071506	So
071507	all here
071508	
071509	in the presence of
071510	
071511	God
071512	we are
071513	to listen
071514	to everything
071515	
071516	has commanded you to say to us.”
071517	
071518	
071519	
071520	the Lord
071521	started
071522	Then
071523	Peter
071524	
071525	speaking:
071526	
071527	
071528	“I now truly
071529	understand
071530	
071531	not

071543	
071544	and does
071545	what is right

071552	he sent
071553	
071554	to the people
071555	of Israel,
071556	proclaiming the good news
071557	of peace
071558	through
071559	Jesus
071560	Christ
071561	
071562	(he is
071563	of all) –

071573	Judea,
071574	beginning
071575	from
071576	
071577	Galilee
071578	after
071579	
071580	the baptism
071581	that
071582	announced:
071583	John
071584	with respect to Jesus
071585	
071586	from
071587	Nazareth,

071594	with the Holy
071595	
071596	and with power.
071597	He
071598	went around
071599	doing good
071600	
071601	and healing
071602	all
071603	
071604	who were oppressed
071605	by
071606	
071607	the devil,
071608	
071609	
071610	because God
071611	was
071612	with him.
071613	
071614	
071615	
071616	We are witnesses
071617	of all
071618	the things
071619	he did
071620	in
071621	both
071622	
071623	
071624	
071625	Judea
071626	
071627	and in
071628	Jerusalem.
071629	him
071630	
071631	They killed
071632	by hanging
071633	him on
071634	a tree,
071635	him up
071636	
071637	but God
071638	raised
071639	on
071640	
071641	the third
071642	day
071643	
071644	and caused him
071645	
071646	seen,
071647	to be
071648	not
071649	by all
071650	
071651	the people,
071652	but
071653	the witnesses
071654	
071655	had already chosen,
071656	by us,
071657	
071658	God
071659	
071660	who
071661	ate
071662	
071663	and drank with him
071664	
071665	after
071666	
071667	he rose
071668	
071669	from
071670	the dead.
071671	
071672	He commanded us
071673	
071674	to preach
071675	
071676	to the people
071677	
071678	and to warn
071679	
071680	
071681	them that he is
071682	
071683	the one appointed
071684	by
071685	
071686	God
071687	as judge
071688	of the living
071689	
071690	and the dead.
071691	
071692	About him all
071693	
071694	the prophets
071695	testify,
071696	forgiveness
071697	of sins
071698	receives
071699	through
071700	
071701	his name.”
071702	
071703	that everyone
071704	
071705	who believes
071706	in him
071707	
071708	was still
071709	speaking
071710	
071711	While Peter
071712	
071713	these words,
071714	
071715	fell
071716	
071717	Spirit
071718	
071719	the Holy
071720	on
071721	all
071722	
071723	those who heard
071724	
071725	the message.
071726	
071727	were greatly astonished
071728	
071729	
071730	The circumcised
071731	believers
071732	
071733	who had accompanied
071734	
071735	Peter
071736	
071737	
071738	even on
071739	
071740	the Gentiles,
071741	
071742	that the gift
071743	
071744	of the Holy
071745	Spirit
071746	had been poured out
071747	they heard them
071748	for
071749	
071750	speaking
071751	in tongues
071752	
071753	and praising
071754	
071755	God.
071756	Then
071757	said,
071758	Peter
071759	
071760	
071761	the water
071762	can
071763	withhold
071764	“No one
071765	
071766	
071767	for these people to be baptized,
071768	
071769	who
071770	
071771	Spirit
071772	
071773	the Holy
071774	have received
071775	just as we did, can he?”
071776	
071777	
071778	he gave orders to have them
071779	So
071780	
071781	in
071782	
071783	the name
071784	of Jesus
071785	Christ.
071786	baptized
071787	Then
071788	they asked him
071789	
071790	to stay
071791	days.
071792	for several
071793	heard
071794	Now
071795	
071796	the apostles
071797	
071798	
071799	and the brothers
071800	
071801	who were
071802	throughout
071803	
071804	Judea
071805	
071806	
071807	
071808	that the Gentiles
071809	too had accepted
071810	
071811	the word
071812	
071813	of God.
071814	when
071815	So
071816	went up
071817	Peter
071818	to
071819	Jerusalem,
071820	believers took issue
071821	with him,
071822	
071823	
071824	
071825	the circumcised
071826	saying,
071827	
071828	“You went
071829	to
071830	men
071831	uncircumcised
071832	
071833	
071834	and shared a meal with them.”
071835	
071836	began
071837	But
071838	Peter
071839	and explained it to them
071840	
071841	point by point,
071842	saying,
071843	
071844	“I was
071845	in
071846	the city
071847	of Joppa
071848	praying,
071849	
071850	I saw
071851	and in
071852	a trance
071853	a vision,
071854	descending,
071855	an object
071856	something
071857	like
071858	sheet
071859	a large
071860	by its four
071861	corners,
071862	being let down
071863	from
071864	
071865	heaven
071866	
071867	and it came
071868	to me.
071869	
071870	into
071871	it
071872	As I stared
071873	I looked
071874	
071875	and saw
071876	
071877	four-footed animals
071878	
071879	of the earth,
071880	
071881	
071882	wild animals,
071883	
071884	
071885	reptiles,
071886	
071887	
071888	birds.
071889	
071890	and wild
071891	I also heard
071892	
071893	
071894	a voice
071895	saying to me,
071896	
071897	‘Get up,
071898	Peter;
071899	slaughter
071900	
071901	and eat!’
071902	I said,
071903	But
071904	‘Certainly not,
071905	Lord,
071906	
071907	defiled
071908	or
071909	ritually unclean
071910	for nothing
071911	has ever entered
071912	
071913	
071914	my mouth!’
071915	
071916	replied
071917	But
071918	the voice
071919	from
071920	a second time
071921	
071922	
071923	heaven,
071924	‘What
071925	
071926	God
071927	has made clean, you
071928	
071929	must not
071930	consider ritually unclean!’
071931	
071932	
071933	This happened
071934	
071935	three times,
071936	
071937	was pulled up
071938	again.
071939	and then everything
071940	to
071941	
071942	heaven
071943	
071944	
071945	At that very moment,
071946	three
071947	men
071948	approached
071949	
071950	
071951	the house
071952	
071953	where
071954	we were staying.
071955	sent
071956	from
071957	Caesarea
071958	to me
071959	
071960	told me
071961	
071962	
071963	The Spirit
071964	
071965	to accompany them
071966	
071967	without
071968	hesitation.
071969	also went
071970	
071971	with me,
071972	
071973	
071974	
071975	These six
071976	brothers
071977	
071978	
071979	and we entered
071980	
071981	
071982	house.
071983	
071984	the man’s
071985	He informed us
071986	
071987	
071988	how
071989	he had seen
071990	
071991	an angel
071992	in
071993	
071994	his house
071995	
071996	standing
071997	
071998	and saying,
071999	‘Send
072000	to
072001	Joppa
072002	
072003	and summon
072004	Simon,
072005	
072006	who is called
072007	Peter,
072008	who
072009	will speak
072010	a message
072011	to you
072012	
072013	by
072014	which you
072015	will be saved.’
072016	
072017	
072018	and your entire
072019	
072020	household
072021	
072022	at
072023	Then
072024	
072025	as I began
072026	
072027	to speak,
072028	fell
072029	
072030	Spirit
072031	
072032	the Holy
072033	on them
072034	
072035	just as
072036	
072037	he did on us
072038	
072039	
072040	the beginning.
072041	I remembered
072042	And
072043	
072044	the word
072045	
072046	of the Lord,
072047	as
072048	he used to say,
072049	‘John
072050	
072051	baptized
072052	with water,
072053	
072054	but
072055	you will be baptized
072056	with
072057	Spirit.’
072058	the Holy
072059	if
072060	Therefore
072061	
072062	the same
072063	gift
072064	gave them
072065	
072066	
072067	God
072068	as
072069	
072070	
072071	he also gave us after believing
072072	in
072073	
072074	the Lord
072075	Jesus
072076	Christ,
072077	
072078	who
072079	was
072080	
072081	I to hinder
072082	
072083	God?”
072084	When they heard this,
072085	
072086	
072087	they ceased their objections
072088	
072089	and praised
072090	
072091	God,
072092	saying,
072093	“So then,
072094	
072095	
072096	even to the Gentiles.”
072097	
072098	God
072099	
072100	the repentance
072101	that leads to
072102	life
072103	has granted
072104	
072105	
072106	Now
072107	those who had been scattered
072108	because of
072109	
072110	the persecution
072111	
072112	that took place
072113	over
072114	Stephen
072115	went
072116	as far as
072117	Phoenicia,
072118	
072119	Cyprus,
072120	
072121	and Antioch,
072122	to no one
072123	speaking
072124	
072125	the message
072126	
072127	but
072128	
072129	Jews.
072130	there were
072131	But
072132	some
072133	
072134	
072135	men
072136	from Cyprus
072137	
072138	and Cyrene
072139	among them who
072140	came
072141	to
072142	Antioch
072143	and began to speak
072144	
072145	to
072146	
072147	the Greeks
072148	too, proclaiming the good news
072149	
072150	of the Lord
072151	Jesus.
072152	
072153	was
072154	The hand
072155	of the Lord
072156	with them,
072157	
072158	a great
072159	and
072160	number
072161	
072162	who believed
072163	turned
072164	to
072165	
072166	the Lord.
072167	came
072168	
072169	
072170	A report
072171	to
072172	
072173	the attention
072174	
072175	of the church
072176	
072177	
072178	in
072179	Jerusalem,
072180	about them
072181	
072182	
072183	and they sent
072184	Barnabas
072185	
072186	to
072187	Antioch.
072188	When he
072189	came
072190	
072191	and saw
072192	
072193	the grace
072194	
072195	
072196	of God,
072197	he rejoiced
072198	
072199	and encouraged
072200	them all
072201	
072202	with devoted
072203	
072204	hearts,
072205	to remain true
072206	
072207	to the Lord
072208	
072209	because he was
072210	man,
072211	a good
072212	
072213	full
072214	Spirit
072215	of the Holy
072216	
072217	and of faith,
072218	
072219	were brought
072220	of people
072221	and a significant number
072222	
072223	to the Lord.
072224	Barnabas departed
072225	Then
072226	for
072227	Tarsus
072228	to look for
072229	Saul,
072230	
072231	and when he found
072232	him, he brought
072233	him to
072234	Antioch.
072235	
072236	So
072237	
072238	
072239	year
072240	for a whole
072241	Barnabas and Saul met
072242	with
072243	
072244	the church
072245	
072246	and taught
072247	of people.
072248	a significant number
072249	called
072250	Now
072251	were first
072252	it was in
072253	Antioch
072254	
072255	that the disciples
072256	Christians.
072257	At
072258	
072259	
072260	
072261	that time
072262	came down
072263	from
072264	Jerusalem
072265	some prophets
072266	to
072267	Antioch.
072268	got up
072269	
072270	One
072271	of them,
072272	
072273	named
072274	Agabus,
072275	and predicted
072276	by
072277	
072278	the Spirit
072279	famine
072280	that a severe
072281	was about
072282	to come
072283	over
072284	the whole
072285	
072286	inhabited world.
072287	(This
072288	took place
072289	during
072290	the reign of Claudius.)
072291	
072292	So
072293	the disciples,
072294	in accordance with
072295	his financial ability,
072296	
072297	decided
072298	each
072299	
072300	
072301	relief
072302	to send
072303	
072304	living
072305	in

072363	
072364	When he had seized

072368	handing him over
072369	to four
072370	squads
072371	of soldiers
072372	to guard him.
072373	
072374	Herod planned

072377	the Passover.
072378	to bring
072379	him out
072380	
072381	for public trial
072382	
072383	
072384	So
072385	Peter
072386	was kept
072387	in
072388	
072389	prison,
072390	praying
072391	but
072392	were
072393	earnestly
072394	
072395	those in

072397	the church
072398	to
072399	
072400	God
072401	for him.
072402	
072403	before
072404	
072405	was going
072406	to bring
072407	him out for trial,
072408	
072409	Herod
072410	
072411	very night
072412	On that
072413	
072414	
072415	Peter
072416	was sleeping
072417	between
072418	two
072419	soldiers,
072420	bound
072421	chains,
072422	with two
072423	while guards
072424	
072425	in front of
072426	
072427	the door
072428	were keeping watch over
072429	
072430	the prison.
072431	
072432	Suddenly
072433	an angel
072434	of the Lord
072435	appeared,
072436	
072437	and a light
072438	shone
072439	in
072440	
072441	the prison cell.
072442	He struck
072443	
072444	
072445	on the side
072446	
072447	Peter
072448	and woke
072449	him up,
072450	saying,
072451	“Get up
072452	
072453	quickly!”
072454	
072455	fell off
072456	
072457	
072458	And the chains
072459	
072460	
072461	Peter’s wrists.
072462	said
072463	
072464	
072465	The angel
072466	to him,
072467	
072468	“Fasten your belt
072469	
072470	and put on
072471	
072472	your sandals.”
072473	
072474	Peter did
072475	
072476	so.
072477	
072478	“Put on
072479	
072480	Then the angel said to him,
072481	
072482	your cloak
072483	
072484	
072485	and follow me.”
072486	
072487	
072488	Peter went out
072489	and followed
072490	
072491	him; he did not
072492	realize
072493	
072494	was real,
072495	
072496	
072497	that what was happening
072498	through
072499	
072500	the angel
072501	thought
072502	but
072503	a vision.
072504	he was seeing
072505	After they had passed
072506	
072507	the first
072508	guards,
072509	
072510	and second
072511	they came
072512	to
072513	
072514	gate
072515	
072516	the iron
072517	
072518	leading
072519	into
072520	
072521	the city.
072522	
072523	by itself,
072524	It opened for them
072525	
072526	
072527	and they went outside
072528	and walked down
072529	narrow street,
072530	one
072531	
072532	when at once
072533	left him.
072534	
072535	the angel
072536	
072537	
072538	
072539	
072540	When Peter
072541	to
072542	himself,
072543	came
072544	he said,
072545	“Now
072546	I know
072547	for certain
072548	
072549	has sent
072550	
072551	that the Lord
072552	
072553	his angel
072554	
072555	
072556	and rescued me
072557	
072558	from
072559	the hand
072560	of Herod
072561	
072562	and from everything
072563	
072564	were expecting to happen.”
072565	
072566	people
072567	
072568	the Jewish
072569	When Peter realized
072570	
072571	this, he went
072572	to
072573	
072574	the house
072575	
072576	of Mary,
072577	
072578	the mother
072579	of John
072580	
072581	
072582	Mark,
072583	where
072584	had
072585	many people
072586	gathered together
072587	
072588	and were praying.
072589	When he knocked
072590	
072591	
072592	
072593	at the door
072594	
072595	of the outer gate,
072596	
072597	a slave girl
072598	answered.
072599	named
072600	Rhoda
072601	
072602	When she recognized
072603	
072604	voice,
072605	
072606	Peter’s
072607	
072608	
072609	she was so overjoyed
072610	she did not
072611	open
072612	
072613	the gate,
072614	ran back in
072615	but
072616	and told
072617	was standing
072618	
072619	them that Peter
072620	at
072621	
072622	the gate.
072623	
072624	But
072625	to her,
072626	
072627	they said
072628	“You’ve lost your mind!”
072629	
072630	But
072631	she kept insisting
072632	that
072633	it was
072634	
072635	Peter, and
072636	“It is
072637	
072638	his angel!”
072639	they kept saying,
072640	
072641	
072642	Now
072643	Peter
072644	continued
072645	knocking,
072646	when they opened
072647	and
072648	the door and saw him,
072649	
072650	
072651	they were greatly astonished.
072652	He motioned to them
072653	
072654	
072655	
072656	with his hand
072657	to be quiet
072658	and then related
072659	
072660	how
072661	
072662	the Lord
072663	him out
072664	had brought
072665	of
072666	
072667	the prison.
072668	He said,
072669	
072670	“Tell
072671	James
072672	
072673	
072674	and the brothers
072675	
072676	
072677	these things,” and then he left
072678	and went
072679	to
072680	another
072681	place.
072682	had become
072683	
072684	At daybreak
072685	there was
072686	consternation
072687	
072688	great
072689	among
072690	
072691	the soldiers
072692	over what
072693	
072694	
072695	of Peter.
072696	
072697	When Herod
072698	
072699	had searched for him
072700	
072701	
072702	and did not
072703	find
072704	him, he questioned
072705	
072706	the guards
072707	and commanded
072708	that they be led away to execution.
072709	
072710	Then Herod went down
072711	from
072712	
072713	Judea
072714	to
072715	Caesarea
072716	and stayed there.
072717	
072718	Now
072719	Herod was having an angry quarrel
072720	with the people of Tyre
072721	and
072722	Sidon.
072723	they joined together
072724	So
072725	and presented
072726	themselves before him.
072727	
072728	
072729	And after convincing
072730	Blastus,
072731	
072732	
072733	
072734	personal assistant, to help them,
072735	
072736	the king’s
072737	they asked
072738	for peace,
072739	because
072740	
072741	their country’s food supply was provided
072742	
072743	
072744	country.
072745	by
072746	
072747	the king’s
072748	determined in advance,
072749	
072750	On a day
072751	
072752	Herod
072753	put on
072754	robes,
072755	his royal
072756	
072757	sat down
072758	on
072759	
072760	the judgment seat,
072761	and made a speech
072762	to them.
072763	
072764	
072765	But
072766	the crowd
072767	began to shout,
072768	of a god,
072769	“The voice
072770	
072771	and not
072772	of a man!”
072773	Immediately
072774	
072775	struck
072776	Herod down
072777	an angel
072778	of the Lord
072779	because
072780	
072781	he did not
072782	give
072783	
072784	the glory
072785	
072786	to God,
072787	
072788	and he was
072789	eaten by worms
072790	and died.
072791	
072792	But
072793	the word
072794	
072795	of God
072796	kept on increasing
072797	
072798	and multiplying.
072799	Barnabas
072800	So
072801	
072802	and Saul
072803	returned
072804	to
072805	Jerusalem
072806	when they had completed
072807	
072808	their mission,
072809	bringing along with
072810	them John
072811	
072812	
072813	Mark.
072814	there were
072815	Now
072816	at
072817	Antioch:
072818	
072819	
072820	
072821	in the church
072822	these prophets
072823	
072824	and teachers
072825	
072826	
072827	Barnabas,
072828	
072829	Simeon
072830	
072831	called
072832	Niger,
072833	
072834	Lucius
072835	
072836	the Cyrenian,
072837	Manaen
072838	
072839	(a close friend of Herod
072840	
072841	the tetrarch
072842	from childhood)
072843	
072844	and Saul.
072845	While they were serving
072846	
072847	
072848	
072849	the Lord
072850	
072851	and fasting,
072852	said,
072853	
072854	Spirit
072855	
072856	the Holy
072857	“Set apart
072858	
072859	for me
072860	
072861	Barnabas
072862	
072863	and Saul
072864	for
072865	
072866	the work
072867	to which
072868	I have called them.”
072869	
072870	Then,
072871	after they had fasted
072872	
072873	and prayed
072874	
072875	and placed
072876	
072877	their hands on them,
072878	
072879	they sent them off.
072880	
072881	
072882	So
072883	Barnabas and Saul, sent out
072884	by
072885	
072886	the Holy
072887	Spirit,
072888	went down
072889	to
072890	Seleucia,
072891	and from there
072892	
072893	they sailed
072894	to
072895	Cyprus.
072896	
072897	When they arrived
072898	in
072899	Salamis,
072900	they began to proclaim
072901	
072902	the word
072903	
072904	of God
072905	in
072906	
072907	synagogues.
072908	
072909	the Jewish
072910	they also had
072911	(Now
072912	
072913	John
072914	as their assistant.)
072915	When they had crossed over
072916	
072917	the whole
072918	
072919	island
072920	as far as
072921	Paphos,
072922	they found
072923	
072924	
072925	a magician,
072926	false prophet
072927	a Jewish
072928	
072929	named
072930	Bar-Jesus,
072931	who
072932	was
072933	with
072934	
072935	the proconsul
072936	Sergius
072937	Paulus,
072938	man.
072939	an intelligent

072941	The proconsul summoned
072942	Barnabas
072943	
072944	and Saul
072945	and wanted
072946	to hear
072947	
072948	the word
072949	
072950	of God.
072951	opposed them,
072952	But
072953	
072954	Elymas
072955	
072956	the magician
072957	that is the way
072958	(for
072959	is translated)
072960	
072961	his name
072962	
072963	trying
072964	to turn
072965	
072966	the proconsul
072967	away from
072968	
072969	the faith.
072970	Saul
072971	But
072972	
072973	
072974	(also known as Paul),
072975	filled
072976	Spirit,
072977	with the Holy
072978	stared straight
072979	at him
072980	
072981	and said,
072982	“You who are
072983	full
072984	of all
072985	deceit
072986	
072987	and all

072989	you son
072990	of the devil,
072991	you enemy
072992	of all
072993	righteousness –
072994	will you not
072995	stop
072996	making crooked
072997	
072998	paths
072999	
073000	of the Lord?
073001	
073002	the straight

073004	Now
073005	look,
073006	the hand
073007	of the Lord
073008	is against you,

073011	and you will be
073012	blind,
073013	unable
073014	to see
073015	
073016	the sun
073017	for
073018	a time!”
073019	Immediately
073020	
073021	came
073022	over him,
073023	
073024	mistiness
073025	
073026	and darkness
073027	
073028	and he went around
073029	seeking
073030	people to lead him by the hand.
073031	Then
073032	saw
073033	
073034	when the proconsul
073035	
073036	what had happened,
073037	he believed,
073038	because he was greatly astounded
073039	at
073040	
073041	the teaching
073042	
073043	about the Lord.
073044	put out to sea
073045	Then

073048	Paphos
073049

073054	Perga
073055	
073056	in Pamphylia,
073057	John
073058	but
073059	left them
073060	
073061	
073062	and returned
073063	to
073064	Jerusalem.
073065	
073066	
073067	Moving on
073068	from
073069	
073070	Perga,
073071	they arrived
073072	at
073073	Antioch,
073074	
073075	Pisidian
073076	
073077	they went
073078	into

073082	day
073083	
073084	and on the Sabbath
073085	and sat down.
073086	After
073087	
073088	
073089	the reading
073090	
073091	from the law
073092	
073093	
073094	and the prophets,
073095	sent them
073096	
073097	the leaders of the synagogue
073098	for
073099	
073100	a message, saying,
073101	
073102	“Brothers,
073103	if
073104	any
073105	you have
073106	
073107	
073108	message
073109	of exhortation
073110	
073111	
073112	the people,
073113	speak it.”
073114	stood up,
073115	So
073116	Paul
073117	
073118	gestured
073119	
073120	with his hand
073121	and said,
073122	“Men
073123	of Israel,
073124	
073125	
073126	and you Gentiles who fear
073127	
073128	God,
073129	listen:
073130	
073131	The God

073135	Israel
073136	chose
073137	
073138	our ancestors
073139	
073140	and made
073141	
073142	the people
073143	great
073144	during
073145	
073146	their stay as foreigners
073147	in
073148	the country
073149	of Egypt,
073150	
073151	and with
073152	arm
073153	uplifted
073154	he led them
073155	
073156	out of it.
073157	
073158	
073159	of about
073160	forty years
073161	For a period
073162	he put up with them
073163	
073164	in
073165	
073166	the wilderness.
073167	After
073168	he had destroyed
073169	nations
073170	seven
073171	in
073172	the land
073173	of Canaan,
073174	as an inheritance.
073175	
073176	land
073177	he gave his people their

073179	years.
073180	four hundred

073186	this he gave
073187	them judges
073188	until
073189	the time of Samuel
073190	
073191	the prophet.
073192	Then
073193	they asked
073194	for a king,
073195	
073196	gave them
073197	
073198	
073199	and God
073200	
073201	Saul
073202	son
073203	of Kish,
073204	a man
073205	from
073206	the tribe
073207	of Benjamin,
073208	years.
073209	who ruled forty

073211	After removing him,
073212	
073213	God raised up
073214	
073215	David

073217	
073218	their king.
073219	about him:
073220	
073221	
073222	He testified
073223	‘I have found
073224	David
073225	
073226	
073227	the son of Jesse
073228	to be a man
073229	after

073231	my heart,
073232	
073233	who
073234	will accomplish
073235	everything
073236	
073237	I want him to do.’
073238	
073239	
073240	
073241	of this man God
073242	From
073243	
073244	the descendants
073245	just as
073246	he promised.
073247	brought
073248	
073249	to Israel
073250	a Savior,
073251	Jesus,
073252	had proclaimed
073253	John
073254	Before
073255	
073256	
073257	Jesus arrived,
073258	
073259	a baptism
073260	for repentance
073261	to all
073262	
073263	the people
073264	of Israel.
073265	while
073266	But
073267	was completing
073268	John
073269	
073270	his mission,
073271	he said repeatedly,
073272	‘What
073273	
073274	do you think
073275	I am?
073276	not
073277	I am
073278	
073279	he. But
073280	look,
073281	one is coming
073282	after me.
073283	
073284	
073285	not
073286	I am
073287	worthy
073288	
073289	the sandals
073290	
073291	on his feet!’
073292	to untie

073294	Brothers,
073295	descendants
073296	family,
073297	of Abraham’s
073298	
073299	
073300	and those Gentiles among
073301	
073302	you who fear
073303	
073304	God,
073305	
073306	
073307	the message
073308	
073309	of this salvation
073310	
073311	has been sent to us.
073312	
073313	For
073314	the people who live
073315	in
073316	Jerusalem
073317	
073318	
073319	and their rulers
073320	
073321	
073322	did not recognize
073323	
073324	
073325	the sayings
073326	
073327	of the prophets
073328	
073329	by
073330	every
073331	Sabbath
073332	that are read
073333	condemning him.
073334	him, and they fulfilled
073335	
073336	no
073337	basis
073338	for a death sentence,
073339	Though they found
073340	they asked
073341	Pilate to have him
073342	executed.
073343	
073344	When
073345	
073346	they had accomplished
073347	everything
073348	
073349	about him,
073350	
073351	that was written
073352	they took him down
073353	from
073354	
073355	the cross
073356	and placed
073357	him in
073358	a tomb.
073359	
073360	But
073361	God
073362	raised him
073363	
073364	from
073365	the dead,
073366	
073367	he appeared
073368	
073369	days
073370	and for many
073371	
073372	to those who had accompanied him
073373	
073374	from
073375	
073376	Galilee
073377	to
073378	Jerusalem.
073379	These
073380	now
073381	are
073382	his witnesses
073383	
073384	to
073385	
073386	the people.
073387	And
073388	we
073389	proclaim to you
073390	the good news
073391	
073392	about
073393	
073394	to our ancestors,
073395	the promise
073396	
073397	
073398	
073399	
073400	that this promise God
073401	has fulfilled to us,
073402	
073403	their children,
073404	
073405	
073406	by raising
073407	Jesus,
073408	as
073409	
073410	in
073411	
073412	psalm,
073413	also it is written
073414	
073415	the second
073416	my Son;
073417	
073418	‘You are
073419	
073420	
073421	today
073422	I have fathered you.’
073423	
073424	
073425	But
073426	regarding the fact that he has raised
073427	
073428	Jesus from
073429	the dead,
073430	never again
073431	to be
073432	in a state
073433	of
073434	decay,
073435	in this way:
073436	God has spoken
073437	
073438	‘I will give you
073439	
073440	
073441	the holy
073442	promises made to David.’
073443	
073444	and trustworthy
073445	Therefore
073446	
073447	in
073448	another
073449	he also says
073450	psalm, ‘You will not
073451	permit
073452	
073453	your Holy One
073454	
073455	to experience
073456	decay.’
073457	David,
073458	
073459	For
073460	in his own
073461	generation,
073462	after he had served
073463	
073464	
073465	God’s
073466	purpose
073467	died,
073468	
073469	was buried
073470	with
073471	
073472	his ancestors,
073473	
073474	
073475	and experienced
073476	decay,
073477	the one whom
073478	but
073479	
073480	God
073481	raised up
073482	did not
073483	experience
073484	decay.
073485	known to you,
073486	Therefore
073487	let it be
073488	
073489	
073490	brothers,
073491	
073492	that through
073493	
073494	
073495	this one forgiveness
073496	of sins
073497	is proclaimed to you,
073498	
073499	from
073500	everything
073501	from which
073502	not
073503	could
073504	
073505	the law
073506	of Moses
073507	justify you.
073508	and by
073509	
073510	this one everyone
073511	
073512	who believes
073513	is justified
073514	Watch out,
073515	then,
073516	does not
073517	happen to you:
073518	
073519	that what is spoken
073520	about by
073521	
073522	the prophets
073523	‘Look,
073524	
073525	you scoffers;
073526	
073527	be amazed
073528	
073529	and perish!
073530	
073531	a work
073532	For I am doing
073533	
073534	in
073535	
073536	your days,
073537	
073538	a work
073539	
073540	
073541	you would never
073542	believe,
073543	even if
073544	someone
073545	tells you.’”
073546	
073547	As Paul and Barnabas were going out,
073548	
073549	
073550	the people were urging them
073551	on
073552	
073553	the next
073554	Sabbath.
073555	to speak
073556	
073557	
073558	about these things
073559	
073560	had broken up,
073561	
073562	
073563	When the meeting of the synagogue
073564	followed
073565	many
073566	
073567	of the Jews
073568	
073569	
073570	and God-fearing
073571	proselytes
073572	
073573	Paul
073574	
073575	
073576	and Barnabas,
073577	who
073578	were speaking with them
073579	
073580	and were persuading them
073581	
073582	to continue
073583	
073584	in the grace
073585	
073586	of God.
073587	
073588	
073589	On the next
073590	Sabbath
073591	almost
073592	the whole
073593	
073594	city
073595	assembled together
073596	to hear
073597	
073598	the word
073599	
073600	of the Lord.
073601	saw
073602	But
073603	
073604	when the Jews
073605	
073606	the crowds,
073607	they were filled
073608	with jealousy,
073609	
073610	and they began to contradict
073611	
073612	by
073613	what Paul
073614	was saying
073615	reviling him.
073616	courageously,
073617	Both
073618	
073619	Paul
073620	
073621	
073622	and Barnabas
073623	replied
073624	
073625	“It was
073626	necessary
073627	first.
073628	to speak
073629	
073630	the word
073631	
073632	of God to you
073633	Since
073634	you reject it
073635	
073636	
073637	and do not
073638	worthy
073639	consider
073640	yourselves
073641	
073642	of eternal
073643	life,
073644	
073645	we are turning
073646	to
073647	
073648	the Gentiles.
073649	this is what
073650	For
073651	has commanded us:
073652	
073653	
073654	the Lord
073655	‘I have appointed you
073656	
073657	to
073658	a light
073659	for the Gentiles,
073660	
073661	be
073662	
073663	to
073664	bring salvation
073665	to
073666	the ends
073667	
073668	of the earth.’”
073669	heard
073670	
073671	
073672	When the Gentiles
073673	this, they began to rejoice
073674	
073675	and praise
073676	
073677	the word
073678	
073679	of the Lord,
073680	
073681	believed.
073682	and all
073683	who had been
073684	appointed
073685	for
073686	life
073687	eternal
073688	was spreading
073689	So
073690	
073691	the word
073692	
073693	of the Lord
073694	through
073695	the entire
073696	
073697	region.
073698	
073699	But
073700	the Jews
073701	incited
073702	
073703	the God-fearing
073704	women
073705	
073706	of high social standing
073707	
073708	
073709	and the prominent men
073710	
073711	of the city,
073712	
073713	stirred up

073718	
073719	and Barnabas,
073720	
073721	and threw them
073722	
073723	out of
073724	
073725	their region.
073726	
073727	
073728	So
073729	after they shook
073730	
073731	the dust off
073732	
073733	their feet
073734	in protest against them,
073735	
073736	they went
073737	to
073738	Iconium.
073739	
073740	And
073741	the disciples
073742	were filled
073743	with joy

073746	and with the Holy

073748	
073749	in
073750	Iconium
073751	
073752	
073753	
073754	when Paul and Barnabas went

073771	group
073772	
073773	But
073774	who refused to believe
073775	the Jews
073776	stirred up
073777	
073778	and poisoned
073779	
073780	their minds
073781	
073782	the Gentiles
073783	against
073784	
073785	the brothers.
073786	there for a considerable
073787	
073788	So
073789	time,
073790	they stayed
073791	speaking out courageously
073792	for
073793	
073794	the Lord,
073795	
073796	who testified
073797	
073798	
073799	to the message
073800	
073801	of his grace,
073802	
073803	granting
073804	miraculous signs
073805	
073806	and wonders
073807	to be performed
073808	through
073809	
073810	their hands.
073811	
073812	was divided;
073813	But
073814	
073815	the population
073816	
073817	of the city
073818	
073819	
073820	
073821	some sided
073822	with
073823	
073824	the Jews,
073825	
073826	and
073827	some with
073828	
073829	the apostles.
073830	
073831	
073832	made
073833	an attempt
073834	
073835	the Gentiles
073836	When both
073837	
073838	and the Jews
073839	(together with
073840	
073841	their rulers)
073842	
073843	to mistreat them
073844	
073845	and stone them,
073846	
073847	Paul and Barnabas learned
073848	about it and fled
073849	to
073850	
073851	cities
073852	
073853	the Lycaonian
073854	of Lystra
073855	
073856	and Derbe
073857	
073858	
073859	and the surrounding region.
073860	There
073861	to proclaim the good news.
073862	they continued
073863	
073864	
073865	a man
073866	who could not use
073867	In
073868	Lystra
073869	
073870	his feet,
073871	sat
073872	lame
073873	from
073874	birth,
073875	
073876	
073877	who
073878	had never
073879	walked.
073880	
073881	This man was listening
073882	
073883	to Paul
073884	as he was speaking.
073885	When Paul
073886	stared intently at him
073887	
073888	
073889	and saw
073890	
073891	he had
073892	faith
073893	
073894	to be healed,
073895	he said
073896	with a loud
073897	voice,
073898	“Stand
073899	on
073900	
073901	your feet.”
073902	
073903	upright
073904	
073905	And the man leaped up
073906	
073907	and began walking.
073908	
073909	So
073910	when the crowds
073911	saw
073912	what
073913	had done,
073914	Paul
073915	
073916	
073917	they shouted
073918	
073919	in the Lycaonian language,
073920	
073921	
073922	“The gods
073923	in
073924	human form!”
073925	have come down
073926	to us
073927	
073928	They began to call
073929	
073930	
073931	Barnabas
073932	Zeus
073933	
073934	and
073935	Paul
073936	Hermes,
073937	because
073938	
073939	he was
073940	
073941	the chief
073942	
073943	speaker.
073944	
073945	
073946	The priest
073947	
073948	of the temple of Zeus,
073949	
073950	located
073951	just outside
073952	
073953	the city,
073954	bulls
073955	
073956	and garlands
073957	to
073958	
073959	the city gates;
073960	brought
073961	
073962	
073963	he and the crowds
073964	wanted
073965	to offer sacrifices to them.
073966	heard
073967	But
073968	
073969	when the apostles
073970	Barnabas
073971	
073972	and Paul
073973	about it, they tore
073974	
073975	their clothes
073976	
073977	and rushed out
073978	into
073979	
073980	the crowd,
073981	shouting,
073982	
073983	
073984	“Men,
073985	why
073986	
073987	are you doing
073988	
073989	
073990	with human natures just like
073991	these things? We too are
073992	
073993	men,
073994	you! We are proclaiming the good news to you,
073995	
073996	from
073997	
073998	
073999	these worthless things
074000	so that you should turn
074001	to
074002	God,
074003	the living
074004	who
074005	made
074006	
074007	the heaven,
074008	
074009	
074010	the earth,
074011	
074012	
074013	the sea,
074014	
074015	and everything
074016	
074017	that is in them.
074018	
074019	
074020	In
074021	
074022	past
074023	generations
074024	he allowed
074025	all
074026	
074027	the nations
074028	to go
074029	
074030	their own ways,
074031	
074032	yet
074033	he did not
074034	without a witness
074035	
074036	leave himself
074037	by doing good,
074038	from heaven
074039	
074040	rain
074041	by giving you
074042	
074043	seasons,
074044	and fruitful
074045	satisfying you
074046	with food
074047	
074048	with joy.”
074049	
074050	and your hearts
074051	
074052	
074053	
074054	Even by saying
074055	these things, they scarcely
074056	persuaded
074057	
074058	the crowds
074059	
074060	not
074061	to offer sacrifice to them.
074062	
074063	came
074064	But
074065	from
074066	Antioch
074067	
074068	and Iconium,
074069	Jews
074070	
074071	and after winning
074072	
074073	the crowds over,
074074	
074075	they stoned
074076	
074077	Paul
074078	and dragged him
074079	out of
074080	
074081	the city,
074082	presuming him
074083	
074084	to be dead.
074085	had surrounded him,
074086	But
074087	
074088	after the disciples
074089	
074090	he got up
074091	and went back
074092	into
074093	
074094	the city.
074095	
074096	
074097	On the next day
074098	he left
074099	with
074100	
074101	Barnabas
074102	for
074103	Derbe.
074104	After they had proclaimed the good news
074105	
074106	
074107	city
074108	in that
074109	
074110	and made
074111	many disciples,
074112	they returned
074113	to
074114	
074115	Lystra,
074116	
074117	to
074118	Iconium,
074119	
074120	and to
074121	Antioch.
074122	They strengthened
074123	
074124	the souls
074125	
074126	of the disciples
074127	and encouraged
074128	them to continue
074129	
074130	in the faith,
074131	
074132	
074133	through
074134	many
074135	persecutions.”
074136	saying, “We must
074137	
074138	enter
074139	
074140	
074141	the kingdom
074142	
074143	of God
074144	When they had appointed
074145	
074146	
074147	in the various
074148	churches,
074149	elders for them
074150	prayer
074151	with
074152	and fasting
074153	they entrusted them
074154	
074155	
074156	to the protection of the Lord
074157	in
074158	whom
074159	they had believed.
074160	
074161	Then they passed through
074162	
074163	Pisidia
074164	and came
074165	into
074166	
074167	Pamphylia,
074168	
074169	and when they had spoken
074170	in
074171	Perga,
074172	
074173	the word
074174	they went down
074175	to
074176	Attalia.
074177	From there
074178	they sailed back
074179	to
074180	Antioch,
074181	where
074182	they had been
074183	commended
074184	to
074185	the grace
074186	
074187	of God
074188	for
074189	
074190	the work
074191	
074192	they had now completed.
074193	When they arrived
074194	
074195	
074196	and gathered
074197	
074198	the church together,
074199	they reported
074200	all the things
074201	had done
074202	
074203	God
074204	with them,
074205	
074206	
074207	
074208	and that he had opened
074209	
074210	for the Gentiles.
074211	a door
074212	of faith
074213	they spent
074214	So
074215	time
074216	
074217	considerable
074218	with
074219	
074220	the disciples.
074221	
074222	Now some men
074223	came down
074224	from
074225	
074226	Judea
074227	and began to teach
074228	
074229	the brothers,
074230	
074231	
074232	“Unless
074233	you are circumcised
074234	
074235	according to the custom
074236	
074237	of Moses,
074238	
074239	you cannot
074240	be saved.”
074241	had
074242	
074243	argument
074244	
074245	and debate
074246	
074247	a major
074248	
074249	When Paul
074250	
074251	
074252	and Barnabas
074253	with them,
074254	
074255	the church appointed
074256	to go up
074257	Paul
074258	
074259	and Barnabas
074260	
074261	and some
074262	others
074263	from among them
074264	
074265	to
074266	
074267	meet with the apostles
074268	
074269	and elders
074270	in
074271	Jerusalem
074272	about
074273	
074274	this point of disagreement.
074275	
074276	
074277	
074278	So
074279	they were sent on their way
074280	by
074281	
074282	the church,
074283	and as they passed through
074284	
074285	both
074286	Phoenicia
074287	
074288	and Samaria,
074289	they were relating at length
074290	
074291	the conversion
074292	
074293	of the Gentiles
074294	
074295	and bringing
074296	joy
074297	great
074298	to all
074299	
074300	the brothers.
074301	When they arrived
074302	
074303	in
074304	Jerusalem,
074305	they were received
074306	by
074307	
074308	the church
074309	
074310	
074311	and the apostles
074312	
074313	
074314	and the elders,
074315	and they reported
074316	
074317	all the things
074318	
074319	God
074320	had done
074321	with them.
074322	
074323	stood up
074324	But
074325	some
074326	
074327	from
074328	
074329	the religious party
074330	
074331	of the Pharisees
074332	who had believed
074333	and said,
074334	
074335	“It is necessary
074336	to circumcise
074337	
074338	to order
074339	the Gentiles and
074340	them to observe
074341	
074342	the law
074343	of Moses.”
074344	met together
074345	Both
074346	
074347	the apostles
074348	
074349	
074350	and the elders
074351	to deliberate
074352	about
074353	
074354	this matter.
074355	
074356	much
074357	
074358	debate,
074359	After there had been
074360	stood up
074361	Peter
074362	and said
074363	to them,
074364	
074365	
074366	“Brothers,
074367	
074368	you know
074369	
074370	that some
074371	time
074372	ago
074373	
074374	
074375	chose me
074376	
074377	God
074378	
074379	
074380	to preach
074381	
074382	so they would hear
074383	
074384	to the Gentiles
074385	
074386	the message
074387	
074388	of the gospel
074389	
074390	and believe.
074391	
074392	
074393	who knows the heart,
074394	And God,
074395	has testified to them
074396	
074397	by giving
074398	
074399	Spirit
074400	
074401	them the Holy
074402	just as he did to us,
074403	
074404	
074405	
074406	and he made no
074407	distinction
074408	between them
074409	
074410	
074411	
074412	
074413	
074414	by faith.
074415	and us, cleansing
074416	
074417	their hearts
074418	
074419	now
074420	So
074421	why
074422	are you putting
074423	
074424	God to the test
074425	by placing
074426	a yoke
074427	on
074428	
074429	the neck
074430	
074431	of the disciples
074432	that
074433	neither
074434	
074435	our ancestors
074436	
074437	nor
074438	
074439	we have been able
074440	to bear?
074441	On the contrary,
074442	through
074443	
074444	the grace
074445	
074446	of the Lord
074447	Jesus,
074448	we believe
074449	that we are saved
074450	
074451	in the same
074452	way
074453	as they are.”
074454	kept quiet
074455	
074456	The whole
074457	
074458	group
074459	
074460	and listened
074461	to Barnabas
074462	
074463	and Paul
074464	while they explained
074465	all
074466	had done
074467	
074468	God
074469	the miraculous signs
074470	
074471	and wonders
074472	among
074473	
074474	the Gentiles
074475	through them.
074476	
074477	After
074478	
074479	
074480	they stopped speaking,
074481	
074482	replied,
074483	James
074484	
074485	
074486	“Brothers,
074487	listen to me.
074488	
074489	Simeon
074490	has explained
074491	how
074492	first
074493	
074494	God
074495	concerned
074496	himself to select
074497	from among
074498	the Gentiles
074499	a people
074500	
074501	for his name.
074502	
074503	
074504	
074505	agree with this,
074506	
074507	The words
074508	
074509	of the prophets
074510	as
074511	it is written,
074512	‘After
074513	
074514	this I will return,
074515	
074516	and I will rebuild
074517	
074518	tent
074519	of David;
074520	
074521	the fallen
074522	
074523	
074524	its ruins
074525	
074526	I will rebuild
074527	
074528	and restore it,
074529	
074530	so that
074531	
074532	may seek
074533	
074534	the rest
074535	
074536	of humanity
074537	
074538	the Lord,
074539	
074540	namely, all
074541	
074542	the Gentiles
074543	
074544	
074545	I have called
074546	
074547	to be my own,’
074548	
074549	
074550	
074551	says
074552	the Lord,
074553	who makes these things
074554	
074555	known
074556	from
074557	long ago.
074558	“Therefore
074559	
074560	I conclude
074561	that we should not
074562	cause extra difficulty
074563	
074564	for those among
074565	
074566	the Gentiles
074567	who are turning
074568	to
074569	
074570	God,
074571	but
074572	that we should write
074573	them a letter
074574	
074575	telling them to abstain
074576	
074577	from things defiled
074578	
074579	by idols
074580	
074581	
074582	and from sexual immorality
074583	
074584	
074585	and from what has been strangled

074587	
074588	and from blood.
074589	Moses
074590	For
074591	from
074592	times,
074593	ancient
074594	in every
074595	town

074597	had those who proclaim him

074600	aloud in
074601	
074602	the synagogues
074603	
074604	every
074605	Sabbath.”
074606	because he is read
074607	Then
074608	decided
074609	
074610	the apostles
074611	
074612	
074613	and elders,
074614	with
074615	the whole
074616	
074617	church,
074618	chosen
074619	men
074620	from among them,
074621	
074622	to send
074623	to
074624	Antioch
074625	with
074626	
074627	Paul
074628	
074629	and Barnabas.
074630	Judas
074631	
074632	called
074633	Barsabbas
074634	
074635	and Silas,
074636	
074637	leaders
074638	among
074639	
074640	the brothers,
074641	They sent this letter
074642	
074643	
074644	with them:
074645	
074646	From the apostles
074647	
074648	
074649	and elders,
074650	your brothers,
074651	
074652	in
074653	
074654	Antioch,
074655	
074656	Syria,
074657	
074658	and Cilicia,
074659	brothers and sisters
074660	
074661	
074662	to the Gentile
074663	greetings!
074664	Since
074665	we have heard
074666	
074667	that some
074668	from among us
074669	
074670	have gone out
074671	from us and have confused you,
074672	
074673	by what they said,
074674	upsetting
074675	
074676	your minds
074677	
074678	
074679	with no
074680	orders
074681	decided
074682	
074683	we have
074684	unanimously
074685	to choose
074686	men
074687	to send
074688	to you
074689	
074690	along with
074691	
074692	our dear friends
074693	
074694	Barnabas
074695	
074696	and Paul,
074697	
074698	who have risked
074699	
074700	their lives
074701	
074702	for
074703	
074704	the name
074705	
074706	of our Lord
074707	
074708	Jesus
074709	Christ.
074710	we are sending
074711	Therefore
074712	Judas
074713	
074714	and Silas
074715	
074716	
074717	you these things themselves in
074718	person.
074719	who will tell
074720	
074721	
074722	it seemed best
074723	For
074724	
074725	Spirit
074726	
074727	to the Holy
074728	and
074729	to us
074730	not
074731	any greater
074732	to place
074733	
074734	burden on you
074735	than
074736	
074737	
074738	these necessary rules:
074739	that you abstain from
074740	meat that has been sacrificed to idols
074741	
074742	and from blood
074743	
074744	and from what has been strangled
074745	
074746	and from sexual immorality.
074747	from
074748	doing these things,
074749	If you keep
074750	yourselves
074751	well.
074752	you will do
074753	Farewell.
074754	
074755	
074756	So
074757	when they were dismissed,
074758	they went down
074759	to
074760	Antioch,
074761	
074762	and after gathering
074763	
074764	the entire group together,
074765	they delivered
074766	
074767	the letter.
074768	When they read
074769	
074770	it aloud, the people rejoiced
074771	at
074772	
074773	its encouragement.
074774	Judas
074775	Both
074776	
074777	and Silas,
074778	
074779	
074780	prophets themselves,
074781	who were
074782	with
074783	speech.
074784	a long
074785	encouraged
074786	
074787	the brothers
074788	
074789	and strengthened
074790	After they had spent
074791	
074792	some time
074793	there, they were sent off
074794	in
074795	peace
074796	by
074797	
074798	the brothers
074799	to
074800	
074801	those who had sent them.
074802	
074803	Paul
074804	But
074805	
074806	and Barnabas
074807	remained
074808	in
074809	Antioch,
074810	teaching
074811	
074812	and proclaiming
074813	(along with
074814	
074815	others)
074816	many
074817	
074818	the word
074819	
074820	of the Lord.
074821	After
074822	
074823	some
074824	days
074825	said
074826	to
074827	Barnabas,
074828	Paul
074829	“Let’s return
074830	
074831	and visit
074832	
074833	the brothers
074834	in
074835	town
074836	every
074837	
074838	where
074839	we proclaimed
074840	
074841	the word
074842	
074843	of the Lord
074844	to see how
074845	they are doing.”
074846	Barnabas
074847	
074848	wanted
074849	to bring
074850	 too,
074851	
074852	John
074853	
074854	called
074855	Mark along with them
074856	Paul
074857	but
074858	insisted
074859	
074860	this one who had left them
074861	
074862	
074863	in
074864	Pamphylia
074865	
074866	that they should not
074867	accompanied them
074868	
074869	in
074870	
074871	the work.
074872	and had not
074873	take along
074874	
074875	They had
074876	
074877	a sharp disagreement,
074878	so that
074879	they parted company.
074880	
074881	
074882	
074883	
074884	
074885	Barnabas
074886	took along
074887	
074888	Mark
074889	and sailed away
074890	to
074891	Cyprus,
074892	Paul
074893	but
074894	chose
074895	Silas
074896	and set out,
074897	commended
074898	
074899	to the grace
074900	
074901	of the Lord
074902	by
074903	
074904	the brothers and sisters.
074905	He passed through
074906	
074907	
074908	Syria
074909	
074910	
074911	and Cilicia,
074912	strengthening
074913	
074914	the churches.
074915	He also came
074916	
074917	
074918	to
074919	Derbe
074920	
074921	and to
074922	Lystra.
074923	
074924	
074925	A disciple
074926	
074927	was
074928	there,
074929	named
074930	Timothy
074931	the son
074932	woman
074933	of a Jewish
074934	who was a believer,
074935	whose father
074936	but
074937	was a Greek.
074938	of him.
074939	spoke well
074940	
074941	
074942	in
074943	Lystra
074944	
074945	and Iconium
074946	The brothers
074947	
074948	wanted
074949	
074950	Paul
074951	Timothy to accompany him,
074952	
074953	
074954	
074955	and he took him
074956	and circumcised him
074957	
074958	because of
074959	
074960	the Jews
074961	
074962	who were
074963	in
074964	
074965	places,
074966	those
074967	knew
074968	for
074969	they all
074970	
074971	Greek.
074972	
074973	that his father
074974	
074975	was
074976	As
074977	
074978	they went through
074979	
074980	the towns,
074981	they passed on
074982	
074983	for the Gentile believers to obey.
074984	
074985	the decrees
074986	
074987	that had been decided on
074988	by
074989	
074990	the apostles
074991	
074992	and elders
074993	
074994	in
074995	Jerusalem
074996	
074997	
074998	So
074999	the churches
075000	were being strengthened
075001	
075002	in the faith
075003	
075004	and were increasing
075005	
075006	in number
075007	every
075008	day.
075009	They went through
075010	
075011	
075012	of Phrygia
075013	
075014	and Galatia,
075015	the region
075016	having been prevented
075017	by
075018	
075019	the Holy
075020	Spirit
075021	from speaking
075022	
075023	the message
075024	in
075025	
075026	the province of Asia.
075027	When they came
075028	
075029	to
075030	
075031	Mysia,
075032	they attempted
075033	into
075034	
075035	Bithynia,
075036	to go
075037	
075038	did not
075039	allow them to do this,
075040	
075041	
075042	but the Spirit
075043	of Jesus
075044	they passed through
075045	so
075046	
075047	Mysia
075048	and went down
075049	to
075050	Troas.
075051	
075052	A vision
075053	during
075054	
075055	the night:
075056	
075057	to Paul
075058	appeared
075059	man
075060	Macedonian

075063	standing
075064	
075065	there urging him,
075066	
075067	
075068	
075069	“Come over
075070	to
075071	Macedonia
075072	and help us!”
075073	
075074	After
075075	
075076	
075077	the vision,
075078	Paul saw
075079	immediately
075080	we attempted
075081	to go over
075082	to
075083	Macedonia,
075084	concluding
075085	
075086	had called us
075087	
075088	
075089	that God
075090	to proclaim the good news to them.
075091	
075092	We put out to sea
075093	
075094	from
075095	Troas
075096	and sailed a straight course
075097	to
075098	Samothrace,

075100	
075101	the next day
075102	to

075104	Neapolis,
075105	and from there
075106	to
075107	Philippi,
075108	which
075109	is
075110	a leading
075111	of that district
075112	
075113	of Macedonia,
075114	city
075115	a Roman colony.
075116	
075117	
075118	in
075119	
075120	
075121	this city
075122	We stayed
075123	days.
075124	for some
075125	
075126	
075127	day
075128	
075129	On the Sabbath
075130	we went
075131	outside
075132	
075133	the city gate
075134	to the side
075135	of the river,
075136	where
075137	we thought
075138	a place of prayer,
075139	there would be
075140	
075141	and we sat down
075142	and began to speak
075143	
075144	who had assembled there.
075145	to the women
075146	
075147	
075148	A woman
075149	named
075150	Lydia,
075151	a dealer in purple cloth
075152	from the city
075153	of Thyatira,
075154	fearing
075155	
075156	a God-
075157	woman, listened
075158	
075159	
075160	to us. The Lord
075161	opened
075162	
075163	her heart
075164	respond
075165	
075166	was saying.
075167	to
075168	
075169	to what Paul
075170	After
075171	
075172	were baptized,
075173	
075174	
075175	she and her household
075176	
075177	she urged
075178	
075179	us, “If
075180	you consider me
075181	
075182	a believer
075183	
075184	in the Lord,
075185	to be
075186	come
075187	in
075188	
075189	my house.”
075190	
075191	and stay
075192	
075193	And she persuaded us.
075194	
075195	
075196	Now
075197	as we were going
075198	
075199	to
075200	
075201	the place of prayer,
075202	a slave girl
075203	
075204	who had
075205	a spirit
075206	that enabled her to foretell the future by supernatural means.
075207	met us
075208	
075209	
075210	profit
075211	a great
075212	She brought
075213	
075214	her owners
075215	
075216	by fortune-telling.
075217	
075218	She followed behind
075219	
075220	Paul
075221	
075222	
075223	and us and kept crying out,
075224	
075225	
075226	
075227	“These men
075228	servants
075229	
075230	God,
075231	
075232	of the Most High
075233	are
075234	who
075235	are proclaiming to you
075236	
075237	the way
075238	of salvation.”
075239	
075240	
075241	She continued to do
075242	this for
075243	many
075244	days.
075245	became greatly annoyed,
075246	But
075247	Paul
075248	
075249	and turned
075250	
075251	to the spirit,
075252	and said
075253	“I command you
075254	
075255	in
075256	the name
075257	of Jesus
075258	Christ
075259	to come out
075260	of her!”
075261	
075262	
075263	And it came out of her
075264	
075265	
075266	at once.
075267	saw
075268	But
075269	
075270	when her owners
075271	
075272	
075273	was gone,
075274	
075275	their hope
075276	
075277	of profit
075278	
075279	they seized
075280	
075281	Paul
075282	
075283	
075284	and Silas
075285	and dragged
075286	them into
075287	
075288	the marketplace
075289	before
075290	
075291	the authorities.
075292	
075293	When they had brought them
075294	
075295	
075296	before the magistrates,
075297	they said,
075298	
075299	
075300	“These men
075301	are throwing
075302	
075303	
075304	our city into confusion.
075305	Jews
075306	They are
075307	
075308	and are advocating
075309	customs
075310	that
075311	are not
075312	lawful for us
075313	
075314	to accept
075315	or
075316	practice,
075317	Romans.”
075318	since we are
075319	
075320	joined the attack
075321	
075322	The crowd
075323	against them,

075326	
075327	and the magistrates
075328	tore
075329	off Paul and Silas
075330	
075331	the clothes
075332	and ordered
075333	them to be beaten with rods.
075334	severely,
075335	
075336	
075337	
075338	After they had beaten them
075339	they threw them
075340	into
075341	prison
075342	and commanded
075343	
075344	the jailer
075345	securely.
075346	to guard them
075347	
075348	
075349	orders,
075350	such
075351	Receiving
075352	he threw them
075353	
075354	in

075356	the inner
075357	cell
075358

075361	and fastened
075362	
075363	in
075364	
075365	the stocks.
075366	About
075367	and
075368	
075369	midnight
075370	Paul
075371	
075372	Silas
075373	were praying
075374	and singing hymns
075375	
075376	to God,
075377	were listening to them.
075378	and
075379	
075380	
075381	the rest of the prisoners
075382	Suddenly
075383	
075384	earthquake
075385	occurred,

075399	
075400	of all
075401	
075402	and the bonds
075403	the prisoners came loose.
075404	woke up
075405	
075406	
075407	
075408	When the jailer
075409	
075410	and saw
075411	standing open,
075412	
075413	the doors
075414	
075415	of the prison
075416	he drew
075417	
075418	his sword
075419	and was about
075420	himself,
075421	to kill
075422	because he assumed
075423	had escaped.
075424	
075425	the prisoners
075426	called out
075427	But
075428	
075429	Paul
075430	loudly,
075431	
075432	
075433	“Do not

075435	yourself,
075436	harm
075437	all
075438	for
075439	we are
075440	here!”
075441	Calling
075442	
075443	for lights,
075444	the jailer rushed in
075445	
075446	trembling
075447	
075448	and fell down
075449	
075450	at the feet of Paul
075451	
075452	
075453	and Silas.
075454	
075455	Then he brought them
075456	
075457	outside
075458	and asked,
075459	“Sirs,
075460	what
075461	
075462	must
075463	I do
075464	to
075465	be saved?”
075466	
075467	
075468	They replied,
075469	“Believe
075470	in
075471	
075472	the Lord
075473	Jesus
075474	
075475	and you will be saved,
075476	
075477	
075478	
075479	you and your household.”
075480	
075481	
075482	Then they spoke
075483	to him,
075484	
075485	the word
075486	
075487	of the Lord
075488	along with
075489	all
075490	
075491	those who were in
075492	
075493	his house.
075494	
075495	
075496	he took them
075497	
075498	At
075499	that
075500	
075501	hour
075502	
075503	of the night
075504	and washed
075505	
075506	
075507	their wounds;

075509	his family were baptized
075510	
075511	
075512	
075513	
075514	then he and all
075515	right away.
075516	The jailer brought them
075517	
075518	
075519	into
075520	
075521	his house
075522	and set
075523	food before them,
075524	
075525	and he rejoiced greatly
075526	together with his entire household.
075527	that he had come to believe

075535	the magistrates
075536	
075537	their police officers,
075538	saying,
075539	“Release
075540	
075541	men.”
075542	those
075543	reported
075544	
075545	
075546	The jailer
075547	
075548	these words

075561	come out
075562	and go
075563	in
075564	peace.”
075565	
075566	But
075567	Paul
075568	said
075569	to
075570	
075571	the police officers, “They had us beaten
075572	
075573	in public
075574	without a proper trial –
075575	
075576	Roman citizens –
075577	even though we are
075578	and they threw us
075579	in
075580	prison.
075581	
075582	And now
075583	secretly?

075600	these words
075601	
075602	They were frightened
075603	
075604	when they heard
075605	
075606	Roman citizens
075607	Paul and Silas were
075608	
075609	and came
075610	and apologized to them.
075611	
075612	
075613	After they brought them out,
075614	they asked
075615	them repeatedly to leave
075616	
075617	
075618	the city.
075619	When they came out
075620

075624	they entered

075634	them and then departed.
075635	After they traveled through

075668	explaining
075669	
075670	and demonstrating
075671	
075672	
075673	that the Christ

075832	for they
075833	received
075834	
075835	the message,
075836	
075837	
075838	eagerly
075839	every
075840	day
075841	examining
075842	
075843	the scriptures carefully
075844	to see if
075845	these things were
075846	
075847	so.
075848	many
075849	
075850	Therefore
075851	of them

075862	along with quite
075863	a few
075864	when
075865	But
075866	heard

075868	from

075872	
075873	
075874	in
075875	
075876	Berea,
075877	had also proclaimed
075878	
075879	
075880	that Paul

075882	the word
075883	
075884	of God
075885	they came
075886	there too,
075887	inciting
075888	
075889	and disturbing
075890	
075891	the crowds.
075892	at once,
075893	
075894	Then
075895	
075896	Paul away
075897	sent
075898	
075899	the brothers
075900	
075901	
075902	to
075903

075911	
075912	and Timothy
075913	in Berea.
075914	
075915	
075916	Those who accompanied
075917	
075918	Paul
075919	escorted
075920	him as far as
075921	Athens,
075922	
075923	and after receiving
075924	an order
075925	for
075926	
075927	Silas
075928	
075929	
075930	and Timothy
075931	to
075932	as
075933	soon as possible,
075934	come
075935	to him
075936	
075937	they left.
075938	in
075939	
075940	
075941	Athens,
075942	was waiting for them
075943	
075944	
075945	While Paul
075946	was greatly upset
075947	
075948	his spirit
075949	
075950	
075951	
075952	because he saw
075953	full of idols.
075954	was
075955	
075956	the city
075957	he was addressing
075958	
075959	So
075960	in
075961	
075962	the synagogue,
075963	
075964	the Jews
075965	
075966	
075967	and the God-fearing Gentiles
075968	
075969	and in
075970	
075971	the marketplace
075972	
075973	every
075974	day
075975	
075976	
075977	those who happened to be there.
075978	Also some
075979	
075980	
075981	
075982	of the Epicurean
075983	
075984	and Stoic
075985	philosophers
075986	were conversing with him,
075987	
075988	
075989	and some
075990	were asking,
075991	“What
075992	
075993	want
075994	
075995	does this foolish babbler
075996	
075997	to say?”
075998	
075999	
076000	of foreign
076001	gods.”
076002	Others said, “He seems
076003	a proclaimer
076004	to be
076005	(They said this because
076006	
076007	about Jesus
076008	
076009	
076010	and the resurrection.)
076011	he was proclaiming the good news
076012	they took
076013	So
076014	
076015	
076016	
076017	him to the Areopagus,
076018	
076019	Paul and brought
076020	saying,
076021	“May
076022	we know
076023	what
076024	
076025	this new
076026	
076027	
076028	
076029	
076030	is that you are proclaiming?
076031	teaching
076032	surprising things
076033	For
076034	some
076035	you are bringing
076036	to
076037	
076038	our ears,
076039	
076040	we want
076041	so
076042	to know
076043	what
076044	
076045	
076046	they mean.”
076047	the Athenians
076048	
076049	(All
076050	
076051	
076052	who lived there
076053	and the foreigners
076054	in
076055	nothing
076056	else
076057	used to spend their time
076058	than
076059	telling
076060	to something
076061	or
076062	listening
076063	
076064	new.)
076065	stood
076066	So
076067	
076068	Paul
076069	
076070	before
076071	
076072	the Areopagus
076073	
076074	and said,
076075	“Men
076076	of Athens,
076077	in
076078	all respects.
076079	
076080	are very religious
076081	
076082	I see that you
076083	as I went around
076084	For
076085	
076086	and observed closely
076087	
076088	your objects of worship,
076089	
076090	I even found
076091	
076092	an altar
076093	with
076094	this
076095	inscription:
076096	‘To an unknown
076097	god.’
076098	what
076099	Therefore
076100	without knowing
076101	you worship
076102	
076103	
076104	it, this I proclaim to you.
076105	
076106	
076107	The God
076108	
076109	who made
076110	
076111	the world
076112	
076113	and everything
076114	
076115	in
076116	
076117	
076118	of heaven
076119	
076120	and earth,
076121	it, who is
076122	Lord
076123	does not
076124	in
076125	made by human hands,
076126	temples
076127	live
076128	nor
076129	by
076130	hands,
076131	human
076132	is he served
076133	as if he needed
076134	anything, because he himself
076135	
076136	gives
076137	and everything
076138	life
076139	
076140	and breath
076141	
076142	
076143	to everyone.
076144	he made
076145	
076146	From
076147	one man
076148	every
076149	nation
076150	of the human race
076151	to inhabit
076152	
076153	the entire
076154	
076155	
076156	earth,
076157	determining
076158	their set
076159	times
076160	
076161	
076162	and the fixed limits
076163	
076164	of the places where they would live,
076165	
076166	so that they would search
076167	
076168	for God
076169	
076170	and perhaps
076171	him, though
076172	grope around for him
076173	
076174	
076175	and find
076176	
076177	
076178	not
076179	far
076180	from
076181	one of us.
076182	each
076183	
076184	he is
076185	in him
076186	
076187	For
076188	we live
076189	
076190	and move about
076191	
076192	and exist,
076193	as
076194	
076195	even some
076196	
076197	
076198	
076199	of your own poets
076200	have said,
076201	
076202	‘For
076203	
076204	his offspring.’
076205	we too are
076206	offspring,
076207	So
076208	since we are
076209	
076210	God’s
076211	not
076212	we should
076213	think
076214	gold
076215	or
076216	silver
076217	or
076218	stone,
076219	an image
076220	skill
076221	
076222	and imagination.
076223	made by human
076224	
076225	the deity
076226	is
076227	like
076228	
076229	
076230	Therefore,
076231	such times
076232	
076233	of ignorance,
076234	has overlooked
076235	
076236	although God
076237	
076238	he now
076239	commands
076240	
076241	people
076242	all
076243	everywhere
076244	to repent,
076245	because
076246	he has set
076247	a day
076248	on
076249	which
076250	he is going to
076251	judge
076252	
076253	the world
076254	in
076255	righteousness,
076256	by
076257	a man
076258	whom
076259	he designated,
076260	proof
076261	having provided
076262	to everyone
076263	by raising him
076264	
076265	from
076266	the dead.”
076267	when they heard
076268	Now
076269	about the resurrection
076270	from the dead,
076271	
076272	
076273	some began to scoff,
076274	
076275	but
076276	others said,
076277	“We will hear you
076278	
076279	about this.”
076280	
076281	
076282	again
076283	So
076284	
076285	Paul
076286	left
076287	
076288	
076289	the Areopagus.
076290	some
076291	But
076292	people
076293	joined him
076294	
076295	and believed.
076296	Among
076297	them
076298	
076299	were Dionysius,
076300	
076301	who was a member of the Areopagus,
076302	
076303	a woman
076304	named
076305	Damaris,
076306	
076307	and others
076308	with them.
076309	
076310	After
076311	
076312	this Paul departed
076313	from
076314	
076315	Athens
076316	and went
076317	to
076318	Corinth.
076319	
076320	There he found
076321	
076322	a Jew
076323	named
076324	Aquila,
076325	of Pontus,
076326	
076327	a native
076328	who had recently
076329	come
076330	from
076331	
076332	Italy
076333	
076334	Priscilla,
076335	with his wife
076336	
076337	because
076338	
076339	had ordered
076340	Claudius
076341	to depart
076342	all
076343	
076344	the Jews
076345	from
076346	
076347	Rome.
076348	Paul approached them,
076349	
076350	
076351	and because
076352	
076353	he worked at the same trade,
076354	they were
076355	he stayed
076356	with them
076357	
076358	
076359	and worked
076360	
076361	with them (for
076362	tentmakers
076363	
076364	by trade).
076365	He addressed
076366	
076367	in
076368	
076369	the synagogue
076370	
076371	every
076372	Sabbath,
076373	attempting to persuade them.
076374	both
076375	Jews
076376	
076377	and Greeks
076378	when
076379	Now
076380	arrived
076381	from
076382	
076383	Macedonia,
076384	
076385	
076386	Silas
076387	
076388	
076389	and Timothy
076390	became wholly absorbed
076391	
076392	with proclaiming the word,
076393	
076394	Paul
076395	testifying
076396	
076397	to the Jews
076398	was
076399	
076400	the Christ.
076401	that Jesus
076402	When they opposed
076403	
076404	
076405	
076406	him and reviled
076407	him, he protested by shaking out
076408	
076409	his clothes
076410	and said
076411	to them,
076412	
076413	
076414	“Your blood
076415	
076416	be on
076417	
076418	your own heads!
076419	
076420	I am guiltless!
076421	
076422	From
076423	
076424	now
076425	to
076426	
076427	the Gentiles!”
076428	on I will go
076429	
076430	Then Paul left
076431	
076432	the synagogue and went to
076433	
076434	the house
076435	of a person
076436	named
076437	Titius
076438	Justus,
076439	a Gentile who worshiped
076440	
076441	God,
076442	whose
076443	
076444	house
076445	was
076446	next door
076447	
076448	to the synagogue.
076449	Crispus,
076450	
076451	
076452	the president of the synagogue,
076453	believed
076454	
076455	in the Lord
076456	together with
076457	his entire
076458	
076459	household,
076460	
076461	
076462	and many
076463	
076464	of the Corinthians
076465	who heard
076466	about it believed
076467	
076468	and were baptized.
076469	said
076470	
076471	
076472	The Lord
076473	in
076474	the night,
076475	by
076476	a vision
076477	
076478	to Paul
076479	“Do not
076480	be afraid,
076481	but
076482	speak
076483	
076484	and do not
076485	be silent,
076486	because
076487	
076488	I am
076489	with you,
076490	
076491	
076492	and no one
076493	will assault
076494	
076495	
076496	you to harm you,
076497	
076498	because
076499	people
076500	I have
076501	
076502	many
076503	in
076504	
076505	this city.”
076506	
076507	he stayed
076508	So
076509	there a year
076510	
076511	months,
076512	and six
076513	teaching
076514	among them.
076515	
076516	
076517	the word
076518	
076519	of God
076520	while Gallio
076521	Now
076522	proconsul
076523	was
076524	
076525	of Achaia,
076526	attacked
076527	together
076528	
076529	the Jews
076530	
076531	Paul
076532	
076533	and brought him
076534	
076535	before
076536	
076537	the judgment seat,
076538	saying,
076539	
076540	in a way contrary

076543	“This man is persuading

076545	
076546	people
076547	to worship

076549	God
076550	was about
076551	But
076552	
076553	just as Paul
076554	
076555	
076556	to speak,
076557	said
076558	
076559	Gallio
076560	to
076561	
076562	the Jews,
076563	“If
076564	
076565	it were
076566	crime
076567	a matter of some
076568	or
076569	piece of villainy,
076570	serious
076571	
076572	Jews,
076573	in accepting
076574	the complaint of you
076575	
076576	I would have been justified
076577	
076578	since
076579	but
076580	points of disagreement
076581	it concerns
076582	about
076583	words
076584	
076585	and names
076586	
076587	and your own law,
076588	
076589	
076590	
076591	settle
076592	
076593	a judge of these things!”
076594	
076595	
076596	not

076601	
076602	from
076603	
076604	the judgment seat.
076605	seized
076606	So
076607	they all
076608	Sosthenes,
076609	
076610	the president of the synagogue,
076611	and began to beat
076612	him in front of
076613	
076614	the judgment seat.
076615	
076616	Yet none
076617	
076618	
076619	to Gallio.
076620	of these things were of any concern
076621	
076622	
076623	Paul,
076624	more
076625	after staying
076626	days
076627	many
076628	
076629	to the brothers
076630	in Corinth, said farewell
076631	and sailed away
076632	to
076633	
076634	Syria
076635	
076636	accompanied by
076637	
076638	Priscilla
076639	
076640	and Aquila.
076641	He had his hair cut off
076642	at
076643	Cenchrea
076644	
076645	
076646	he had
076647	because
076648	made a vow.
076649	When they reached
076650	
076651	
076652	Ephesus,
076653	Priscilla and Aquila
076654	Paul left
076655	behind there,
076656	
076657	but he himself
076658	went
076659	into
076660	
076661	the synagogue
076662	and addressed
076663	
076664	the Jews.
076665	When they asked
076666	
076667	
076668	
076669	longer,
076670	
076671	him to stay
076672	he would not
076673	consent,
076674	but
076675	said farewell
076676	
076677	to them and added,
076678	again
076679	“I will come back
076680	to you
076681	
076682	
076683	if God
076684	wills.”
076685	Then he set sail
076686	from
076687	
076688	Ephesus,
076689	
076690	and when he arrived
076691	at
076692	Caesarea,
076693	he went up
076694	
076695	and greeted
076696	
076697	the church
076698	at Jerusalem and then went down
076699	to
076700	Antioch.
076701	
076702	After he spent
076703	time
076704	some
076705	there, Paul left
076706	and went through
076707	
076708	
076709	of Galatia
076710	the region
076711	
076712	and Phrygia,
076713	strengthening
076714	all
076715	
076716	the disciples.
076717	a Jew
076718	Now
076719	
076720	Apollos,
076721	named
076722	of Alexandria,
076723	
076724	a native
076725	speaker,
076726	an eloquent
076727	arrived
076728	in
076729	Ephesus.
076730	well-versed
076731	He was
076732	in
076733	
076734	the scriptures.
076735	
076736	He had been
076737	instructed
076738	
076739	in the way
076740	
076741	of the Lord,
076742	
076743	
076744	
076745	and with great enthusiasm
076746	he spoke
076747	
076748	and taught
076749	accurately
076750	
076751	the facts about
076752	
076753	Jesus,
076754	although he knew
076755	only
076756	
076757	the baptism
076758	of John.
076759	
076760	
076761	He began
076762	to speak out fearlessly
076763	in
076764	
076765	the synagogue,
076766	heard him,
076767	but
076768	
076769	when Priscilla
076770	
076771	and Aquila
076772	they took
076773	him aside
076774	
076775	more accurately.
076776	
076777	and explained
076778	
076779	the way
076780	
076781	of God to him
076782	When Apollos wanted
076783	
076784	
076785	to cross over
076786	to
076787	
076788	Achaia,
076789	encouraged
076790	
076791	the brothers
076792	him and wrote
076793	
076794	to the disciples
076795	to welcome him.
076796	
076797	When he
076798	arrived,
076799	he assisted
076800	greatly
076801	
076802	those who had believed
076803	by
076804	
076805	grace,
076806	he refuted
076807	for
076808	
076809	the Jews
076810	vigorously
076811	in public debate,
076812	demonstrating
076813	from
076814	
076815	the scriptures
076816	was
076817	
076818	that the Christ
076819	Jesus.
076820	
076821	
076822	While
076823	
076824	
076825	Apollos
076826	was
076827	in
076828	Corinth,
076829	Paul
076830	went through
076831	
076832	the inland
076833	regions
076834	and came
076835	to
076836	Ephesus.
076837	
076838	He found
076839	some
076840	disciples there
076841	said
076842	and
076843	to them,
076844	
076845	
076846	Spirit
076847	the Holy
076848	“Did you receive
076849	when you believed?”
076850	
076851	
076852	
076853	
076854	They replied, “No,
076855	we have not even
076856	
076857	Spirit.”
076858	a Holy
076859	that there is
076860	heard
076861	Paul said,
076862	So
076863	“Into
076864	what
076865	then
076866	were you baptized?”
076867	
076868	
076869	they replied.
076870	“Into
076871	
076872	John’s
076873	baptism,”
076874	telling
076875	
076876	Paul
076877	“John
076878	baptized
076879	with a baptism
076880	of repentance,
076881	
076882	the people
076883	said,
076884	in
076885	
076886	the one who was to come
076887	after him,
076888	
076889	to
076890	believe
076891	
076892	that is,
076893	in
076894	
076895	Jesus.”
076896	When they heard
076897	
076898	this, they were baptized
076899	in
076900	
076901	the name
076902	
076903	of the Lord
076904	Jesus,
076905	
076906	placed
076907	
076908	
076909	and when Paul
076910	
076911	his hands on them,
076912	came
076913	
076914	Spirit
076915	
076916	the Holy
076917	upon them,
076918	
076919	and they began to speak
076920	
076921	in tongues
076922	
076923	and to prophesy.
076924	there were
076925	(Now
076926	
076927	in all.)
076928	men
076929	about
076930	twelve
076931	Paul entered
076932	So
076933	
076934	
076935	the synagogue
076936	and spoke out fearlessly
076937	for
076938	months,
076939	three
076940	addressing
076941	
076942	and convincing
076943	
076944	them about
076945	
076946	the kingdom
076947	
076948	of God.
076949	when
076950	But
076951	some
076952	were stubborn
076953	
076954	and refused to believe,
076955	reviling
076956	
076957	the Way
076958	before
076959	
076960	the congregation,
076961	he left them
076962	
076963	
076964	and took
076965	
076966	the disciples
076967	them every
076968	day
076969	with him, addressing
076970	in
076971	
076972	the lecture hall
076973	of Tyrannus.
076974	
076975	
076976	This went on
076977	for
076978	years,
076979	two
076980	so that
076981	all
076982	
076983	who lived
076984	
076985	in the province of Asia,
076986	heard

077006	Paul’s
077007	so that
077008

077032	tried to invoke
077033	But
077034	some

077036	
077037	itinerant
077038	Jewish
077039	exorcists
077040	
077041	over
077042	
077043	those who were possessed

077056	
077057	by Jesus
077058	whom
077059	Paul
077060	preaches.”
077061	
077062	(Now
077063	of a man
077064	named Sceva,
077065	a Jewish
077066	high priest,
077067	seven
077068	sons

077082	“I know
077083	
077084	
077085	with Paul,
077086	and I am acquainted
077087

077089	who
077090	are you?”
077091	
077092	jumped
077093	
077094	Then the man
077095	on them
077096	
077097	
077098	who
077099	was possessed

077102	
077103	by the evil
077104	and beat
077105	them all into submission.
077106	He prevailed
077107	against them
077108	
077109	so that

077125	
077126	and Greeks;
077127	
077128	who lived
077129	
077130	in Ephesus,
077131	
077132	came

077134	over them
077135	all,
077136	
077137	
077138	was praised.
077139	
077140	and the name
077141	
077142	of the Lord
077143	Jesus
077144	Many
077145	
077146	
077147	of those who had believed
077148	came forward,
077149	confessing
077150	
077151	and making
077152	
077153	their deeds known.
077154

077157	
077158	
077159	magic
077160	of those who had practiced

077162	
077163	their books
077164	and burned them up
077165	in the presence of
077166	everyone.
077167	
077168	was added up,
077169	
077170	When the value
077171	of the books
077172	
077173	it was found
077174	silver coins.

077180	
077181	of the Lord
077182	
077183	the word
077184	continued to grow
077185	
077186	and to prevail.
077187	
077188	Now
077189	after all these things had taken place,
077190	
077191	
077192	
077193	Paul
077194

077201	and Achaia.
077202	to go
077203	to
077204	Jerusalem,
077205	He said,

077420	
077421	
077422	and most
077423	of them did not
077424	know
077425	
077426	why
077427	they had met together.
077428	Some of

077431	the crowd
077432	concluded
077433	it was about Alexander
077434	had pushed him

077436	
077437	because the Jews

077441	gesturing
077442	
077443	with his hand,
077444	was wanting
077445	to make a defense
077446	
077447	before the public assembly.
077448	when they recognized
077449	But
077450	
077451	a Jew,

077461	two
077462	shouted in unison,
077463	“Great
077464	
077465	is Artemis
077466	of the Ephesians!”
077467	quieted
077468	
077469	
077470	After the city secretary
077471	
077472	the crowd,
077473	he said,
077474	“Men
077475	of Ephesus,
077476	what
077477	
077478	is
077479	person

077484	of the Ephesians
077485	that the city
077486	the keeper of the temple
077487	is
077488	
077489	of the great
077490	Artemis
077491	
077492	
077493	and of her image that fell from heaven?
077494	indisputable,
077495	So
077496	because these facts are
077497	
077498	you must
077499	
077500	
077501	keep quiet
077502	
077503	
077504	and not
077505	reckless.
077506	do anything
077507	you have brought
077508	For
077509	
077510	these men
077511	
077512	here who are neither
077513	temple robbers
077514	nor
077515	blasphemers
077516	
077517	of our goddess.
077518	
077519	If
077520	
077521	then
077522	Demetrius
077523	
077524	
077525	who are with him
077526	
077527	and the craftsmen
077528	have
077529	against
077530	someone,
077531	a complaint
077532	the courts
077533	are open
077534	
077535	proconsuls;
077536	and there are
077537	let them bring charges against
077538	one another there.
077539	if
077540	But
077541	anything
077542	in addition,
077543	you want
077544	
077545	
077546	in a legal
077547	assembly.
077548	it will have to be settled
077549	
077550	For
077551	we are in danger
077552	of being charged
077553	with rioting
077554	
077555	
077556	today,
077557	no
077558	cause
077559	since there is
077560	
077561	
077562	
077563	we can
077564	give
077565	to explain
077566	
077567	
077568	this disorderly gathering.”
077569	
077570	
077571	
077572	After he had said this,
077573	he dismissed
077574	
077575	the assembly.
077576	After
077577	
077578	
077579	had ended,
077580	
077581	the disturbance
077582	sent for
077583	
077584	Paul
077585	
077586	the disciples,
077587	
077588	and after encouraging
077589	them and saying farewell,
077590	he left
077591	to go
077592	to
077593	Macedonia.
077594	After he had gone through
077595	
077596	
077597	regions
077598	those
077599	
077600	and spoken
077601	to the believers there,
077602	words of encouragement

077609	
077610	months.
077611	for three
077612	where he stayed
077613	a plot against him
077614	
077615	
077616	
077617	Because the Jews
077618	as he was intending
077619	to sail
077620	for
077621	
077622	Syria,
077623	
077624	he decided
077625	
077626	to return
077627	through
077628	Macedonia.
077629	Paul was accompanied

077691	
077692	Paul
077693	began to speak
077694	
077695	to the people, and because he intended
077696	to leave

077949	and faith
077950	in
077951	
077952	our Lord
077953	
077954	Jesus.
077955	
077956	And now,
077957	
077958	compelled
077959	
077960	
077961	by the Spirit,
077962	I am going
077963	to
077964	Jerusalem
077965	
077966	
077967	there,
077968	what will happen to me
077969	
077970	without
077971	knowing
077972	except
077973	
077974	
077975	Spirit
077976	
077977	that the Holy
077978	in
077979	town after town
077980	warns me
077981	
077982	
077983	
077984	that imprisonment
077985	
077986	and persecutions
077987	
077988	are waiting for me.
077989	But
077990	not
077991	consider
077992	I do
077993	
077994	my life
077995	worth anything
077996	to myself,
077997	so that
077998	I may finish
077999	
078000	my task
078001	
078002	
078003	
078004	and the ministry
078005	that
078006	I received
078007	from
078008	
078009	the Lord
078010	Jesus,
078011	to testify
078012	
078013	to the good news
078014	
078015	grace.
078016	
078017	of God’s
078018	
078019	“And now
078020	
078021	
078022	I know
078023	
078024	that none of you
078025	will see
078026	
078027	
078028	me again.
078029	
078030	
078031	among
078032	whom
078033	I went around
078034	proclaiming
078035	
078036	the kingdom
078037	Therefore
078038	I declare to you
078039	
078040	
078041	
078042	
078043	today
078044	
078045	innocent
078046	that I am
078047	of
078048	
078049	the blood
078050	of you all.
078051	I did not
078052	For
078053	hold back
078054	
078055	
078056	from announcing to you
078057	the whole
078058	
078059	purpose
078060	
078061	of God.
078062	
078063	Watch out
078064	for yourselves
078065	
078066	and for all
078067	
078068	the flock
078069	of
078070	which
078071	
078072	
078073	Spirit
078074	
078075	the Holy
078076	has made you
078077	overseers,
078078	to shepherd
078079	
078080	the church
078081	
078082	of God
078083	that
078084	he obtained
078085	with
078086	
078087	the blood
078088	
078089	of his own Son.
078090	
078091	I know
078092	
078093	will come in
078094	that after
078095	
078096	I am gone
078097	
078098	wolves
078099	fierce
078100	among you,
078101	
078102	not
078103	sparing
078104	
078105	the flock.
078106	
078107	Even from among
078108	
078109	
078110	will arise,
078111	your own group men
078112	teaching
078113	perversions of the truth
078114	
078115	to draw
078116	
078117	the disciples away
078118	after them.
078119	
078120	Therefore
078121	be alert,
078122	remembering
078123	that
078124	for three years
078125	night
078126	
078127	and day
078128	I did not
078129	stop
078130	of you with
078131	tears.
078132	warning
078133	one
078134	each
078135	
078136	
078137	And now
078138	I entrust you
078139	
078140	
078141	to God
078142	
078143	
078144	and to the message
078145	
078146	of his grace.
078147	
078148	
078149	This message is able
078150	to build
078151	
078152	and give
078153	you up
078154	you an inheritance
078155	among
078156	
078157	those who are sanctified.
078158	all
078159	silver
078160	or
078161	gold
078162	or
078163	clothing.
078164	no one’s
078165	I have desired
078166	yourselves know
078167	You
078168	that
078169	
078170	my needs
078171	
078172	
078173	
078174	and the needs of those who were
078175	with me.
078176	
078177	of mine provided for
078178	
078179	these hands
078180	
078181	By all these things,
078182	I have shown
078183	
078184	
078185	in this way
078186	you that by working
078187	we must
078188	help
078189	
078190	the weak,
078191	remember
078192	and
078193	
078194	the words
078195	
078196	of the Lord
078197	Jesus
078198	
078199	
078200	that he himself said,
078201	blessed
078202	‘It is
078203	more
078204	to give
078205	than
078206	to receive.’”
078207	
078208	
078209	When he had said
078210	
078211	
078212	these things, he knelt down
078213	
078214	with them
078215	all
078216	
078217	and prayed.
078218	loudly,
078219	
078220	to weep
078221	began
078222	They all
078223	
078224	
078225	
078226	
078227	and hugged
078228	
078229	Paul
078230	and kissed him,
078231	
078232	saddened
078233	especially
078234	by
078235	
078236	what
078237	
078238	he had said,
078239	
078240	that they were not
078241	going to
078242	
078243	
078244	him again.
078245	see
078246	they accompanied him
078247	Then
078248	
078249	to
078250	
078251	the ship.
078252	After
078253	
078254	
078255	we put out to sea,
078256	
078257	we tore ourselves away
078258	from them,
078259	
078260	and sailing a straight course,
078261	we came
078262	to
078263	
078264	Cos,
078265	
078266	
078267	on the next day
078268	to
078269	
078270	Rhodes,
078271	and from there
078272	to
078273	Patara.
078274	
078275	We found
078276	a ship
078277	crossing over
078278	to
078279	Phoenicia,
078280	went aboard,
078281	and put out to sea.
078282	After we sighted
078283	
078284	
078285	Cyprus
078286	
078287	and left
078288	it behind
078289	on our port side,
078290	we sailed on
078291	to
078292	Syria
078293	
078294	and put in
078295	at
078296	Tyre,
078297	
078298	because
078299	
078300	the ship
078301	was
078302	to unload
078303	
078304	its cargo there.
078305	After we located
078306	
078307	
078308	the disciples,
078309	we stayed
078310	there
078311	days.
078312	seven
078313	They
078314	
078315	Paul
078316	repeatedly told
078317	through
078318	
078319	the Spirit
078320	not
078321	to set foot
078322	in
078323	Jerusalem.
078324	When
078325	
078326	was
078327	
078328	over,
078329	
078330	our time
078331	we left
078332	and went on
078333	our way.
078334	
078335	All
078336	of them, with
078337	their wives
078338	
078339	and children,
078340	
078341	accompanied us outside
078342	
078343	of the city.
078344	
078345	
078346	
078347	After kneeling down
078348	on
078349	
078350	the beach
078351	and praying,
078352	we said farewell
078353	to one another.
078354	
078355	Then we went aboard
078356	to
078357	
078358	the ship,
078359	they
078360	and
078361	returned
078362	
078363	
078364	their own homes.
078365	
078366	
078367	
078368	the voyage
078369	We continued
078370	from
078371	Tyre
078372	and arrived
078373	at
078374	Ptolemais,
078375	
078376	and when we had greeted
078377	
078378	the brothers,
078379	we stayed
078380	day.
078381	for one
078382	with them
078383	
078384	
078385	
078386	On the next day
078387	we left
078388	and came
078389	to
078390	Caesarea,
078391	
078392	and entered
078393	
078394	
078395	the house
078396	of Philip
078397	
078398	the evangelist,
078399	who was
078400	one of
078401	
078402	the seven,
078403	and stayed
078404	with him.
078405	
078406	
078407	
078408	(He had
078409	daughters
078410	four
078411	unmarried
078412	who prophesied.)
078413	While we remained
078414	
078415	of days,
078416	there for a number
078417	came down
078418	
078419	from
078420	
078421	Judea.
078422	a prophet
078423	named
078424	Agabus
078425	
078426	He came
078427	to us,
078428	
078429	
078430	took
078431	
078432	belt,
078433	
078434	Paul’s
078435	tied
078436	his own
078437	
078438	and feet
078439	
078440	
078441	hands
078442	says
078443	this:
078444	with it, and said,
078445	
078446	Spirit
078447	
078448	“The Holy
078449	
078450	the man
078451	whose
078452	this is,
078453	
078454	belt
078455	
078456	‘This is the way
078457	will tie up
078458	in
078459	Jerusalem
078460	
078461	the Jews
078462	
078463	and will hand him over
078464	to
078465	
078466	the Gentiles.’”
078467	When
078468	
078469	we heard this,
078470	
078471	begged him
078472	
078473	both
078474	
078475	
078476	we and the local people
078477	
078478	not
078479	to go up
078480	
078481	to
078482	Jerusalem.
078483	Then
078484	replied,
078485	
078486	Paul
078487	“What
078488	are you doing,
078489	weeping
078490	
078491	and breaking
078492	
078493	
078494	my heart?
078495	
078496	For
078497	not
078498	only
078499	to be tied up,
078500	but
078501	
078502	even to die
078503	in
078504	Jerusalem
078505	ready
078506	I am
078507	for
078508	
078509	the name
078510	
078511	of the Lord
078512	Jesus.”
078513	Because he could not
078514	be persuaded,
078515	
078516	
078517	we said no more
078518	
078519	
078520	except, “The Lord’s
078521	
078522	will
078523	be done.”
078524	After
078525	
078526	
078527	these days
078528	
078529	we got ready
078530	and started up
078531	to
078532	Jerusalem.
078533	came along
078534	
078535	
078536	
078537	Some of the disciples
078538	from
078539	Caesarea
078540	with us
078541	
078542	too, and brought us
078543	with
078544	whom
078545	we were to stay.
078546	to the house of Mnason
078547	
078548	of Cyprus,
078549	from the earliest times,
078550	a disciple
078551	When we arrived
078552	
078553	
078554	in
078555	Jerusalem,
078556	gladly.
078557	welcomed us
078558	
078559	
078560	the brothers
078561	
078562	
078563	The next day
078564	went in
078565	
078566	Paul
078567	with us
078568	
078569	to
078570	see James,
078571	all
078572	and
078573	were there.
078574	
078575	the elders
078576	
078577	When Paul had greeted them,
078578	
078579	he began to explain
078580	in
078581	detail
078582	
078583	what
078584	had done
078585	
078586	God
078587	among
078588	
078589	the Gentiles
078590	through
078591	
078592	his ministry.
078593	
078594	
078595	
078596	When they heard
078597	this, they praised
078598	
078599	God.
078600	they said to him,
078601	Then
078602	
078603	“You see,
078604	brother,
078605	how many
078606	thousands
078607	
078608	
078609	
078610	of Jews
078611	
078612	there are who have believed,
078613	
078614	all
078615	ardent observers
078616	
078617	of the law.
078618	and they are
078619	They have been informed
078620	
078621	about
078622	
078623	
078624	to abandon
078625	you – that you teach
078626	
078627	Moses,
078628	
078629	
078630	
078631	now living among the Gentiles
078632	all
078633	the Jews
078634	telling
078635	them not
078636	to circumcise
078637	
078638	
078639	their children
078640	or
078641	
078642	according to our customs.
078643	live
078644	What
078645	then
078646	
078647	should we do? They will no doubt
078648	hear
078649	
078650	that you have come.
078651	
078652	So
078653	do
078654	what
078655	
078656	we tell
078657	you: We have
078658	
078659	men
078660	four
078661	taken a vow;
078662	who have
078663	
078664	
078665	
078666	take
078667	them and purify
078668	yourself along with them
078669	
078670	
078671	and pay
078672	
078673	their expenses,
078674	so that
078675	shaved.
078676	
078677	they may have their heads
078678	
078679	will know
078680	Then everyone
078681	
078682	in what
078683	they have been told
078684	about you,
078685	
078686	nothing
078687	there is
078688	but
078689	that you yourself live
078690	
078691	
078692	in conformity
078693	
078694	with the law.
078695	regarding
078696	But
078697	
078698	who have believed,
078699	the Gentiles
078700	
078701	we have written a letter,
078702	having decided
078703	that they should avoid
078704	
078705	
078706	
078707	meat that has been sacrificed to idols
078708	
078709	and blood
078710	
078711	and what has been strangled
078712	
078713	and sexual immorality.”
078714	Then
078715	
078716	Paul
078717	took
078718	
078719	the men
078720	
078721	the next
078722	day,
078723	himself along with them,
078724	
078725	and after he had purified
078726	he went
078727	to
078728	
078729	the temple
078730	and gave notice
078731	
078732	of the completion
078733	
078734	of the days
078735	
078736	of purification,
078737	
078738	when
078739	would be offered
078740	for
078741	
078742	each of them.
078743	
078744	
078745	the sacrifice
078746	When
078747	
078748	
078749	
078750	the seven
078751	days
078752	were almost over,
078753	
078754	from
078755	
078756	the province of Asia
078757	the Jews
078758	who had seen him
078759	
078760	in
078761	
078762	the temple area
078763	stirred up
078764	the whole
078765	
078766	crowd
078767	
078768	
078769	
078770	
078771	
078772	and seized him,
078773	shouting,
078774	“Men
078775	of Israel,
078776	help!
078777	
078778	This is
078779	
078780	the man
078781	
078782	against
078783	
078784	our people,
078785	Furthermore
078786	
078787	our law,
078788	
078789	
078790	and this sanctuary!
078791	
078792	everyone
078793	everywhere
078794	who teaches
078795	
078796	
078797	
078798	Greeks
078799	he has brought
078800	into
078801	
078802	the inner courts of the temple
078803	and made
078804	ritually unclean!”
078805	
078806	this holy
078807	place
078808	
078809	they had
078810	(For
078811	seen
078812	Trophimus
078813	
078814	the Ephesian
078815	in
078816	
078817	the city
078818	with him
078819	
078820	
078821	previously, and they assumed
078822	
078823	into
078824	
078825	the inner temple courts.)
078826	had brought him
078827	
078828	Paul
078829	was stirred up,
078830	
078831	
078832	city
078833	The whole
078834	
078835	
078836	rushed together.
078837	
078838	and the people
078839	
078840	They seized
078841	
078842	Paul
078843	and dragged him
078844	
078845	out
078846	
078847	of the temple courts,
078848	
078849	and immediately
078850	were shut.
078851	
078852	the doors
078853	While they were trying
078854	
078855	
078856	to kill him,
078857	was sent up
078858	a report
078859	
078860	to the commanding officer
078861	
078862	of the cohort
078863	
078864	that all
078865	was in confusion.
078866	Jerusalem
078867	He
078868	immediately
078869	took
078870	soldiers
078871	
078872	and centurions
078873	and ran down
078874	to
078875	
078876	
078877	
078878	the crowd. When they saw
078879	
078880	the commanding officer
078881	
078882	
078883	and the soldiers,
078884	they stopped
078885	beating
078886	
078887	Paul.
078888	Then
078889	came up
078890	
078891	the commanding officer
078892	and arrested him
078893	
078894	
078895	and ordered him
078896	to be tied up
078897	chains;
078898	with two
078899	
078900	he then asked
078901	who
078902	he was
078903	
078904	and what
078905	
078906	he had done.
078907	some
078908	But
078909	and others something else,
078910	one thing,
078911	shouted
078912	in
078913	
078914	
078915	the crowd
078916	and when the commanding officer was unable
078917	
078918	
078919	to find out
078920	
078921	the truth
078922	because of
078923	
078924	the disturbance,
078925	he ordered
078926	Paul to be brought
078927	
078928	into
078929	
078930	the barracks.
078931	When
078932	
078933	he came
078934	to
078935	
078936	the steps,
078937	Paul had
078938	to be carried
078939	
078940	by
078941	
078942	the soldiers
078943	because of
078944	
078945	the violence
078946	
078947	of the mob,
078948	followed
078949	for
078950	
078951	a crowd
078952	
078953	of people
078954	them, screaming,
078955	“Away with him!”
078956	
078957	was about to
078958	
078959	be brought
078960	into
078961	
078962	the barracks,
078963	
078964	As Paul
078965	he said
078966	
078967	to the commanding officer,
078968	
078969	“May
078970	
078971	I say
078972	something
078973	to
078974	
078975	
078976	
078977	you?” The officer replied,
078978	Greek?
078979	“Do you know
078980	not
078981	Then
078982	
078983	you’re
078984	
078985	that Egyptian
078986	
078987	ago?”
078988	
078989	
078990	some time
078991	who started a rebellion
078992	
078993	and led
078994	into
078995	
078996	the wilderness
078997	
078998	the four thousand
078999	men
079000	
079001	of the ‘Assassins’
079002	answered,
079003	
079004	
079005	Paul
079006	
079007	
079008	
079009	“I am
079010	a Jew
079011	from Tarsus
079012	
079013	in Cilicia,
079014	
079015	of an important
079016	city.
079017	a citizen
079018	Please
079019	
079020	
079021	allow me
079022	
079023	to speak
079024	to
079025	
079026	the people.”
079027	When the commanding officer had given
079028	
079029	him permission,
079030	
079031	Paul
079032	stood
079033	on
079034	
079035	the steps
079036	and gestured
079037	
079038	with his hand.
079039	
079040	to the people
079041	
079042	
079043	silent,
079044	When they had become
079045	he addressed
079046	
079047	them in Aramaic,
079048	
079049	
079050	
079051	“Brothers
079052	
079053	and fathers,
079054	listen
079055	
079056	
079057	make to you.”
079058	
079059	that I now
079060	to my defense
079061	(When they heard
079062	
079063	
079064	
079065	in Aramaic,
079066	
079067	that he was addressing them
079068	
079069	even
079070	they became
079071	quieter.)
079072	
079073	Then Paul said,
079074	
079075	“I am
079076	
079077	a Jew,
079078	born
079079	in
079080	Tarsus
079081	
079082	in Cilicia,
079083	brought up
079084	but
079085	in
079086	
079087	this city,
079088	
079089	under
079090	
079091	
079092	Gamaliel
079093	educated
079094	with
079095	strictness
079096	
079097	of our ancestors,
079098	according to the law
079099	zealous
079100	and was
079101	
079102	for God
079103	just as
079104	all
079105	
079106	of you are
079107	today.
079108	
079109	
079110	
079111	this Way
079112	I persecuted
079113	even to the point of
079114	death,
079115	tying up
079116	
079117	and putting
079118	them in
079119	prison,
079120	men
079121	both
079122	
079123	and women
079124	as
079125	
079126	
079127	both the high priest
079128	can testify about me.
079129	
079130	
079131	and the whole
079132	
079133	council of elders
079134	From
079135	them
079136	
079137	letters
079138	I also received
079139	to
079140	
079141	the brothers
079142	in
079143	Damascus,
079144	and I was on my way
079145	to make arrests
079146	
079147	
079148	there
079149	
079150	and bring the prisoners
079151	to
079152	Jerusalem
079153	to
079154	be punished.
079155	I was en route
079156	
079157	
079158	As
079159	
079160	and near
079161	
079162	Damascus,
079163	about
079164	noon
079165	suddenly
079166	from
079167	
079168	heaven
079169	flashed
079170	light
079171	a very bright
079172	around me.
079173	
079174	I fell
079175	Then
079176	to
079177	
079178	the ground
079179	
079180	and heard
079181	a voice
079182	saying to me,
079183	
079184	‘Saul,
079185	Saul,
079186	why
079187	
079188	are you persecuting me?’
079189	
079190	
079191	I answered,
079192	‘Who
079193	are you,
079194	Lord?’
079195	He said
079196	
079197	to me,
079198	
079199	
079200	‘I am
079201	Jesus
079202	
079203	the Nazarene,
079204	whom
079205	
079206	you are persecuting.’
079207	
079208	Those
079209	with me
079210	
079211	who were
079212	
079213	
079214	the light,
079215	saw
079216	
079217	but
079218	the voice
079219	did not
079220	understand
079221	
079222	of the one who was speaking to me.
079223	
079224	I asked,
079225	So
079226	‘What
079227	should I do,
079228	Lord?’
079229	
079230	
079231	The Lord
079232	said
079233	to me,
079234	
079235	‘Get up
079236	and go
079237	to
079238	Damascus;
079239	there
079240	
079241	you will be told
079242	about
079243	everything
079244	that
079245	you have been designated
079246	
079247	to do.’
079248	Since
079249	
079250	I could not
079251	see
079252	because of
079253	
079254	the brilliance
079255	
079256	light,
079257	of that
079258	led by the hand
079259	of
079260	
079261	those who were with me.
079262	
079263	I came
079264	to
079265	Damascus
079266	named Ananias,
079267	
079268	
079269	A man
079270	a devout man
079271	according to
079272	
079273	the law,
079274	well spoken
079275	of by
079276	all
079277	
079278	who live there,
079279	the Jews
079280	came
079281	to me
079282	
079283	
079284	and stood beside me
079285	and said to me,
079286	
079287	Saul,
079288	‘Brother
079289	regain your sight!’
079290	And
079291	at that very
079292	
079293	moment
079294	I looked up
079295	
079296	and saw him.
079297	
079298	Then
079299	he said,
079300	
079301	‘The God
079302	
079303	of our ancestors
079304	
079305	has already chosen
079306	
079307	you to know
079308	
079309	his will,
079310	
079311	
079312	to see
079313	
079314	the Righteous One,
079315	
079316	and to hear
079317	a command
079318	from
079319	
079320	his mouth,
079321	
079322	
079323	because you will be
079324	his witness
079325	
079326	to
079327	all
079328	people
079329	of what
079330	you have seen
079331	
079332	and heard.
079333	
079334	And now
079335	what
079336	are you waiting for?
079337	Get up,
079338	be baptized,
079339	
079340	washed away,
079341	
079342	and have your sins
079343	
079344	calling on
079345	
079346	his name.’
079347	
079348	I fell
079349	
079350	
079351	When I returned
079352	to
079353	Jerusalem
079354	
079355	and was praying
079356	
079357	in
079358	
079359	the temple,
079360	
079361	
079362	into
079363	a trance
079364	
079365	and saw
079366	
079367	the Lord saying to me,
079368	
079369	‘Hurry
079370	
079371	and get out
079372	
079373	quickly,
079374	of
079375	Jerusalem
079376	because
079377	they will not
079378	accept
079379	
079380	your testimony
079381	about me.’
079382	
079383	I
079384	replied,
079385	‘Lord, they themselves
079386	
079387	know
079388	
079389	
079390	
079391	that I imprisoned
079392	
079393	and beat
079394	those in the various
079395	
079396	synagogues
079397	
079398	who believed
079399	in you.
079400	
079401	
079402	And when
079403	was shed,
079404	
079405	the blood
079406	Stephen
079407	
079408	of your witness
079409	
079410	
079411	
079412	I myself was
079413	standing nearby,
079414	
079415	approving,
079416	
079417	and guarding
079418	
079419	the cloaks
079420	
079421	of those who were killing him.’
079422	
079423	
079424	Then he said
079425	away
079426	to me,
079427	‘Go,
079428	
079429	
079430	to
079431	the Gentiles.’”
079432	far
079433	because I will send you
079434	
079435	The crowd was listening to him
079436	
079437	
079438	until
079439	
079440	
079441	he said this.
079442	
079443	Then they raised
079444	
079445	their voices
079446	
079447	and shouted,
079448	“Away
079449	from
079450	
079451	the earth!
079452	
079453	with this man
079454	he should not
079455	For
079456	be allowed
079457	
079458	to live!”
079459	While they were screaming
079460	
079461	
079462	
079463	and throwing off
079464	
079465	their cloaks
079466	
079467	dust
079468	and tossing
079469	in
079470	
079471	the air,
079472	ordered
079473	
079474	the commanding officer
079475	Paul to be brought back
079476	
079477	into
079478	
079479	the barracks.
079480	He told
079481	Paul by beating
079482	them to interrogate
079483	him with a lash
079484	so that
079485	he could find out
079486	
079487	
079488	the reason
079489	at Paul in this way.
079490	the crowd was shouting
079491	
079492	When
079493	
079494	they had stretched
079495	him out
079496	
079497	for the lash,
079498	said
079499	to
079500	
079501	standing nearby,
079502	the centurion
079503	
079504	Paul
079505	
079506	a man
079507	who is a Roman citizen
079508	
079509	without a proper trial?”
079510	“Is it legal
079511	
079512	for you to lash
079513	heard
079514	
079515	
079516	When the centurion
079517	this, he went to
079518	
079519	the commanding officer
079520	and reported
079521	it, saying,
079522	“What
079523	are you about
079524	to do?
079525	
079526	For
079527	this man
079528	
079529	a Roman citizen.”
079530	is
079531	came
079532	So
079533	
079534	the commanding officer
079535	Paul, “Tell me,
079536	
079537	and asked
079538	
079539	
079540	are you a Roman citizen?”
079541	
079542	
079543	
079544	He replied,
079545	“Yes.”
079546	answered,
079547	
079548	
079549	The commanding officer
079550	
079551	with a large sum
079552	of money.”
079553	
079554	this citizenship
079555	
079556	“I acquired
079557	
079558	“But
079559	a citizen,” Paul
079560	replied.
079561	
079562	
079563	
079564	I was even born
079565	
079566	Then
079567	stayed away
079568	from him,
079569	
079570	
079571	those who were about
079572	
079573	to interrogate him
079574	
079575	
079576	and the commanding officer
079577	
079578	frightened
079579	when he realized
079580	that Paul was
079581	a Roman citizen
079582	was
079583	and
079584	that
079585	him
079586	he had had
079587	tied up.
079588	
079589	
079590	The next day,
079591	because the commanding officer wanted
079592	to know
079593	
079594	the true
079595	
079596	reason
079597	Paul was being accused
079598	by
079599	
079600	the Jews,
079601	he released him
079602	
079603	
079604	and ordered
079605	to assemble.
079606	
079607	the chief priests
079608	
079609	and the whole
079610	
079611	council
079612	
079613	He then brought
079614	
079615	Paul down
079616	and had him stand
079617	before them.
079618	
079619	looked directly
079620	
079621	
079622	Paul
079623	
079624	at the council
079625	and said,
079626	
079627	“Brothers,
079628	
079629	
079630	conscience
079631	with a clear
079632	I have lived my life
079633	
079634	before God
079635	to
079636	
079637	
079638	this day.”
079639	
079640	At that
079641	the high priest
079642	Ananias
079643	ordered
079644	
079645	those standing near
079646	
079647	Paul to strike him
079648	
079649	
079650	on the mouth.
079651	Then
079652	
079653	Paul
079654	to him,
079655	
079656	said
079657	to strike you,
079658	
079659	is going
079660	
079661	“God
079662	wall!
079663	you whitewashed
079664	
079665	
079666	Do you sit
079667	there judging me
079668	
079669	according to
079670	
079671	the law,
079672	
079673	and in violation of the law
079674	you order me
079675	
079676	to be struck?”
079677	
079678	
079679	Those standing near
079680	him said,
079681	
079682	high priest?”
079683	
079684	God’s
079685	“Do you dare insult
079686	replied,
079687	
079688	
079689	Paul
079690	“I did not
079691	realize,
079692	brothers,
079693	
079694	that he was
079695	the high priest,
079696	it is written,
079697	for
079698	
079699	about a ruler
079700	
079701	of your people.’”
079702	
079703	‘You must not
079704	speak
079705	evil
079706	noticed
079707	Then
079708	
079709	when Paul
079710	
079711	
079712	
079713	that part
079714	of them were
079715	Sadducees
079716	
079717	and
079718	the others
079719	Pharisees,
079720	he shouted out
079721	in
079722	
079723	the council,
079724	
079725	“Brothers,
079726	
079727	a Pharisee,
079728	I am
079729	a son
079730	of Pharisees.
079731	concerning
079732	the hope
079733	
079734	of the resurrection
079735	of the dead!”
079736	I am
079737	on trial
079738	this,
079739	When
079740	he
079741	said
079742	began
079743	an argument
079744	
079745	between the Pharisees
079746	
079747	and the Sadducees,
079748	
079749	was divided.
079750	
079751	and the assembly
079752	the Sadducees
079753	
079754	(For
079755	say
079756	no
079757	there is
079758	resurrection,
079759	or
079760	angel,
079761	or
079762	spirit,
079763	the Pharisees
079764	but
079765	acknowledge
079766	
079767	them all.)
079768	There was
079769	
079770	commotion,
079771	a great
079772	
079773	stood up
079774	and some
079775	
079776	experts in the law
079777	
079778	from the party
079779	
079780	of the Pharisees
079781	and protested strongly,
079782	
079783	nothing
079784	wrong
079785	“We find
079786	with
079787	
079788	this man.
079789	
079790	What if
079791	
079792	a spirit
079793	has spoken to him?”
079794	
079795	or
079796	an angel
079797	so great
079798	
079799	became
079800	When the argument
079801	feared
079802	
079803	
079804	the commanding officer
079805	that they would tear
079806	
079807	Paul to pieces,
079808	
079809	
079810	he ordered
079811	
079812	the detachment
079813	to go down,
079814	take
079815	him away
079816	from
079817	
079818	them by force,
079819	and bring him
079820	
079821	into
079822	
079823	the barracks.
079824	
079825	
079826	The following
079827	night
079828	stood near
079829	
079830	
079831	the Lord
079832	Paul and said,
079833	“Have courage,
079834	just as
079835	for
079836	you have testified
079837	
079838	about me
079839	
079840	in
079841	Jerusalem,
079842	so
079843	
079844	you must
079845	
079846	in
079847	Rome.”
079848	also testify
079849	came,
079850	
079851	When morning
079852	formed
079853	a conspiracy
079854	
079855	the Jews
079856	and bound
079857	themselves
079858	with an oath
079859	not
079860	to eat
079861	or
079862	drink
079863	anything until
079864	
079865	they had killed
079866	
079867	Paul.
079868	There were
079869	
079870	more
079871	than forty
079872	
079873	
079874	
079875	this conspiracy.
079876	of them who formed
079877	They
079878	went
079879	
079880	to the chief priests
079881	
079882	
079883	and the elders
079884	and said,
079885	with a solemn oath
079886	“We have bound
079887	ourselves
079888	not
079889	to partake
079890	of anything until
079891	
079892	we have killed
079893	
079894	Paul.
079895	now you
079896	So
079897	
079898	request
079899	
079900	the commanding officer
079901	and
079902	
079903	the council
079904	
079905	to bring
079906	him down
079907	to you,
079908	
079909	as
079910	if you were going
079911	by conducting a more thorough inquiry.
079912	to determine
079913	case

079915	his
079916	
079917	
079918	before
079919	
079920	he comes near this place.”
079921	
079922	ready
079923	We are
079924	
079925	to kill him
079926

079928	But
079929	
079930	when the son
079931	
079932	sister

079935	about the ambush,
079936	he came
079937	
079938	and entered
079939	
079940	
079941	the barracks
079942	and told
079943	
079944	Paul.
079945	called

079948	Paul
079949	one
079950	
079951	of the centurions
079952	and said,
079953	
079954	this young man
079955	
079956	“Take
079957	to
079958	
079959	the commanding officer,
079960	he has
079961	for

079963	something
079964	
079965	
079966	
079967	So
079968	the centurion took him
079969	
079970	and brought him
079971	to
079972	
079973	the commanding officer
079974	
079975	and said,
079976	
079977	“The prisoner
079978	Paul

079988	you because he has
079989	something
079990	to tell you.”
079991	
079992	took him
079993	
079994	
079995	by the hand,
079996	
079997	
079998	The commanding officer
079999	
080000	withdrew
080001	
080002	privately,
080003	and asked,
080004	“What
080005	is it
080006	that
080007	you want
080008	to report to me?”
080009	
080010	He replied,
080011	
080012	
080013	
080014	“The Jews
080015	have agreed
080016	
080017	to ask

080031	to inquire
080032	more thoroughly about him.
080033	
080034

080054	anything until
080055	
080056	they have killed him,
080057	
080058	
080059	and now
080060	they are
080061	ready,
080062	waiting
080063	
080064	for you
080065	
080066	to agree to their request.”
080067	
080068	
080069	Then
080070	the commanding officer
080071	sent
080072	
080073	the young man away,
080074	directing
080075	no one
080076	him, “Tell
080077	
080078	
080079	that you have reported
080080	these things to me.”
080081	
080082	
080083	Then he summoned
080084	two
080085	
080086	
080087	of the centurions
080088	and said,
080089	“Make ready
080090	soldiers
080091	two hundred
080092	
080093	to go
080094	to
080095	Caesarea
080096	
080097	horsemen
080098	along with seventy
080099	
080100	spearmen
080101	and two hundred
080102	by
080103	
080104	nine o’clock
080105	
080106	tonight,
080107	mounts
080108	and
080109	provide
080110	so that
080111	to ride
080112	
080113	for Paul
080114	he may be brought safely
080115	to
080116	Felix
080117	
080118	the governor.”
080119	He wrote
080120	a letter
080121	that went
080122	
080123	like this:
080124	
080125	Claudius
080126	Lysias
080127	
080128	to His Excellency
080129	Governor
080130	Felix,
080131	greetings.
080132	
080133	This man
080134	
080135	was seized
080136	by
080137	
080138	the Jews
080139	
080140	and they were about
080141	to kill him,
080142	
080143	
080144	when I came up
080145	with
080146	
080147	the detachment
080148	and rescued
080149	him, because I had learned
080150	
080151	a Roman citizen.
080152	that he was
080153	Since I wanted
080154	
080155	to know
080156	
080157	what charge
080158	
080159	
080160	they were accusing
080161	him of,
080162	I brought him down
080163	to
080164	
080165	their council.
080166	
080167	he
080168	I found
080169	was accused
080170	with reference to
080171	controversial questions
080172	
080173	about their law,
080174	
080175	no
080176	but
080177	against him deserved
080178	death
080179	or
080180	imprisonment.
080181	
080182	charge
080183	When I was informed
080184	
080185	
080186	a plot
080187	against
080188	
080189	this man,
080190	there would be
080191	at once,
080192	I sent
080193	him to you
080194	
080195	also ordering
080196	
080197	
080198	his accusers
080199	to state
080200	
080201	their charges against him
080202	
080203	before you.
080204	
080205	
080206	
080207	So
080208	the soldiers,
080209	in accordance with
080210	
080211	their orders,
080212	
080213	took
080214	
080215	Paul
080216	and brought
080217	during
080218	the night.
080219	him to
080220	
080221	Antipatris
080222	
080223	
080224	The next day
080225	they let
080226	
080227	the horsemen
080228	go on
080229	with him,
080230	
080231	and they returned
080232	to
080233	
080234	the barracks.
080235	When the horsemen
080236	came
080237	to
080238	
080239	Caesarea
080240	
080241	and delivered
080242	
080243	the letter
080244	
080245	to the governor,
080246	they also presented
080247	
080248	
080249	Paul to him.
080250	
080251	When the governor had read
080252	
080253	
080254	the letter, he asked
080255	
080256	what
080257	province
080258	he was
080259	
080260	from. When he learned
080261	
080262	that he was from
080263	Cilicia,
080264	“I will give
080265	you a hearing
080266	he said,
080267	when
080268	
080269	
080270	your accusers
080271	
080272	arrive
080273	too.” Then he ordered
080274	in
080275	
080276	palace.
080277	
080278	Herod’s
080279	that Paul be kept under guard
080280	
080281	After
080282	
080283	five
080284	days
080285	came down
080286	
080287	the high priest
080288	Ananias
080289	with
080290	elders
080291	some
080292	
080293	and an attorney
080294	named Tertullus,
080295	
080296	and they
080297	brought formal charges
080298	
080299	to the governor.
080300	against
080301	
080302	Paul
080303	When Paul had been summoned,
080304	
080305	
080306	began
080307	to accuse him,
080308	
080309	Tertullus
080310	saying,
080311	a lengthy time
080312	of peace
080313	“We have experienced
080314	through
080315	your rule,
080316	
080317	and reforms
080318	are being made
080319	
080320	in this nation
080321	
080322	through
080323	
080324	your
080325	foresight.
080326	in every way
080327	and
080328	
080329	this everywhere
080330	we acknowledge
080331	Most excellent
080332	Felix,
080333	with
080334	all
080335	gratitude.
080336	so that
080337	But
080338	I may not
080339	any
080340	further,
080341	
080342	delay you
080343	I beg
080344	you to hear us
080345	
080346	
080347	briefly
080348	
080349	with your
080350	customary graciousness.
080351	we have found
080352	For
080353	
080354	this man
080355	
080356	to be a troublemaker,
080357	
080358	one who stirs up
080359	riots
080360	among all
080361	
080362	the Jews
080363	
080364	throughout
080365	
080366	the world,
080367	a ringleader
080368	and
080369	
080370	
080371	of the Nazarenes.
080372	of the sect
080373	He
080374	
080375	
080376	the temple,
080377	even tried
080378	to desecrate
080379	him.
080380	
080381	so we arrested
080382	from
080383	him
080384	you will be able
080385	
080386	When you examine him yourself,
080387	about
080388	all
080389	
080390	to learn
080391	
080392	
080393	these things we are accusing him of doing.”
080394	
080395	also joined
080396	
080397	
080398	
080399	The Jews
080400	in the verbal attack, claiming
080401	
080402	true.
080403	that these things were
080404	replied,
080405	
080406	
080407	Paul
080408	gestured for him
080409	
080410	
080411	When the governor
080412	to speak,
080413	
080414	for many
080415	years,
080416	that you have been
080417	
080418	a judge
080419	
080420	over this nation
080421	
080422	“Because I know
080423	I confidently
080424	
080425	
080426	make my
080427	defense.
080428	As you can
080429	
080430	verify
080431	
080432	for yourself, not
080433	more
080434	
080435	
080436	days
080437	than twelve
080438	
080439	
080440	ago I went up
080441	to worship.
080442	to
080443	Jerusalem
080444	
080445	They did not
080446	in
080447	
080448	the temple courts
080449	find me
080450	
080451	with
080452	anyone
080453	arguing
080454	or
080455	
080456	stirring up
080457	a crowd
080458	or
080459	in
080460	
080461	the synagogues
080462	or
080463	throughout
080464	
080465	the city,
080466	nor
080467	they prove to you
080468	can
080469	
080470	the things
080471	
080472	
080473	they are accusing me of doing.
080474	
080475	I confess
080476	But
080477	
080478	
080479	
080480	according to
080481	
080482	the Way
080483	(which
080484	they call
080485	a sect),
080486	
080487	this to you, that I worship
080488	
080489	of our ancestors
080490	the God
080491	believing
080492	everything
080493	
080494	that is according to
080495	
080496	the law
080497	
080498	
080499	in
080500	
080501	the prophets.
080502	and that is written
080503	a hope
080504	I have
080505	in
080506	
080507	God
080508	(a hope that
080509	
080510	
080511	
080512	these men themselves accept
080513	a resurrection
080514	too) that there is going
080515	to be
080516	the righteous
080517	of both
080518	
080519	and the unrighteous.
080520	
080521	
080522	
080523	
080524	This is the reason I do my best
080525	a clear
080526	conscience
080527	have
080528	toward
080529	
080530	God
080531	
080532	
080533	and toward people.
080534	
080535	to always
080536	After
080537	years
080538	
080539	several
080540	gifts for the poor
080541	to bring
080542	to
080543	
080544	my people
080545	
080546	I came
080547	
080548	and to present offerings,
080549	in
080550	which
080551	I was doing when they found me
080552	
080553	ritually purified,
080554	
080555	
080556	the temple,
080557	
080558	without
080559	a crowd
080560	or
080561	
080562	a disturbance.
080563	there are some
080564	But
080565	from
080566	
080567	the province of Asia
080568	Jews
080569	who
080570	should
080571	before
080572	
080573	be here
080574	
080575	you and bring charges,
080576	if
080577	anything
080578	they have
080579	against me.
080580	
080581	Or
080582	
080583	
080584	these men here should tell
080585	what
080586	crime they found me
080587	guilty
080588	of when I stood
080589	
080590	before
080591	
080592	the council,
080593	other than
080594	concerning
080595	this one thing
080596	
080597	
080598	
080599	I shouted out
080600	before them:
080601	
080602	while I stood
080603	
080604	
080605	the resurrection
080606	of the dead.’”
080607	
080608	‘I am on trial
080609	today
080610	before you
080611	
080612	adjourned
080613	Then
080614	their hearing,
080615	
080616	Felix,
080617	more accurately,
080618	who understood
080619	
080620	the facts concerning
080621	
080622	the Way
080623	saying,
080624	“When
080625	Lysias
080626	
080627	the commanding officer
080628	comes down,
080629	I will decide your case.”
080630	
080631	
080632	
080633	He ordered
080634	
080635	the centurion
080636	to guard
080637	
080638	to let him have
080639	Paul, but
080640	some freedom,
080641	
080642	and not
080643	to prevent
080644	
080645	any of his friends
080646	
080647	from meeting
080648	his needs.
080649	later,
080650	
080651	days
080652	Some
080653	arrived
080654	
080655	when Felix
080656	with
080657	Drusilla,
080658	
080659	his
080660	wife
080661	who was
080662	Jewish,
080663	he sent for
080664	
080665	Paul
080666	
080667	and heard him
080668	
080669	speak about
080670	
080671	in
080672	Christ
080673	Jesus.
080674	faith
080675	While Paul was discussing
080676	
080677	
080678	
080679	righteousness,
080680	
080681	self-control,
080682	
080683	
080684	judgment,
080685	
080686	and the coming
080687	frightened
080688	became
080689	
080690	Felix
080691	and said,
080692	
080693	for now,
080694	when I have
080695	“Go away
080696	an opportunity,
080697	and
080698	
080699	I will send for you.”
080700	
080701	At the same time
080702	
080703	he was also hoping
080704	
080705	money,
080706	would give him
080707	
080708	
080709	
080710	that Paul
080711	and for this reason
080712	
080713	Paul as often as possible
080714	
080715	he sent for
080716	and talked with him.
080717	
080718	After two years
080719	
080720	had passed,
080721	
080722	succeeded
080723	
080724	Felix,
080725	Porcius
080726	Festus
080727	because he wanted
080728	and
080729	a favor,
080730	to do

080734	Felix
080735	left
080736	
080737	Paul
080738	in prison.
080739	Festus
080740	Now
080741	arrived
080742	
080743	in the province,
080744	after
080745	three
080746	days
080747	he went up
080748	to
080749	Jerusalem
080750	from
080751	Caesarea.
080752	brought formal charges
080753	So
080754	
080755	
080756	the chief priests
080757	
080758	
080759	and the most prominent men
080760	
080761	of the Jews
080762	against
080763	
080764	Paul to him.
080765	
080766	they urged Festus
080767	
080768	Requesting
080769	them a favor
080770	against
080771	Paul,
080772	
080773	to summon him
080774	
080775	to
080776	Jerusalem,
080777	planning an ambush
080778	him to do
080779	to kill him
080780	
080781	along
080782	
080783	the way.
080784	
080785	
080786	Then
080787	Festus
080788	replied
080789	was being kept
080790	
080791	that Paul
080792	at
080793	Caesarea,
080794	he himself
080795	and
080796	intended
080797	
080798	there shortly.
080799	to go
080800	
080801	“So,”
080802	
080803	
080804	he said,
080805	“let your leaders
080806	go down there with me,
080807	and if
080808	
080809	
080810	
080811	
080812	this man
080813	has done anything wrong,
080814	they may bring charges against him.”
080815	
080816	After Festus had stayed
080817	
080818	among them,
080819	
080820	days
080821	not
080822	more
080823	than eight
080824	or
080825	ten
080826	he went down
080827	to
080828	Caesarea,
080829	
080830	and the next day
080831	he sat
080832	on
080833	
080834	the judgment seat
080835	and ordered
080836	
080837	Paul
080838	to be brought.
080839	When he arrived,
080840	
080841	
080842	stood around him,
080843	
080844	
080845	from
080846	Jerusalem
080847	who had come down
080848	the Jews
080849	many
080850	
080851	serious
080852	charges
080853	bringing
080854	that
080855	they were not
080856	able
080857	to prove.
080858	
080859	Paul
080860	said in his defense,
080861	
080862	no
080863	offense against
080864	
080865	law
080866	
080867	the Jewish
080868	or
080869	against
080870	
080871	the temple
080872	or
080873	against
080874	Caesar.”
080875	
080876	“I have committed
080877	
080878	Festus,
080879	But
080880	wanting
080881	
080882	the Jews
080883	a favor,
080884	to do
080885	
080886	
080887	Paul,
080888	asked
080889	“Are you willing
080890	to
080891	Jerusalem
080892	go up to
080893	there
080894	on these charges?”
080895	
080896	and be tried
080897	before me
080898	
080899	replied,
080900	
080901	
080902	Paul
080903	before
080904	
080905	judgment seat,
080906	Caesar’s
080907	“I am standing
080908	
080909	where
080910	
080911	I should
080912	be tried.
080913	to the Jews,
080914	nothing wrong
080915	I have done
080916	as
080917	
080918	
080919	very well.
080920	you also know
080921	If
080922	
080923	then
080924	I am in the wrong
080925	
080926	that deserves
080927	death,
080928	and have done
080929	anything
080930	I am not
080931	trying to escape
080932	
080933	dying,
080934	if
080935	but
080936	not
080937	one
080938	
080939	
080940	of their charges against me
080941	
080942	is true, no one
080943	
080944	can
080945	over to them.
080946	hand me
080947	to Caesar!”
080948	I appeal
080949	Then,
080950	
080951	Festus
080952	after conferring
080953	with
080954	
080955	his council,
080956	replied,
080957	to Caesar;
080958	“You have appealed
080959	to
080960	Caesar
080961	you will go!”
080962	days
080963	
080964	had passed,
080965	After several
080966	Agrippa
080967	
080968	King
080969	
080970	and Bernice
080971	arrived
080972	at
080973	Caesarea
080974	to pay their respects
080975	
080976	to Festus.
080977	While
080978	
080979	many
080980	days,
080981	they were staying
080982	there
080983	
080984	Festus
080985	
080986	to the king
080987	explained
080988	
080989	case
080990	
080991	Paul’s
080992	to get his opinion, saying,
080993	a man
080994	
080995	“There is
080996	left
080997	by
080998	Felix.
080999	here as a prisoner
081000	
081001	
081002	When I was
081003	
081004	in
081005	Jerusalem,
081006	informed me about him,
081007	
081008	the chief priests
081009	
081010	
081011	and the elders
081012	
081013	of the Jews
081014	asking for
081015	against him.
081016	
081017	a sentence of condemnation
081018	
081019	
081020	I answered
081021	
081022	not
081023	them that it was
081024	the custom
081025	of the Romans
081026	to hand over
081027	anyone
081028	
081029	before
081030	
081031	
081032	the accused
081033	
081034	face to face
081035	had
081036	
081037	met his accusers
081038	and had been given an opportunity
081039	
081040	a defense
081041	to make
081042	against
081043	
081044	the accusation.
081045	after they came back
081046	So
081047	
081048	here
081049	postpone
081050	with me, I did not
081051	
081052	
081053	the case, but the next day
081054	I sat
081055	on
081056	
081057	the judgment seat
081058	and ordered
081059	to be brought.
081060	
081061	the man
081062	
081063	him with any
081064	stood up,
081065	
081066	When his accusers
081067	they did not
081068	charge
081069	
081070	
081071	
081072	I had suspected.
081073	of the evil deeds
081074	they had several points of disagreement
081075	Rather
081076	a man
081077	about
081078	
081079	their own
081080	religion
081081	
081082	with him
081083	
081084	
081085	and about
081086	
081087	named Jesus
081088	who was dead,
081089	whom
081090	claimed
081091	
081092	Paul
081093	to be alive.
081094	Because I was at a loss
081095	
081096	
081097	
081098	
081099	these matters,
081100	how I could investigate
081101	I asked
081102	if
081103	he were willing
081104	to go
081105	to
081106	Jerusalem
081107	and
081108	be tried there
081109	on these charges.
081110	on these charges.
081111	
081112	But
081113	when Paul
081114	appealed
081115	to be kept in custody
081116	
081117	
081118	
081119	
081120	of His Majesty the Emperor,
081121	for the decision
081122	I ordered him
081123	to be kept
081124	
081125	under guard until
081126	
081127	I could send him
081128	
081129	to
081130	Caesar.”
081131	Agrippa
081132	
081133	said to
081134	
081135	Festus,
081136	“I would
081137	
081138	
081139	
081140	the man
081141	also like to hear
081142	myself.” “Tomorrow,”
081143	he replied,
081144	“you will hear him.”
081145	
081146	
081147	So
081148	the next day
081149	came
081150	
081151	Agrippa
081152	
081153	
081154	and Bernice
081155	with
081156	great
081157	pomp
081158	
081159	and entered
081160	
081161	
081162	the audience hall,
081163	along with
081164	
081165	the senior military officers
081166	
081167	men
081168	
081169	
081170	and the prominent
081171	
081172	of the city.
081173	
081174	gave the order,
081175	
081176	When Festus
081177	was brought in.
081178	
081179	Paul
081180	
081181	said,
081182	
081183	Then Festus
081184	Agrippa,
081185	“King
081186	
081187	and all
081188	
081189	you who are present here with us,
081190	
081191	this man
081192	you see
081193	
081194	about
081195	whom
081196	the entire
081197	
081198	populace
081199	
081200	Jewish
081201	petitioned me
081202	
081203	in
081204	both
081205	Jerusalem
081206	
081207	and here,
081208	shouting loudly
081209	not
081210	that he ought
081211	
081212	to live
081213	any longer.
081214	
081215	But
081216	I found
081217	nothing
081218	that deserved
081219	
081220	death,
081221	that he had done
081222	
081223	and
081224	
081225	when he appealed
081226	
081227	to His Majesty the Emperor,
081228	I decided
081229	to send him.
081230	about
081231	him.
081232	definite
081233	
081234	to write
081235	
081236	to my lord
081237	nothing
081238	But I have
081239	Therefore
081240	I have brought him
081241	
081242	before you all,
081243	
081244	
081245	and especially
081246	before you,
081247	
081248	King
081249	Agrippa,
081250	so that
081251	
081252	after this preliminary
081253	
081254	hearing I may have
081255	something
081256	to write.
081257	unreasonable to me
081258	For
081259	
081260	it seems
081261	to send
081262	a prisoner
081263	without
081264	
081265	
081266	against him.”
081267	
081268	the charges
081269	clearly indicating
081270	Agrippa
081271	So
081272	to
081273	
081274	Paul,
081275	said
081276	“You have permission
081277	
081278	
081279	for yourself.”
081280	to speak
081281	Then
081282	
081283	Paul
081284	held out
081285	
081286	his hand
081287	and began his defense:
081288	“Regarding
081289	all the things
081290	
081291	I have been accused
081292	of by
081293	the Jews,
081294	King
081295	Agrippa,
081296	I consider
081297	myself
081298	fortunate
081299	before you
081300	
081301	that I am about
081302	today,
081303	to make my defense
081304	especially
081305	familiar
081306	because you are
081307	
081308	with all
081309	
081310	
081311	of the Jews.
081312	the customs
081313	
081314	
081315	and controversial issues
081316	Therefore
081317	I ask
081318	patiently.
081319	you to listen to me
081320	
081321	
081322	
081323	Now
081324	spending
081325	my life
081326	
081327	from
081328	my youth,
081329	
081330	from
081331	the beginning
081332	the way I lived
081333	among
081334	
081335	my own people
081336	
081337	in
081338	and
081339	Jerusalem.
081340	know
081341	all
081342	
081343	the Jews
081344	They know, because they have known me
081345	
081346	from time past,
081347	if
081348	they are willing
081349	to testify,
081350	
081351	that according to
081352	
081353	the strictest
081354	party
081355	
081356	of our
081357	religion,
081358	I lived
081359	as a Pharisee.
081360	
081361	And now
081362	because of
081363	my hope
081364	
081365	to
081366	
081367	our ancestors,
081368	
081369	in the promise
081370	
081371	made by
081372	
081373	God
081374	I stand
081375	here on trial
081376	
081377	this
081378	
081379	a promise that our twelve tribes
081380	
081381	
081382	as they earnestly
081383	God night
081384	
081385	and day.
081386	serve
081387	hope
081388	to attain
081389	Concerning
081390	
081391	hope
081392	are accusing
081393	
081394	the Jews
081395	me, Your Majesty!
081396	Why
081397	it is unbelievable
081398	do you people think
081399	
081400	
081401	that
081402	
081403	God
081404	the dead?
081405	raises
081406	
081407	
081408	Of course,
081409	was convinced
081410	I myself
081411	to
081412	
081413	the name
081414	of Jesus
081415	
081416	the Nazarene.
081417	that it was necessary
081418	many things
081419	hostile
081420	to do
081421	And that is what
081422	
081423	I did
081424	in
081425	Jerusalem:
081426	
081427	many
081428	but
081429	
081430	of the saints
081431	
081432	in
081433	prisons
081434	Not only did I lock up
081435	
081436	from
081437	
081438	the chief priests,
081439	by the authority
081440	I received
081441	when they were sentenced to death.
081442	
081443	
081444	I also cast
081445	my vote against them
081446	
081447	in
081448	all
081449	
081450	the synagogues
081451	often
081452	I punished them
081453	
081454	and tried to force them
081455	to blaspheme.
081456	Because I was so furiously
081457	
081458	enraged at them,
081459	
081460	I went to persecute
081461	
081462	
081463	them even in
081464	
081465	foreign
081466	cities.
081467	“While
081468	doing this very thing,
081469	as I was going
081470	to
081471	
081472	Damascus
081473	with
081474	authority
081475	
081476	and complete power
081477	
081478	
081479	from the chief priests,
081480	
081481	about noon
081482	along
081483	
081484	the road,
081485	I saw
081486	Your Majesty,
081487	from heaven,
081488	
081489	
081490	brighter
081491	
081492	than the sun,
081493	shining everywhere around me
081494	
081495	a light
081496	
081497	
081498	with me.
081499	
081500	and those traveling
081501	When we had all
081502	
081503	fallen
081504	
081505	to
081506	
081507	the ground,
081508	I heard
081509	a voice
081510	saying
081511	to me
081512	
081513	
081514	in Aramaic,
081515	
081516	‘Saul,
081517	Saul,
081518	why
081519	
081520	are you persecuting me?
081521	You are hurting
081522	
081523	against
081524	the goads.’
081525	yourself by kicking
081526	
081527	So
081528	I said,
081529	‘Who
081530	are
081531	you, Lord?’
081532	
081533	And
081534	the Lord
081535	replied,
081536	
081537	‘I am
081538	Jesus
081539	whom
081540	
081541	you are persecuting.
081542	But
081543	get up
081544	
081545	and stand
081546	on
081547	
081548	your feet,
081549	
081550	for this
081551	reason,
081552	for
081553	I have appeared to you
081554	
081555	to designate
081556	you in advance
081557	as a servant
081558	
081559	and witness
081560	to the things
081561	and
081562	you have seen
081563	
081564	to the things
081565	
081566	in which I will appear to you.
081567	
081568	I will rescue you
081569	
081570	from
081571	
081572	your own people
081573	
081574	and from
081575	
081576	the Gentiles,
081577	to
081578	whom
081579	
081580	I am sending you
081581	
081582	to open
081583	their eyes
081584	
081585	
081586	so that they turn
081587	from
081588	darkness
081589	to
081590	light
081591	
081592	and from
081593	the power
081594	
081595	of Satan
081596	to
081597	
081598	God,
081599	
081600	so that they may receive
081601	
081602	forgiveness
081603	of sins
081604	
081605	and a share
081606	among
081607	
081608	those who are sanctified
081609	by faith
081610	
081611	in me.’
081612	
081613	“Therefore,
081614	King
081615	Agrippa,
081616	not
081617	I was
081618	disobedient
081619	
081620	to the heavenly
081621	vision,
081622	but
081623	
081624	to those in
081625	Damascus
081626	first,
081627	and
081628	
081629	and then to those in Jerusalem

081635	Judea,
081636	
081637	
081638	and to the Gentiles,
081639	I declared
081640	that they should repent
081641	
081642	and turn
081643	to
081644	
081645	God,
081646	consistent
081647	
081648	with repentance.
081649	deeds
081650	performing
081651	For
081652	this reason
081653	
081654	the Jews,
081655	after they seized me
081656	while I was
081657	in
081658	
081659	the temple courts,
081660	were trying
081661	to kill me.
081662	help
081663	
081664	I have experienced
081665	
081666	from
081667	
081668	God
081669	
081670	
081671	to this day,
081672	
081673	and so I stand
081674	testifying
081675	small
081676	to both
081677	
081678	and great,
081679	nothing
081680	except
081681	saying
081682	what
081683	
081684	
081685	the prophets
081686	said
081687	was going
081688	to happen:
081689	
081690	and Moses
081691	that
081692	was to suffer
081693	
081694	the Christ
081695	
081696	and be the first
081697	from

081708	and to the Gentiles.”
081709	As Paul was saying these things
081710	
081711	
081712	in his defense,
081713	
081714	Festus
081715	loudly,
081716	
081717	
081718	exclaimed
081719	“You have lost your mind,
081720	Paul!

081722	Your great

081727	is driving you

081729	But
081730	Paul
081731	“I have not

081737	true

081751	freely
081752	these things, and I am speaking
081753	of these things has escaped his notice,
081754	because
081755	
081756	that any
081757	
081758	I cannot
081759	believe

081771	
081772	the prophets,

081775	that you believe.”
081776	
081777	
081778	Agrippa
081779	said to
081780	
081781	Paul,
081782	“In
081783	such a short time
081784	
081785	are you persuading me

081787	to become
081788	
081789	
081790	Paul
081791	replied, “I pray
081792	that whether

081808	those who are listening to me

081821	got up,
081822	So

081832	
081833	and those sitting with them,
081834	
081835	
081836	and as they were leaving
081837	they said
081838	to
081839	one another,
081840	
081841	
081842	is not

081846	deserving
081847	anything

081866	When
081867	
081868	it was decided
081869	
081870	we would sail
081871	
081872	to
081873	
081874	Italy,
081875	they handed over
081876	
081877	
081878	Paul
081879	
081880	and some
081881	other
081882	prisoners
081883	to a centurion
081884	named
081885	Julius.
081886	Cohort
081887	of the Augustan
081888	We went on board
081889	
081890	a ship
081891	from Adramyttium
081892	that was about
081893	to sail
081894	to
081895	
081896	along
081897	
081898	the coast of the province of Asia
081899	various ports
081900	and put out to sea,
081901	
081902	accompanied by
081903	
081904	Aristarchus,
081905	a Macedonian
081906	from Thessalonica.
081907	
081908	and
081909	The next day
081910	we put in
081911	at
081912	Sidon,
081913	kindly,
081914	
081915	
081916	Julius,
081917	
081918	Paul
081919	treating
081920	allowed
081921	him to
081922	
081923	to his friends
081924	go
081925	so they could provide
081926	him with what he needed.
081927	From there
081928	we put out to sea
081929	and sailed under the lee
081930	
081931	of Cyprus
081932	because
081933	
081934	
081935	the winds
081936	were
081937	against us.
081938	
081939	
081940	the open sea
081941	
081942	off
081943	
081944	Cilicia
081945	
081946	and Pamphylia,
081947	After we had sailed across
081948	we put in
081949	at
081950	Myra
081951	
081952	in Lycia.
081953	There
081954	found
081955	
081956	the centurion
081957	a ship
081958	from Alexandria
081959	sailing
081960	for
081961	
081962	Italy,
081963	and he put
081964	us
081965	aboard
081966	it.
081967	for
081968	many
081969	
081970	days
081971	We sailed slowly
081972	
081973	with difficulty
081974	and arrived
081975	off
081976	
081977	Cnidus.
081978	prevented us
081979	from going any farther,
081980	
081981	
081982	Because the wind
081983	we sailed under the lee
081984	
081985	of Crete
081986	off
081987	Salmone.
081988	With difficulty
081989	
081990	we sailed along the coast
081991	
081992	of Crete and came
081993	to
081994	a place
081995	
081996	called
081997	Fair
081998	Havens
081999	
082000	near
082001	the town
082002	that was
082003	of Lasea.
082004	Since considerable
082005	
082006	time
082007	had passed
082008	
082009	was
082010	now
082011	dangerous
082012	
082013	and the voyage
082014	because
082015	
082016	
082017	
082018	the fast
082019	was already
082020	over,
082021	advised them,
082022	
082023	Paul
082024	
082025	
082026	“Men,
082027	I can see
082028	
082029	in
082030	disaster
082031	
082032	and great
082033	loss
082034	not
082035	only
082036	
082037	of the cargo
082038	
082039	
082040	and the ship,
082041	but
082042	
082043	
082044	also of our lives.”
082045	
082046	is going
082047	to end
082048	
082049	the voyage
082050	
082051	But
082052	the centurion
082053	by
082054	the captain
082055	
082056	
082057	and the ship’s owner
082058	was more
082059	convinced
082060	than
082061	what
082062	by
082063	Paul
082064	said.
082065	not suitable
082066	
082067	
082068	Because the harbor
082069	was
082070	to
082071	spend the winter in,
082072	
082073	the majority
082074	to put out
082075	decided
082076	to sea
082077	from there.
082078	
082079	They hoped that somehow
082080	they could
082081	reach
082082	
082083	Phoenix,
082084	and spend the winter there.
082085	a harbor
082086	
082087	of Crete
082088	facing
082089	
082090	southwest
082091	
082092	
082093	and northwest,
082094	When a gentle
082095	
082096	south wind sprang up,
082097	they thought
082098	
082099	their purpose,
082100	they could carry out
082101	so they weighed anchor
082102	close along
082103	and sailed
082104	
082105	the coast of Crete.
082106	after
082107	Not
082108	long
082109	
082110	blew down
082111	from the island.
082112	
082113	wind
082114	this, a hurricane-force
082115	
082116	called
082117	the northeaster
082118	was caught
082119	
082120	
082121	When the ship
082122	
082123	not
082124	in it and could
082125	head
082126	
082127	into the wind,
082128	we gave way
082129	to it and were driven along.
082130	of a small island
082131	
082132	
082133	As we ran under the lee
082134	called
082135	Cauda,
082136	we were able
082137	with difficulty
082138	under control.
082139	to get
082140	
082141	the ship’s boat
082142	it
082143	After the crew had hoisted
082144	supports
082145	aboard, they used
082146	to undergird
082147	
082148	the ship.
082149	Fearing
082150	
082151	
082152	on
082153	
082154	the Syrtis,
082155	they would run aground
082156	they lowered
082157	
082158	the sea anchor,
082159	thus
082160	letting themselves be driven along.
082161	were violently
082162	
082163	battered by the storm,
082164	
082165	
082166	The next day, because we
082167	the cargo overboard,
082168	they began throwing
082169	
082170	
082171	and on the third day
082172	with their own hands.
082173	
082174	gear overboard
082175	
082176	the ship’s
082177	they threw
082178	When neither
082179	
082180	sun
082181	nor
082182	stars
082183	appeared
082184	for
082185	many
082186	days
082187	storm
082188	and
082189	
082190	a violent
082191	continued to batter us, we
082192	finally
082193	abandoned
082194	hope
082195	all
082196	
082197	of being saved.
082198	
082199	Since many
082200	thus
082201	no desire to eat,
082202	of them had
082203	
082204	stood up
082205	
082206	Paul
082207	
082208	among them
082209	
082210	and said,
082211	you should
082212	
082213	
082214	“Men,
082215	have listened to me
082216	
082217	and not
082218	put out to sea
082219	from
082220	
082221	Crete,
082222	avoiding
082223	
082224	
082225	this damage
082226	
082227	
082228	
082229	and loss.
082230	
082231	
082232	And now
082233	I advise
082234	
082235	you to keep up your courage,
082236	loss
082237	for
082238	of life
082239	no
082240	there will be
082241	among you,
082242	
082243	but only
082244	
082245	the ship will be lost.
082246	came to me
082247	For
082248	
082249	
082250	
082251	last night
082252	
082253	of the God
082254	to whom
082255	I belong
082256	
082257	and whom
082258	
082259	I serve
082260	an angel
082261	and said,
082262	‘Do not
082263	be afraid,
082264	Paul!
082265	Caesar,
082266	
082267	You must
082268	stand before
082269	
082270	
082271	has graciously granted you
082272	
082273	
082274	and God
082275	the safety of all
082276	
082277	who are sailing
082278	with you.’
082279	
082280	Therefore
082281	keep up your courage,
082282	men,
082283	I have faith in
082284	for
082285	
082286	God
082287	
082288	
082289	that it will be
082290	
082291	
082292	just as
082293	I have been told.
082294	
082295	on
082296	island.”
082297	But
082298	some
082299	we must
082300	
082301	run aground
082302	When
082303	
082304	the fourteenth
082305	night
082306	had come,
082307	were being driven across
082308	while we
082309	
082310	
082311	the Adriatic Sea,
082312	about
082313	midnight
082314	
082315	
082316	suspected
082317	
082318	the sailors
082319	they were approaching
082320	some
082321	
082322	land.
082323	
082324	They took soundings
082325	and found
082326	fathoms
082327	the water was twenty
082328	a little farther
082329	
082330	deep; when they had sailed
082331	
082332	again
082333	they took soundings
082334	and found
082335	fathoms deep.
082336	it was fifteen
082337	Because they were afraid
082338	
082339	
082340	
082341	on
082342	the rocky
082343	coast,
082344	that we would run aground
082345	from
082346	the stern
082347	they threw out
082348	anchors
082349	four
082350	and wished
082351	for day
082352	to appear.
082353	
082354	Then
082355	when the sailors
082356	tried
082357	to escape
082358	from
082359	
082360	the ship
082361	
082362	and were lowering
082363	
082364	the ship’s boat
082365	into
082366	
082367	the sea,
082368	pretending
082369	that
082370	from
082371	the bow,
082372	anchors
082373	they were going
082374	to put out
082375	said
082376	
082377	Paul
082378	
082379	to the centurion
082380	
082381	
082382	and the soldiers,
082383	
082384	“Unless
082385	
082386	these men stay
082387	with
082388	
082389	the ship,
082390	
082391	be saved.”
082392	
082393	you cannot
082394	Then
082395	cut
082396	
082397	the soldiers
082398	
082399	the ropes
082400	
082401	of the ship’s boat
082402	
082403	and let
082404	
082405	it drift away.
082406	As
082407	
082408	
082409	day
082410	was about
082411	to dawn,
082412	urged
082413	
082414	Paul
082415	them all
082416	to take
082417	some food,
082418	saying,
082419	“Today is the fourteenth
082420	
082421	day
082422	you have been in suspense
082423	without food;
082424	and have gone
082425	nothing.
082426	you have eaten
082427	Therefore
082428	I urge
082429	
082430	you to take
082431	some food,
082432	
082433	for
082434	
082435	
082436	for your
082437	survival.
082438	this is important
082439	not one
082440	For
082441	
082442	a hair
082443	from
082444	
082445	his head.”
082446	of you will lose
082447	After he said
082448	
082449	
082450	
082451	this, Paul took
082452	bread
082453	and gave thanks
082454	
082455	to God
082456	in front of
082457	them all,
082458	
082459	broke
082460	it, and began
082461	to eat.
082462	encouraged
082463	So
082464	of them were
082465	all
082466	
082467	
082468	and took
082469	food themselves.
082470	(We were
082471	
082472	
082473	in all
082474	persons
082475	on
082476	
082477	the ship.)
082478	two hundred
082479	seventy-
082480	six
082481	enough to be satisfied,
082482	
082483	When they had eaten
082484	they lightened
082485	
082486	the ship
082487	by throwing
082488	
082489	the wheat
082490	into
082491	
082492	the sea.
082493	When
082494	
082495	day
082496	came,
082497	
082498	the land,
082499	they did not
082500	recognize
082501	a bay
082502	but
082503	
082504	they noticed
082505	with
082506	a beach,
082507	
082508	where
082509	they decided
082510	if
082511	they could.
082512	to run
082513	
082514	the ship aground
082515	
082516	
082517	the anchors
082518	So they slipped
082519	and left
082520	them in
082521	
082522	the sea,
082523	at the same time
082524	loosening
082525	
082526	the linkage
082527	
082528	that bound the steering oars together.
082529	
082530	Then they hoisted
082531	
082532	the foresail
082533	
082534	to the wind
082535	and steered
082536	toward
082537	
082538	the beach.
082539	they encountered
082540	But
082541	
082542	a patch
082543	of crosscurrents
082544	and ran
082545	
082546	the ship aground;
082547	
082548	
082549	
082550	the bow
082551	stuck fast
082552	
082553	and could not be moved,
082554	
082555	but
082556	the stern
082557	was being broken up
082558	by
082559	
082560	the force
082561	
082562	of the waves.
082563	
082564	Now
082565	the soldiers’
082566	plan
082567	was
082568	to
082569	
082570	the prisoners
082571	kill
082572	so that none
082573	of them
082574	by swimming away.
082575	would escape
082576	
082577	But
082578	the centurion,
082579	wanting
082580	to save
082581	
082582	Paul’s
082583	life, prevented them
082584	
082585	
082586	from carrying out their plan.
082587	He ordered
082588	
082589	
082590	those who could
082591	swim
082592	to jump overboard
082593	first
082594	to
082595	
082596	land,
082597	and get
082598	
082599	
082600	and the rest were to follow,
082601	some
082602	
082603	on
082604	planks
082605	some
082606	and
082607	on
082608	pieces
082609	
082610	of
082611	
082612	the ship.
082613	
082614	And in this way
082615	were
082616	all
082617	brought safely
082618	to
082619	
082620	land.
082621	
082622	After we had safely reached shore,
082623	
082624	we learned
082625	
082626	Malta.
082627	
082628	that the island
082629	was called
082630	
082631	
082632	The local inhabitants
082633	showed us
082634	
082635	
082636	extraordinary
082637	kindness,
082638	
082639	they built
082640	for
082641	a fire
082642	and welcomed us
082643	all
082644	
082645	because
082646	
082647	to rain
082648	
082649	it had started
082650	
082651	
082652	
082653	and was cold.
082654	had gathered
082655	
082656	
082657	When Paul
082658	of brushwood
082659	
082660	a bundle
082661	
082662	and was putting
082663	it on
082664	
082665	the fire,
082666	a viper
082667	because of
082668	the
082669	heat
082670	came out
082671	and fastened itself
082672	on
082673	his hand.
082674	
082675	When
082676	
082677	saw
082678	
082679	the local people
082680	hanging
082681	
082682	the creature
082683	from
082684	
082685	Paul’s hand,
082686	
082687	to
082688	one another,
082689	they said
082690	“No doubt
082691	a murderer!
082692	is
082693	
082694	this man
082695	
082696	
082697	Although he has escaped
082698	from
082699	
082700	the sea,
082701	
082702	Justice
082703	him to live!”
082704	herself has not
082705	allowed
082706	
082707	
082708	However,
082709	Paul shook
082710	
082711	the creature
082712	off into
082713	
082714	the fire
082715	and suffered
082716	no
082717	harm.
082718	
082719	But
082720	they were expecting
082721	
082722	that he was going
082723	to swell up
082724	or
082725	drop
082726	suddenly
082727	dead.
082728	
082729	a long time
082730	So
082731	
082732	after they had waited
082733	
082734	and had seen
082735	nothing
082736	unusual
082737	to him,
082738	
082739	happen
082740	they changed their minds
082741	and said
082742	
082743	he was
082744	a god.
082745	in
082746	Now
082747	
082748	the region around
082749	
082750	place
082751	that
082752	belonging
082753	were fields
082754	
082755	to the chief official
082756	
082757	of the island,
082758	named
082759	Publius,
082760	who
082761	welcomed us
082762	
082763	for three
082764	days.
082765	hospitably as guests
082766	and entertained us
082767	
082768	
082769	
082770	The father
082771	
082772	of Publius
082773	fever
082774	
082775	and dysentery.
082776	sick in bed, suffering from
082777	lay
082778	
082779	to see him
082780	
082781	Paul
082782	went in
082783	
082784	and after praying,
082785	placed
082786	
082787	his hands on him
082788	
082789	and healed him.
082790	
082791	
082792	
082793	After this had happened,
082794	
082795	
082796	many of the people
082797	
082798	on
082799	
082800	the island
082801	who were
082802	sick
082803	also came
082804	
082805	and were healed.
082806	They
082807	
082808	many
082809	honors,
082810	also bestowed
082811	
082812	
082813	and when we were preparing to sail,
082814	they gave
082815	
082816	
082817	
082818	us all the supplies we needed.
082819	After
082820	
082821	three
082822	months
082823	we put out to sea
082824	in
082825	ship
082826	that had wintered
082827	at
082828	
082829	the island
082830	an Alexandrian
082831	as its figurehead.
082832	and had the “Heavenly Twins”
082833	
082834	We put in
082835	at
082836	Syracuse
082837	and stayed
082838	days.
082839	there three
082840	From there
082841	we cast off
082842	and arrived
082843	at
082844	Rhegium,
082845	
082846	and after
082847	one
082848	day
082849	sprang up
082850	a south wind
082851	and on the second day
082852	we came
082853	to
082854	Puteoli.
082855	There
082856	we found
082857	some brothers
082858	and were invited
082859	with them
082860	
082861	to stay
082862	days.
082863	seven
082864	
082865	And in this way
082866	to
082867	
082868	Rome.
082869	we came
082870	from there,
082871	
082872	The brothers
082873	when they heard
082874	
082875	about us,
082876	
082877	came
082878	to
082879	meet us.
082880	
082881	as far as
082882	of Appius
082883	the Forum
082884	
082885	and Three
082886	Taverns
082887	
082888	When he saw
082889	
082890	them, Paul
082891	thanked
082892	
082893	God
082894	and took
082895	courage.
082896	When
082897	
082898	we entered
082899	
082900	Rome,
082901	was allowed
082902	
082903	Paul
082904	to live
082905	by
082906	himself,
082907	with
082908	
082909	who was guarding him.
082910	
082911	the soldier
082912	
082913	
082914	After
082915	days
082916	three
082917	Paul called
082918	
082919	
082920	
082921	
082922	the local Jewish
082923	leaders together.
082924	When they had assembled,
082925	
082926	
082927	he said to them,
082928	
082929	
082930	
082931	
082932	“Brothers,
082933	nothing
082934	against
082935	although I had done
082936	
082937	our people
082938	or
082939	
082940	the customs
082941	
082942	of our ancestors,
082943	as a prisoner
082944	from
082945	Jerusalem
082946	I was handed over
082947	to
082948	
082949	
082950	
082951	the Romans.
082952	When they
082953	had heard
082954	my case,
082955	they wanted
082956	to release me,
082957	because
082958	
082959	there was no
082960	basis
082961	for a death
082962	sentence
082963	against me.
082964	
082965	objected,
082966	But
082967	
082968	when the Jews
082969	I was forced
082970	to appeal
082971	to Caesar –
082972	not
082973	that
082974	
082975	against my own people.
082976	
082977	I had
082978	some
082979	charge to bring
082980	for
082981	
082982	So
082983	
082984	this reason
082985	I have asked
082986	
082987	to see
082988	
082989	you and speak with
082990	because of
082991	you, for
082992	
082993	the hope
082994	
082995	of Israel.”
082996	
082997	with this chain
082998	
082999	I am bound
083000	
083001	
083002	
083003	
083004	They replied,
083005	“We
083006	no
083007	letters
083008	about you,
083009	
083010	have received
083011	from
083012	
083013	Judea
083014	nor
083015	come
083016	have any
083017	
083018	of the brothers
083019	from there and reported
083020	or
083021	said
083022	anything
083023	about you.
083024	
083025	bad
083026	we would like
083027	But
083028	from you
083029	
083030	to hear
083031	what
083032	you think,
083033	regarding
083034	
083035	for
083036	
083037	this sect
083038	
083039	we know
083040	
083041	
083042	
083043	that people everywhere
083044	speak against it.”
083045	They set
083046	
083047	
083048	a day to meet with him,
083049	and they came
083050	to him
083051	
083052	
083053	where
083054	he was staying
083055	in even greater numbers.
083056	things to them,
083057	he explained
083058	testifying
083059	
083060	about the kingdom
083061	
083062	of God
083063	and trying to convince them
083064	both
083065	
083066	about
083067	
083068	Jesus
083069	from
083070	
083071	
083072	the law
083073	of Moses
083074	
083075	
083076	and the prophets.
083077	From
083078	morning
083079	until
083080	evening
083081	
083082	
083083	
083084	Some were convinced
083085	
083086	by what he said,
083087	
083088	but
083089	others refused to believe.
083090	unable to agree
083091	So
083092	
083093	among
083094	themselves,
083095	they began to leave,
083096	made
083097	
083098	after Paul
083099	last statement:
083100	one
083101	
083102	rightly
083103	
083104	Spirit
083105	
083106	“The Holy
083107	spoke
083108	through
083109	Isaiah
083110	
083111	the prophet
083112	to
083113	
083114	your ancestors
083115	
083116	and say,
083117	‘Go
083118	to
083119	
083120	this people
083121	
083122	
083123	when he said,
083124	“You will keep on hearing,
083125	
083126	
083127	
083128	but will never
083129	understand,
083130	
083131	looking,
083132	and you will keep on
083133	
083134	
083135	but will never
083136	perceive.
083137	has become dull,
083138	For
083139	
083140	the heart
083141	
083142	of this people
083143	
083144	
083145	
083146	and their ears
083147	are hard
083148	of hearing,
083149	
083150	
083151	their eyes,
083152	
083153	and they have closed
083154	so that they would not
083155	see
083156	
083157	with their eyes
083158	
083159	
083160	with their ears
083161	and hear
083162	
083163	
083164	with their heart
083165	and understand
083166	
083167	and turn,
083168	
083169	and I would heal them.”’
083170	
083171	advised
083172	“Therefore
083173	be
083174	
083175	
083176	
083177	to the Gentiles;
083178	has been sent
083179	
083180	
083181	that this salvation
083182	
083183	from God
083184	
083185	
083186	they will listen!”
083187	Paul lived
083188	
083189	there two
083190	whole years
083191	in
083192	his own
083193	rented quarters
083194	
083195	and welcomed
083196	all
083197	
083198	who came
083199	to him,
083200	
083201	proclaiming
083202	
083203	the kingdom
083204	
083205	of God
083206	
083207	and teaching
083208	
083209	about
083210	
083211	the Lord
083212	Jesus
083213	Christ
083214	with
083215	complete
083216	boldness
083217	and without restriction.
083218	From Paul,
083219	a slave
083220	of Christ
083221	Jesus,
083222	called
083223	to be an apostle,
083224	set apart
083225	for
083226	the gospel
083227	of God.
083228	This gospel
083229	he promised beforehand
083230	through
083231	
083232	his prophets
083233	
083234	in
083235	scriptures,
083236	the holy
083237	concerning
083238	
083239	his Son
083240	
083241	
083242	who was
083243	
083244	a descendant
083245	of David
083246	with reference to
083247	the flesh,
083248	
083249	who was appointed
083250	the Son-
083251	of-God-
083252	in-
083253	power
083254	according to
083255	Spirit
083256	the Holy
083257	by
083258	the resurrection
083259	from the dead,
083260	Jesus
083261	Christ
083262	
083263	our Lord.
083264	
083265	Through
083266	him
083267	we have received
083268	grace
083269	
083270	and our apostleship
083271	to
083272	bring about the obedience
083273	of faith
083274	among
083275	all
083276	
083277	the Gentiles
083278	on behalf of
083279	
083280	his name.
083281	
083282	among
083283	them,
083284	You also are
083285	
083286	
083287	called
083288	to belong to Jesus
083289	Christ.
083290	To all
083291	
083292	
083293	in
083294	Rome,
083295	those loved
083296	by God
083297	called
083298	to be saints:
083299	Grace
083300	
083301	
083302	and peace to you
083303	from
083304	God
083305	our Father
083306	
083307	
083308	and the Lord
083309	Jesus
083310	Christ!
083311	First of all,
083312	
083313	I thank
083314	
083315	my God
083316	
083317	through
083318	Jesus
083319	Christ
083320	for
083321	all of you,
083322	
083323	
083324	
083325	because your faith
083326	
083327	is proclaimed
083328	throughout
083329	the whole
083330	
083331	world.
083332	my witness
083333	For
083334	
083335	is
083336	
083337	God,
083338	whom
083339	I serve
083340	in
083341	
083342	my spirit
083343	
083344	by
083345	
083346	preaching the gospel
083347	
083348	of his Son,
083349	
083350	that
083351	I continually
083352	remember you
083353	
083354	
083355	and I always
083356	in
083357	
083358	my prayers,
083359	
083360	ask
083361	if
083362	perhaps
083363	now
083364	at last
083365	I may succeed
083366	in
083367	
083368	according to the will
083369	
083370	of God.
083371	visiting you
083372	
083373	
083374	I long
083375	For
083376	to see you,
083377	
083378	so that
083379	some
083380	I may impart to you
083381	gift
083382	
083383	spiritual
083384	to
083385	
083386	strengthen you,
083387	
083388	
083389	
083390	that is,
083391	that we may be mutually comforted
083392	
083393	
083394	by
083395	
083396	
083397	one another’s
083398	faith,
083399	
083400	both yours and mine.
083401	
083402	
083403	I do not
083404	want
083405	
083406	
083407	you to be unaware,
083408	brothers and sisters,
083409	
083410	that I often
083411	intended
083412	to come
083413	to
083414	
083415	
083416	you (and was prevented
083417	until
083418	
083419	now),
083420	so that
083421	some
083422	fruit
083423	I may have
083424	
083425	even among you,
083426	
083427	just as
083428	
083429	I already have among
083430	
083431	the rest
083432	of the Gentiles.
083433	to the Greeks
083434	both
083435	
083436	and to the barbarians,
083437	to the wise
083438	both
083439	
083440	and to the foolish.
083441	a debtor
083442	I am
083443	Thus
083444	
083445	
083446	
083447	I am eager
083448	
083449	
083450	
083451	who are in
083452	Rome.
083453	also to preach the gospel to you
083454	I am not
083455	For
083456	ashamed
083457	
083458	of the gospel,
083459	power
083460	for
083461	God’s
083462	it is
083463	for
083464	salvation
083465	to everyone
083466	
083467	who believes,
083468	to the Jew
083469	and
083470	first
083471	
083472	also to the Greek.
083473	the righteousness
083474	For
083475	of God
083476	in
083477	
083478	is revealed
083479	the gospel from
083480	faith
083481	to
083482	faith,
083483	just as
083484	it is written,
083485	
083486	
083487	“The righteous
083488	by
083489	faith
083490	will live.”
083491	is revealed
083492	For
083493	the wrath
083494	of God
083495	from
083496	heaven
083497	against
083498	all
083499	ungodliness
083500	
083501	and unrighteousness
083502	of people
083503	
083504	
083505	the truth
083506	by
083507	their unrighteousness,
083508	who suppress
083509	because
083510	
083511	what can be known
083512	
083513	about God
083514	plain
083515	is
083516	to them,
083517	
083518	
083519	God
083520	because
083521	to them.
083522	has made it plain
083523	
083524	For
083525	his invisible attributes –
083526	
083527	since
083528	the creation
083529	of the world
083530	
083531	through what has been made.
083532	because they are understood
083533	have been clearly seen,
083534	
083535	
083536	his eternal
083537	
083538	power
083539	
083540	and divine nature –
083541	So
083542	
083543	people are
083544	
083545	without excuse.
083546	For
083547	although they knew
083548	
083549	God,
083550	they did not
083551	him as
083552	God
083553	glorify
083554	or
083555	give him thanks,
083556	but
083557	they became futile
083558	in
083559	
083560	their thoughts
083561	
083562	
083563	were darkened.
083564	
083565	and their senseless
083566	
083567	hearts
083568	Although they claimed
083569	to be
083570	wise,
083571	they became fools
083572	
083573	and exchanged
083574	
083575	the glory
083576	
083577	of the immortal
083578	God
083579	for

083585	or birds
083586	
083587	or four-footed animals
083588	
083589	or reptiles.
083590	Therefore
083591	gave
083592	them over
083593	
083594	God
083595	in
083596	
083597	the desires
083598	
083599	of their hearts
083600	
083601	to
083602	impurity,
083603	
083604	to dishonor
083605	
083606	their bodies
083607	
083608	among themselves.
083609	
083610	They
083611	exchanged
083612	
083613	the truth
083614	
083615	of God
083616	for
083617	
083618	a lie
083619	
083620	and worshiped
083621	
083622	and served
083623	
083624	the creation
083625	rather than
083626	
083627	the Creator,
083628	who
083629	is
083630	blessed
083631	
083632	
083633	forever!
083634	Amen.
083635	For
083636	
083637	gave
083638	them over
083639	
083640	this reason God
083641	to
083642	passions.
083643	dishonorable
083644	
083645	
083646	For
083647	their women
083648	
083649	exchanged
083650	
083651	the natural
083652	sexual relations
083653	for
083654	
083655	
083656	unnatural ones,
083657	and likewise
083658	
083659	
083660	
083661	the men
083662	also abandoned
083663	
083664	natural
083665	relations
083666	
083667	with women
083668	and were inflamed
083669	in
083670	
083671	their passions
083672	
083673	for
083674	one another.
083675	Men
083676	with
083677	men
083678	
083679	shameless acts
083680	committed
083681	
083682	
083683	the due penalty
083684	
083685	
083686	
083687	for their error.
083688	
083689	in
083690	themselves
083691	and received
083692	
083693	And just as
083694	they did not
083695	see fit
083696	
083697	God,
083698	
083699	to
083700	acknowledge
083701	gave
083702	them over
083703	
083704	God
083705	to
083706	a depraved
083707	mind,
083708	to do
083709	
083710	what should not
083711	be done.
083712	They are filled
083713	with every kind
083714	of unrighteousness,
083715	wickedness,
083716	covetousness,
083717	malice.
083718	They are rife
083719	with envy,
083720	murder,
083721	strife,
083722	deceit,
083723	hostility.
083724	They are gossips,
083725	slanderers,
083726	haters of God,
083727	insolent,
083728	arrogant,
083729	boastful,
083730	contrivers
083731	of all sorts of evil,
083732	to parents,
083733	disobedient
083734	senseless,
083735	covenant-breakers,
083736	heartless,
083737	ruthless.
083738	Although they
083739	
083740	righteous decree
083741	
083742	God’s
083743	fully know
083744	
083745	
083746	
083747	such things
083748	that those who practice
083749	deserve
083750	to die,
083751	
083752	they not
083753	only
083754	
083755	do them
083756	but
083757	
083758	also approve
083759	
083760	of those who practice them.
083761	Therefore
083762	without excuse,
083763	you are
083764	
083765	whoever you are,
083766	
083767	
083768	when you judge
083769	on
083770	whatever grounds
083771	someone else. For
083772	you judge
083773	
083774	another,
083775	yourself,
083776	you condemn
083777	
083778	because
083779	
083780	practice the same things.
083781	
083782	you who judge
083783	we know
083784	Now
083785	
083786	
083787	judgment
083788	
083789	that God’s
083790	is
083791	in accordance with
083792	truth
083793	against
083794	
083795	
083796	such things.
083797	those who practice
083798	do you think,
083799	And
083800	
083801	
083802	whoever
083803	
083804	you are, when you judge
083805	
083806	
083807	such things
083808	those who practice
083809	
083810	and yet do them
083811	
083812	
083813	
083814	yourself, that you will escape
083815	
083816	judgment?
083817	
083818	God’s
083819	Or
083820	
083821	for the wealth
083822	
083823	of his kindness,
083824	
083825	
083826	
083827	forbearance,
083828	
083829	
083830	and patience,
083831	do you have contempt
083832	and yet do not know
083833	
083834	
083835	kindness
083836	
083837	that God’s
083838	to
083839	repentance?
083840	
083841	leads you
083842	because of
083843	But
083844	
083845	your stubbornness
083846	
083847	
083848	and your unrepentant
083849	heart,
083850	you are storing up
083851	for yourselves
083852	wrath
083853	in
083854	the day
083855	of wrath,
083856	
083857	is revealed!
083858	righteous judgment
083859	
083860	when God’s
083861	He
083862	will reward
083863	each one
083864	according to
083865	
083866	his works:

083868	
083869	
083870	to those who by
083871	perseverance
083872	works
083873	in good

083880	life
083881	eternal

083933	with

083935	God.
083936	all
083937	For
083938	apart from the law
083939	who have sinned
083940	apart from the law,
083941	
083942	will also perish

083954	those who hear
083955	the law
083956	who are righteous
083957	before

083959	God,
083960	but
083961	
083962	those who do
083963	the law
083964	will be declared righteous.
083965	whenever
083966	For
083967	the Gentiles,
083968	
083969	who do not
083970	the law,
083971	have
083972	by nature
083973	
083974	
083975	the things required by the law,

083978	the law
083979	these who do not

083987	that the work

083989	of the law
083990	is written
083991	in
083992	
083993	their hearts,

084040	his will
084041	
084042	and approve
084043	
084044	the superior things
084045	because you receive instruction
084046	from
084047	
084048	the law,
084049	if you are convinced
084050	and
084051	that you yourself
084052	a guide
084053	are
084054	to the blind,
084055	a light
084056	
084057	to those who are in
084058	darkness,
084059	an educator
084060	of the senseless,
084061	a teacher
084062	of little children,
084063	because you have
084064	
084065	the essential features
084066	
084067	of knowledge

084092	You who abhor

084096	You who
084097	in
084098	the law

084100	by
084101	
084102	transgressing
084103	
084104	the law!
084105	
084106	God
084107	dishonor
084108	
084109	For
084110	“the name
084111	
084112	of God
084113	because of you.”
084114	
084115	is being blasphemed
084116	among
084117	
084118	the Gentiles
084119	just as
084120	it is written,
084121	circumcision
084122	
084123	For
084124	has its value
084125	if
084126	the law,
084127	you practice
084128	if
084129	but
084130	you break
084131	the law,
084132	
084133	
084134	your circumcision
084135	
084136	uncircumcision.
084137	has become
084138	if
084139	Therefore
084140	
084141	the uncircumcised man
084142	
084143	the righteous requirements
084144	
084145	of the law,
084146	obeys
084147	will not
084148	
084149	his uncircumcision
084150	
084151	as
084152	circumcision?
084153	be regarded
084154	
084155	will judge you
084156	
084157	
084158	The physically
084159	uncircumcised man,
084160	
084161	the law,
084162	by keeping
084163	
084164	
084165	even though
084166	you have the letter
084167	
084168	and circumcision!
084169	to be the transgressor
084170	of the law,
084171	not
084172	For
084173	a person
084174	
084175	who is one
084176	outwardly,
084177	a Jew
084178	is
084179	nor
084180	
084181	
084182	something that
084183	is outward
084184	in
084185	the flesh,
084186	is circumcision
084187	but
084188	
084189	by
084190	
084191	who is one inwardly,
084192	someone is a Jew
084193	
084194	and circumcision
084195	is of the heart
084196	
084197	the Spirit
084198	not
084199	by the letter.
084200	and
084201	
084202	This person’s praise
084203	is not
084204	from
084205	people
084206	but
084207	from
084208	
084209	God.
084210	what
084211	Therefore
084212	
084213	advantage
084214	
084215	does the Jew
084216	have, or
084217	what
084218	
084219	is the value
084220	
084221	of circumcision?
084222	Actually, there are many
084223	
084224	of all,
084225	advantages.
084226	First
084227	
084228	
084229	
084230	the Jews were entrusted
084231	
084232	with the oracles
084233	
084234	of God.
084235	What
084236	then?
084237	If
084238	believe,
084239	some
084240	did not
084241	
084242	does their unbelief
084243	
084244	
084245	the faithfulness
084246	
084247	of God?
084248	nullify
084249	not!
084250	Absolutely
084251	be proven
084252	
084253	
084254	Let God
084255	true,
084256	every
084257	and
084258	human being
084259	shown up as a liar,
084260	just as
084261	it is written:
084262	“so that
084263	
084264	you will be justified
084265	in
084266	
084267	your words
084268	
084269	
084270	and will prevail
084271	when
084272	
084273	you are judged.”
084274	
084275	if
084276	But
084277	
084278	our unrighteousness
084279	
084280	of God,
084281	the righteousness
084282	demonstrates
084283	what
084284	is he? (I am speaking
084285	is not
084286	unrighteous,
084287	
084288	The God
084289	
084290	who inflicts
084291	
084292	wrath
084293	in
084294	human terms.)
084295	shall we say?
084296	not!
084297	Absolutely
084298	For otherwise
084299	how
084300	judge
084301	
084302	could God
084303	
084304	the world?
084305	if
084306	For
084307	
084308	the truth
084309	
084310	of God
084311	by

084313	my
084314	lie
084315	enhances
084316	
084317	
084318	his glory,
084319	
084320	why
084321	still
084322	am I
084323	as
084324	a sinner?
084325	actually being judged
084326	
084327	And why not
084328	as some
084329	who slander us
084330	
084331	
084332	allege that we say.
084333	
084334	
084335	say,
084336	
084337	“Let us do
084338	
084339	evil
084340	so that
084341	may come of it”? –
084342	
084343	good
084344	(Their
084345	
084346	condemnation
084347	deserved!)
084348	is
084349	What
084350	then?
084351	Are we better off?
084352	not,
084353	Certainly
084354	we have already charged
084355	for
084356	that Jews
084357	alike
084358	
084359	and Greeks
084360	all
084361	under
084362	sin,
084363	are
084364	just as
084365	it is written:
084366	
084367	no one
084368	“There is
084369	righteous,
084370	not even
084371	one,
084372	no one
084373	there is
084374	
084375	who understands,
084376	no one
084377	there is
084378	
084379	who seeks
084380	
084381	God.
084382	All
084383	have turned away,
084384	together
084385	they have become worthless;
084386	no one
084387	there is
084388	
084389	who shows
084390	kindness,
084391	not
084392	
084393	even
084394	one.”
084395	graves,
084396	are open
084397	
084398	“Their throats
084399	
084400	
084401	with their tongues,
084402	
084403	they deceive
084404	the poison
084405	of asps
084406	is under
084407	
084408	their lips.”
084409	
084410	“Their
084411	
084412	mouths
084413	of cursing
084414	
084415	and bitterness.”
084416	are full
084417	are swift
084418	
084419	“Their feet
084420	
084421	to shed
084422	blood,
084423	ruin
084424	
084425	and misery
084426	are in
084427	
084428	their paths,
084429	
084430	
084431	and the way
084432	of peace
084433	they have not
084434	known.”
084435	no
084436	“There is
084437	fear
084438	of God
084439	before
084440	
084441	their eyes.”
084442	
084443	we know
084444	Now
084445	
084446	that whatever
084447	
084448	the law
084449	says,
084450	
084451	to those who are under
084452	
084453	the law,
084454	it says
084455	so that
084456	every
084457	mouth
084458	may be silenced
084459	
084460	held accountable
084461	may be
084462	and the whole
084463	
084464	world
084465	
084466	to God.
084467	For
084468	by
084469	the works
084470	of the law,
084471	
084472	is declared righteous
084473	no
084474	one
084475	before him
084476	
084477	through
084478	for
084479	the law
084480	comes the knowledge
084481	of sin.
084482	now
084483	But
084484	apart
084485	from the law
084486	the righteousness
084487	of God
084488	has been disclosed –
084489	(although it is attested
084490	by
084491	
084492	the law
084493	
084494	
084495	and the prophets)
084496	the righteousness
084497	namely,
084498	of God
084499	through
084500	the faithfulness
084501	of Jesus
084502	Christ
084503	for
084504	all
084505	
084506	who believe.
084507	no
084508	For
084509	there is
084510	distinction,
084511	all
084512	for
084513	have sinned
084514	
084515	and fall short
084516	
084517	of the glory
084518	
084519	of God.
084520	But they are justified
084521	freely
084522	
084523	
084524	by his grace
084525	through
084526	
084527	the redemption
084528	
084529	that is in
084530	Christ
084531	Jesus.
084532	him
084533	publicly displayed
084534	
084535	God
084536	as the mercy seat
084537	accessible through
084538	
084539	faith.
084540	at
084541	
084542	
084543	his death
084544	This was to
084545	demonstrate
084546	
084547	his righteousness,
084548	
084549	because
084550	God
084551	in his forbearance
084552	
084553	had passed over
084554	the sins previously committed.
084555	in
084556	
084557	
084558	
084559	
084560	
084561	
084562	This was also to demonstrate
084563	
084564	his righteousness
084565	
084566	
084567	
084568	the present
084569	time,
084570	so that
084571	
084572	he would be
084573	
084574	just
084575	
084576	and the justifier
084577	
084578	of the one who lives because of
084579	faithfulness.
084580	Jesus’
084581	Where,
084582	then,
084583	
084584	is boasting?
084585	It is excluded!
084586	By
084587	what
084588	principle?
084589	
084590	Of works?
084591	No,
084592	but
084593	by
084594	the principle
084595	of faith!
084596	we consider
084597	For
084598	is declared righteous
084599	by faith
084600	that a person
084601	apart from
084602	the works
084603	of the law.
084604	Or
084605	the God of the Jews
084606	
084607	is God
084608	only?
084609	Is he not
084610	
084611	the God of the Gentiles
084612	too? Yes,
084613	
084614	of the Gentiles too!
084615	Since
084616	is one,
084617	
084618	God
084619	
084620	he will justify
084621	the circumcised
084622	by
084623	faith
084624	
084625	and the uncircumcised
084626	through
084627	
084628	faith.
084629	the law
084630	Do we then
084631	nullify
084632	through
084633	
084634	faith?
084635	not!
084636	Absolutely
084637	Instead
084638	the law.
084639	we uphold
084640	What
084641	then
084642	shall we say
084643	has discovered regarding this matter?
084644	that Abraham,
084645	
084646	our ancestor
084647	
084648	according
084649	to the flesh,
084650	if
084651	For
084652	Abraham
084653	by
084654	works,
084655	was declared righteous
084656	he has
084657	something to boast
084658	about – but
084659	not
084660	before
084661	God.
084662	what
084663	For
084664	
084665	does the scripture
084666	say?
084667	believed
084668	
084669	“Abraham
084670	
084671	God,
084672	
084673	and it was credited to him
084674	
084675	as
084676	righteousness.”
084677	
084678	Now
084679	to the one who works,
084680	
084681	his pay
084682	is not
084683	credited
084684	due
084685	to grace
084686	but
084687	due
084688	to obligation.
084689	
084690	But
084691	to the one who does not
084692	work,
084693	believes
084694	but
084695	in
084696	
084697	the one who declares
084698	
084699	the ungodly
084700	is credited righteous,
084701	
084702	his faith
084703	
084704	as
084705	righteousness.
084706	So
084707	
084708	even David
084709	himself speaks
084710	
084711	regarding the blessedness
084712	
084713	of the man
084714	to whom
084715	
084716	God
084717	credits
084718	righteousness
084719	apart from
084720	works:
084721	“Blessed
084722	are those whose
084723	are forgiven,
084724	
084725	lawless deeds
084726	
084727	and whose
084728	are covered;
084729	
084730	sins
084731	blessed
084732	is the one
084733	against whom
084734	
084735	will never
084736	count
084737	the Lord
084738	sin.”
084739	
084740	Is this blessedness
084741	then
084742	
084743	for
084744	
084745	the circumcision
084746	or
084747	
084748	also for
084749	
084750	the uncircumcision?
084751	we say,
084752	For
084753	was credited
084754	
084755	to Abraham
084756	
084757	“faith
084758	as
084759	righteousness.”
084760	How
084761	then
084762	was it credited
084763	
084764	he circumcised
084765	to him? Was
084766	at the time, or
084767	
084768	not?
084769	No, he was not
084770	
084771	circumcised
084772	but
084773	
084774	uncircumcised!
084775	
084776	the sign
084777	And he received
084778	of circumcision
084779	as a seal
084780	
084781	of the righteousness
084782	
084783	that he had by faith
084784	
084785	while
084786	
084787	he was still uncircumcised,
084788	so that
084789	
084790	he would become
084791	
084792	the father
084793	of all
084794	
084795	those who believe
084796	
084797	but have never been circumcised,
084798	that
084799	
084800	credited to them.
084801	
084802	
084803	
084804	they too could have righteousness
084805	
084806	And he is also the father
084807	of the circumcised,
084808	
084809	who are not
084810	
084811	circumcised,
084812	only
084813	but
084814	
084815	
084816	who also walk
084817	
084818	in the footsteps
084819	
084820	possessed when
084821	he was still uncircumcised.
084822	of the faith
084823	
084824	that our father
084825	
084826	Abraham
084827	
084828	For
084829	was not fulfilled through
084830	the law,
084831	
084832	the promise
084833	
084834	to Abraham
084835	or
084836	
084837	to his descendants
084838	
084839	
084840	that he would inherit
084841	
084842	
084843	the world
084844	but
084845	through
084846	the righteousness
084847	that comes by faith.
084848	if
084849	For
084850	
084851	by
084852	the law,
084853	they become heirs
084854	is empty
084855	
084856	faith
084857	
084858	is nullified.
084859	
084860	and the promise
084861	
084862	For
084863	the law
084864	wrath,
084865	brings
084866	where
084867	because
084868	no
084869	there is
084870	law
084871	there is no
084872	transgression either.
084873	For
084874	
084875	this reason it is by
084876	faith
084877	so that it may be
084878	by
084879	grace,
084880	with the result that
084881	
084882	may be
084883	certain
084884	
084885	the promise
084886	to all
084887	
084888	the descendants –
084889	not
084890	
084891	to those who are under
084892	
084893	the law,
084894	only
084895	but
084896	
084897	
084898	
084899	also to those who have the faith
084900	of Abraham,
084901	who
084902	is
084903	the father of us
084904	all
084905	
084906	(as
084907	it is written,
084908	
084909	the father
084910	of many
084911	nations”).
084912	“I have made you
084913	
084914	He is our father in the presence
084915	whom
084916	he believed –
084917	of God
084918	
084919	the God who makes
084920	
084921	the dead alive
084922	
084923	and summons
084924	
084925	the things that do not
084926	yet exist
084927	as
084928	though they already do.
084929	Abraham
084930	Against
084931	hope
084932	in
084933	hope
084934	believed
084935	with the result that
084936	
084937	he became
084938	
084939	the father
084940	of many
084941	nations
084942	according to
084943	
084944	the pronouncement,
084945	“so
084946	will
084947	
084948	your descendants be.”
084949	
084950	
084951	Without
084952	being weak
084953	
084954	in faith,
084955	he considered
084956	
084957	his own
084958	body
084959	
084960	as dead
084961	one hundred years old)
084962	about
084963	(because he was
084964	
084965	
084966	and the deadness

084969	of Sarah’s
084970	about
084971	
084972	
084973	the promise

084975	of God
084976	He did not
084977	waver
084978	
084979	in unbelief
084980	but
084981	was strengthened
084982	
084983	in faith,
084984	giving
084985	glory
084986	
084987	to God.
084988	
084989	He was fully convinced
084990	
084991	that what
084992	God promised
084993	also able
084994	he was
084995	
084996	to do.
084997	So
084998	
084999	indeed it was credited
085000	
085001	to Abraham as
085002	righteousness.
085003	was not
085004	written
085005	But
085006	for
085007	Abraham’s sake,
085008	only
085009	
085010	the statement it was credited to him
085011	
085012	but
085013	
085014	also for
085015	our sake,
085016	to whom
085017	it will
085018	be credited,
085019	
085020	those who believe
085021	in
085022	
085023	the one who raised
085024	Jesus
085025	
085026	our Lord
085027	
085028	from
085029	the dead.
085030	He
085031	was given over
085032	because
085033	
085034	of our transgressions
085035	
085036	
085037	and was raised
085038	for the sake of
085039	
085040	our justification.
085041	
085042	been declared righteous
085043	Therefore, since we have
085044	by
085045	faith,
085046	peace
085047	we have
085048	with
085049	
085050	God
085051	through
085052	
085053	our Lord
085054	
085055	Jesus
085056	Christ,
085057	through
085058	whom
085059	
085060	
085061	also obtained access
085062	we have
085063	
085064	by faith
085065	into
085066	
085067	this grace
085068	
085069	in
085070	which
085071	we stand,
085072	
085073	and we rejoice
085074	in
085075	the hope
085076	
085077	glory.
085078	
085079	of God’s
085080	Not
085081	only
085082	
085083	this, but
085084	
085085	we also rejoice
085086	in
085087	
085088	sufferings,
085089	knowing
085090	
085091	
085092	that suffering
085093	endurance,
085094	produces
085095	
085096	and
085097	endurance,
085098	character,
085099	
085100	and
085101	character,
085102	hope.
085103	
085104	And
085105	hope
085106	does not
085107	disappoint,
085108	
085109	
085110	because the love
085111	
085112	of God
085113	has been poured out
085114	in
085115	
085116	our hearts
085117	
085118	through
085119	Spirit
085120	the Holy
085121	
085122	who was given to us.
085123	
085124	still
085125	For
085126	Christ
085127	while we were
085128	
085129	helpless,
085130	
085131	at the right
085132	time
085133	for
085134	the ungodly.
085135	died
085136	rarely
085137	(For
085138	for
085139	a righteous person,
085140	will anyone
085141	die
085142	
085143	though for
085144	
085145	a good person
085146	perhaps
085147	someone
085148	
085149	might possibly dare
085150	to die.)
085151	demonstrates
085152	But
085153	
085154	his own
085155	love
085156	for us,
085157	
085158	
085159	God
085160	
085161	still
085162	sinners,
085163	in that while we were
085164	
085165	Christ
085166	for us.
085167	
085168	died
085169	Much
085170	then,
085171	more
085172	been declared righteous
085173	because we have now
085174	by
085175	
085176	his blood,
085177	
085178	we will be saved
085179	through him
085180	
085181	from
085182	
085183	God’s wrath.
085184	if
085185	For
085186	enemies
085187	while we were
085188	we were reconciled
085189	
085190	to God
085191	through
085192	
085193	the death
085194	
085195	of his Son,
085196	
085197	how much
085198	more,
085199	since we have been reconciled,
085200	will we be saved
085201	by
085202	
085203	his life?
085204	
085205	Not
085206	only
085207	
085208	this, but
085209	
085210	we also rejoice
085211	in
085212	
085213	God
085214	through
085215	
085216	our Lord
085217	
085218	Jesus
085219	Christ,
085220	through
085221	whom
085222	we have now
085223	
085224	this reconciliation.
085225	received
085226	through
085227	So then,
085228	just as
085229	through
085230	one
085231	man
085232	
085233	sin
085234	to
085235	
085236	the world
085237	entered
085238	
085239	
085240	
085241	sin,
085242	
085243	and death
085244	
085245	and so
085246	
085247	all
085248	people
085249	
085250	death
085251	spread
085252	
085253	because
085254	all
085255	sinned –
085256	before
085257	for
085258	the law
085259	was given, sin
085260	was
085261	in
085262	the world,
085263	for sin
085264	but
085265	there is no
085266	accounting
085267	no
085268	when there is
085269	law.
085270	Yet
085271	reigned
085272	
085273	death
085274	from
085275	Adam
085276	until
085277	Moses
085278	
085279	even over
085280	
085281	those who did not
085282	sin
085283	in
085284	
085285	the same way
085286	
085287	one) transgressed.
085288	that Adam
085289	(who
085290	is
085291	a type
085292	
085293	of the coming
085294	But
085295	is not
085296	like
085297	
085298	the transgression.
085299	
085300	
085301	
085302	the gracious gift
085303	if
085304	For
085305	
085306	
085307	of the one
085308	through the transgression
085309	
085310	the many
085311	died
085312	man, how much
085313	more
085314	
085315	did the grace
085316	
085317	of God
085318	
085319	
085320	and the gift
085321	by
085322	the grace
085323	
085324	
085325	of the one
085326	man
085327	Jesus
085328	Christ
085329	to
085330	
085331	the many!
085332	multiply
085333	
085334	is not
085335	like
085336	
085337	the one
085338	who sinned.
085339	
085340	And the gift
085341	
085342	
085343	For
085344	judgment,
085345	resulting from
085346	the one
085347	transgression, led to
085348	condemnation,
085349	
085350	but
085351	the gracious gift
085352	from
085353	the many
085354	failures
085355	led to
085356	justification.
085357	if,
085358	For
085359	
085360	
085361	of the one
085362	by the transgression
085363	
085364	man, death
085365	reigned
085366	through
085367	
085368	the one,
085369	how much
085370	more
085371	
085372	
085373	the abundance
085374	
085375	of grace
085376	
085377	
085378	and of the gift
085379	
085380	of righteousness
085381	will those who receive
085382	in
085383	life
085384	reign
085385	through
085386	
085387	the one,
085388	Jesus
085389	Christ!
085390	
085391	Consequently,
085392	just as
085393	came through
085394	one
085395	transgression,
085396	for
085397	all
085398	people
085399	for
085400	condemnation
085401	so
085402	
085403	too through
085404	the one
085405	righteous act
085406	
085407	all
085408	people.
085409	
085410	came righteousness
085411	leading to life
085412	just as
085413	For
085414	through
085415	
085416	the disobedience
085417	
085418	of the one
085419	man
085420	sinners,
085421	were made
085422	
085423	many
085424	so
085425	
085426	also through
085427	
085428	the obedience
085429	
085430	of one
085431	righteous.
085432	will be made
085433	
085434	man many
085435	the law
085436	Now
085437	came in
085438	so that
085439	may increase,
085440	
085441	the transgression
085442	where
085443	but
085444	increased,
085445	
085446	sin
085447	multiplied all the more,
085448	
085449	grace
085450	so that
085451	just as
085452	reigned
085453	
085454	sin
085455	in
085456	
085457	death,
085458	so
085459	
085460	
085461	also grace
085462	will reign
085463	through
085464	righteousness
085465	to
085466	life
085467	eternal
085468	through
085469	Jesus
085470	Christ
085471	
085472	our Lord.
085473	
085474	What
085475	then?
085476	shall we say
085477	Are we to remain
085478	
085479	in sin
085480	so that
085481	
085482	grace
085483	may increase?
085484	not!
085485	Absolutely
085486	can we who
085487	died
085488	
085489	to sin
085490	How
085491	still
085492	live
085493	in it?
085494	
085495	Or
085496	do you not know
085497	
085498	that as many as
085499	were baptized
085500	into
085501	Christ
085502	Jesus
085503	into
085504	
085505	his death?
085506	
085507	were baptized
085508	we have been buried with him
085509	Therefore
085510	
085511	through
085512	
085513	baptism
085514	into
085515	
085516	death,
085517	in order that
085518	just as
085519	was raised
085520	Christ
085521	from
085522	the dead
085523	through
085524	
085525	the glory
085526	
085527	of the Father,
085528	so
085529	
085530	
085531	
085532	a new
085533	life.
085534	we too may live
085535	if
085536	For
085537	united with
085538	we have become
085539	
085540	him in the likeness
085541	
085542	of his death,
085543	
085544	we will certainly
085545	
085546	
085547	united in the likeness of his resurrection.
085548	also be
085549	
085550	We know
085551	
085552	
085553	that our old
085554	
085555	man
085556	was crucified with him
085557	so that
085558	would no longer dominate us,
085559	
085560	the body
085561	
085562	of sin
085563	so that
085564	we would no longer
085565	be enslaved
085566	
085567	
085568	to sin.
085569	
085570	(For
085571	someone who has died
085572	has been freed
085573	from
085574	
085575	sin.)
085576	if
085577	Now
085578	we died
085579	with
085580	Christ,
085581	we believe
085582	
085583	
085584	that we will also live with him.
085585	
085586	We know
085587	
085588	that since Christ
085589	has been raised
085590	from
085591	the dead,
085592	he is never
085593	going to die again;
085594	death
085595	
085596	no longer
085597	has mastery over him.
085598	the death
085599	For
085600	he died,
085601	
085602	to sin
085603	he died
085604	once for all,
085605	the life
085606	but
085607	he lives,
085608	he lives
085609	
085610	to God.
085611	So
085612	
085613	
085614	you too consider
085615	yourselves
085616	
085617	dead
085618	
085619	
085620	to sin,
085621	alive
085622	but
085623	
085624	to God
085625	in
085626	Christ
085627	Jesus.
085628	do not
085629	Therefore
085630	reign
085631	
085632	let sin
085633	in
085634	
085635	your mortal
085636	
085637	body
085638	so that
085639	
085640	you obey
085641	
085642	its desires,
085643	
085644	and
085645	do not present
085646	
085647	your members
085648	
085649	as instruments
085650	to be used for unrighteousness,
085651	
085652	to sin
085653	but
085654	present
085655	yourselves
085656	
085657	to God
085658	as
085659	from
085660	the dead
085661	those who are alive
085662	
085663	
085664	and your members
085665	
085666	as instruments
085667	to be used for righteousness.
085668	
085669	to God
085670	sin
085671	For
085672	
085673	will have no
085674	mastery over you,
085675	not
085676	because
085677	you are
085678	under
085679	law
085680	but
085681	under
085682	grace.
085683	What
085684	then?
085685	Shall we sin
085686	
085687	not
085688	because we are
085689	under
085690	law
085691	but
085692	under
085693	grace?
085694	not!
085695	Absolutely
085696	Do you not
085697	know
085698	
085699	of the one
085700	that if you present
085701	yourselves
085702	slaves,
085703	as
085704	obedient
085705	slaves
085706	you are
085707	
085708	you obey,
085709	either
085710	of sin
085711	resulting in
085712	death,
085713	or
085714	obedience
085715	resulting in
085716	righteousness?
085717	thanks
085718	But
085719	
085720	be to God
085721	
085722	that though you were
085723	slaves
085724	
085725	to sin,
085726	you obeyed
085727	
085728	from
085729	the heart
085730	to,
085731	that
085732	you were entrusted
085733	pattern
085734	of teaching
085735	having been freed
085736	and
085737	from
085738	
085739	sin,
085740	you became enslaved
085741	
085742	to righteousness.
085743	in human terms
085744	(I am speaking
085745	because of
085746	
085747	the weakness
085748	
085749	of your flesh.)
085750	
085751	just as
085752	For
085753	you once presented
085754	
085755	your members
085756	
085757	as slaves
085758	
085759	to impurity
085760	
085761	
085762	and lawlessness
085763	leading to
085764	
085765	more lawlessness,
085766	so
085767	now
085768	present
085769	
085770	your members
085771	
085772	as slaves
085773	
085774	to righteousness
085775	leading to
085776	sanctification.
085777	when
085778	For
085779	slaves
085780	you were
085781	
085782	of sin,
085783	free
085784	you were
085785	
085786	with regard to righteousness.
085787	what
085788	So
085789	benefit
085790	reap
085791	did you then
085792	from
085793	those things that
085794	you are now
085795	ashamed
085796	
085797	of? For
085798	the end
085799	of those things
085800	is death.
085801	now,
085802	But
085803	freed
085804	from
085805	
085806	sin
085807	enslaved
085808	and
085809	
085810	to God,
085811	you have
085812	
085813	your benefit
085814	
085815	leading to
085816	sanctification,
085817	
085818	and
085819	the end
085820	life.
085821	is eternal
085822	
085823	For
085824	the payoff
085825	
085826	of sin
085827	is death,
085828	
085829	but
085830	the gift
085831	
085832	of God
085833	life
085834	is eternal
085835	in
085836	Christ
085837	Jesus
085838	
085839	our Lord.
085840	
085841	Or
085842	do you not know,
085843	brothers and sisters
085844	to those who know
085845	(for
085846	the law),
085847	I am speaking
085848	
085849	
085850	that the law
085851	is lord
085852	
085853	over a person
085854	
085855	as
085856	long as
085857	he lives?
085858	
085859	For
085860	a married
085861	woman
085862	
085863	as long as he lives,
085864	to her husband
085865	is bound
085866	by law
085867	if
085868	but
085869	dies,
085870	
085871	her husband
085872	she is released
085873	from
085874	
085875	the law
085876	
085877	of the marriage.
085878	So
085879	then,
085880	is alive,
085881	
085882	man
085883	an adulteress.
085884	she will be called
085885	if
085886	she is joined
085887	while her husband
085888	to another
085889	if
085890	But
085891	dies,
085892	
085893	her husband
085894	free
085895	she is
085896	from
085897	
085898	that law,
085899	
085900	not
085901	she is
085902	
085903	an adulteress.
085904	and if she is joined
085905	man,
085906	to another
085907	So,
085908	my brothers and sisters,
085909	
085910	
085911	
085912	you also died
085913	
085914	to the law
085915	through
085916	
085917	the body
085918	
085919	of Christ,
085920	so that
085921	
085922	you could be joined
085923	
085924	to another,
085925	
085926	from
085927	the dead,
085928	to the one who was raised
085929	to
085930	bear fruit
085931	
085932	to God.
085933	when
085934	For
085935	we were
085936	in
085937	
085938	the flesh,
085939	
085940	the sinful
085941	
085942	desires,
085943	
085944	aroused by
085945	
085946	the law,
085947	were active
085948	in
085949	
085950	the members
085951	
085952	of our body to
085953	
085954	bear fruit
085955	
085956	for death.
085957	now
085958	But
085959	we have been released
085960	from
085961	
085962	the law, because we
085963	have died
085964	to
085965	what
085966	controlled
085967	us, so that
085968	we may serve
085969	
085970	in
085971	the new life
085972	of the Spirit
085973	
085974	and not
085975	under the old
085976	written code.
085977	What
085978	then?
085979	shall we say
085980	Is the
085981	law
085982	sin?
085983	not!
085984	Absolutely
085985	Certainly,
085986	
085987	sin
085988	I would not
085989	have known
085990	
085991	except
085992	through
085993	the law.
085994	
085995	indeed
085996	For
085997	what it means to desire something belonging to someone else
085998	I would not
085999	have known
086000	if
086001	had not
086002	
086003	the law
086004	said,
086005	“Do not
086006	covet.”
086007	the opportunity
086008	But
086009	seizing
086010	
086011	sin,
086012	through
086013	
086014	the commandment,
086015	produced
086016	in me
086017	
086018	all kinds
086019	of wrong desires.
086020	apart from
086021	For
086022	the law,
086023	sin
086024	is dead.
086025	
086026	And
086027	alive
086028	apart from
086029	the law,
086030	I was once
086031	with the coming
086032	but
086033	
086034	of the commandment
086035	
086036	sin
086037	became alive
086038	
086039	and
086040	I died.
086041	
086042	So I found
086043	
086044	
086045	that the very commandment
086046	
086047	that was intended to bring
086048	life
086049	
086050	brought
086051	death!
086052	
086053	For
086054	sin,
086055	the opportunity
086056	seizing
086057	through
086058	
086059	the commandment,
086060	deceived me
086061	
086062	
086063	and through
086064	
086065	it I died.
086066	So then,
086067	
086068	
086069	the law
086070	is holy,
086071	
086072	
086073	and the commandment
086074	is holy,
086075	
086076	righteous,
086077	
086078	and good.
086079	
086080	then,
086081	Did that which is good,
086082	
086083	become
086084	death to me?
086085	not!
086086	Absolutely
086087	But
086088	
086089	sin,
086090	so that
086091	it would be shown
086092	to be sin,
086093	through
086094	
086095	what is good,
086096	
086097	produced
086098	death in me
086099	so that
086100	would become
086101	
086102	utterly
086103	sinful.
086104	
086105	sin
086106	through
086107	
086108	the commandment
086109	we know
086110	For
086111	
086112	
086113	that the law
086114	spiritual –
086115	is
086116	
086117	but
086118	unspiritual,
086119	I am
086120	sold into slavery
086121	to
086122	
086123	sin.
086124	what
086125	For
086126	I am doing.
086127	I don’t
086128	understand
086129	I do not
086130	For
086131	what
086132	I want –
086133	
086134	do
086135	instead,
086136	what
086137	I hate.
086138	
086139	I do
086140	if
086141	But
086142	what
086143	I don’t
086144	want,
086145	
086146	I do
086147	I agree
086148	
086149	that the law
086150	
086151	is good.
086152	now it
086153	But
086154	is no longer me
086155	
086156	doing it,
086157	
086158	but
086159	
086160	that lives
086161	in me.
086162	
086163	sin
086164	I know
086165	For
086166	
086167	that nothing
086168	lives
086169	in me,
086170	
086171	
086172	that is,
086173	in
086174	
086175	my flesh.
086176	
086177	good
086178	
086179	For
086180	I want
086181	
086182	
086183	
086184	but
086185	do it.
086186	
086187	to do the good,
086188	I cannot
086189	not
086190	For
086191	
086192	I want,
086193	I do
086194	do the good
086195	but
086196	
086197	I do not
086198	want!
086199	the very evil
086200	
086201	I do
086202	if
086203	Now
086204	what
086205	I do not
086206	want, it
086207	
086208	
086209	I do
086210	is no longer me
086211	
086212	doing it
086213	
086214	but
086215	
086216	that lives
086217	in me.
086218	
086219	sin
086220	I find
086221	So,
086222	
086223	the law
086224	
086225	that when I want
086226	
086227	to do
086228	
086229	good,
086230	
086231	
086232	
086233	evil
086234	is present with me.
086235	I delight
086236	For
086237	
086238	in the law
086239	
086240	of God
086241	in
086242	
086243	my inner
086244	being.
086245	I see
086246	But
086247	a different
086248	law
086249	in
086250	
086251	my members
086252	
086253	waging war against
086254	
086255	the law
086256	
086257	of my mind
086258	
086259	
086260	and making
086261	me captive
086262	in
086263	
086264	to the law
086265	
086266	of sin
086267	
086268	that is
086269	
086270	
086271	my members.
086272	
086273	Wretched
086274	
086275	man
086276	that I am! Who
086277	
086278	will rescue me
086279	from
086280	
086281	this body
086282	
086283	of death?
086284	
086285	Thanks
086286	
086287	
086288	be to God
086289	through
086290	Jesus
086291	Christ
086292	
086293	our Lord!
086294	
086295	So
086296	then,
086297	
086298	
086299	
086300	
086301	with my mind,
086302	I myself serve
086303	the law
086304	of God
086305	
086306	but
086307	with my flesh
086308	I serve the law
086309	of sin.
086310	no
086311	There is therefore
086312	now
086313	condemnation
086314	
086315	for those who are in
086316	Christ
086317	Jesus.
086318	
086319	For
086320	the law
086321	
086322	Spirit
086323	
086324	of the life-giving
086325	in
086326	Christ
086327	Jesus
086328	has set
086329	you free
086330	from
086331	
086332	the law
086333	
086334	of sin
086335	
086336	
086337	and death.
086338	what
086339	For
086340	could not do
086341	
086342	the law
086343	
086344	
086345	because it was weakened
086346	through
086347	
086348	the flesh.
086349	
086350	God achieved
086351	
086352	his own
086353	Son
086354	By sending
086355	in
086356	the likeness
086357	flesh
086358	of sinful
086359	
086360	and concerning
086361	sin,
086362	he condemned
086363	
086364	sin
086365	in
086366	
086367	the flesh,
086368	so that
086369	
086370	the righteous requirement
086371	
086372	of the law
086373	may be fulfilled
086374	in us,
086375	
086376	
086377	who do not
086378	according
086379	to the flesh
086380	walk
086381	but
086382	according
086383	to the Spirit.
086384	
086385	For
086386	according to
086387	the flesh
086388	those who live
086389	
086390	
086391	by the things of the flesh,
086392	have their outlook shaped
086393	those
086394	but
086395	who live according to
086396	the Spirit
086397	have their outlook shaped by the things of
086398	the
086399	Spirit.
086400	
086401	For
086402	the outlook
086403	
086404	of the flesh
086405	is death,
086406	
086407	but
086408	the outlook
086409	
086410	of the Spirit
086411	is life
086412	
086413	and peace,
086414	because
086415	
086416	the outlook
086417	
086418	of the flesh
086419	is hostile
086420	to
086421	God,
086422	
086423	for
086424	to the law
086425	
086426	of God,
086427	it does not
086428	submit
086429	nor
086430	
086431	is it able to do so.
086432	
086433	
086434	in
086435	the flesh
086436	Those who are
086437	God.
086438	please
086439	
086440	cannot
086441	
086442	You, however,
086443	not
086444	are
086445	in
086446	the flesh
086447	but
086448	in
086449	the Spirit,
086450	if indeed
086451	the Spirit
086452	of God
086453	lives
086454	in you.
086455	
086456	if
086457	Now
086458	anyone
086459	the Spirit
086460	of Christ,
086461	does not
086462	have
086463	
086464	this person does not
086465	belong to him.
086466	
086467	if
086468	But
086469	Christ
086470	is in you,
086471	
086472	
086473	
086474	your body
086475	is dead
086476	because of
086477	sin,
086478	
086479	but
086480	the Spirit
086481	is your life
086482	because of
086483	righteousness.
086484	if
086485	Moreover
086486	
086487	the Spirit
086488	
086489	of the one who raised
086490	
086491	Jesus
086492	from
086493	the dead
086494	lives
086495	in you,
086496	
086497	
086498	the one who raised
086499	Christ
086500	from
086501	the dead
086502	will also make
086503	
086504	
086505	your mortal
086506	bodies alive
086507	
086508	through
086509	
086510	who lives
086511	
086512	his Spirit
086513	in you.
086514	
086515	So
086516	then,
086517	brothers and sisters,
086518	under obligation,
086519	we are
086520	not
086521	
086522	to the flesh,
086523	
086524	according to
086525	the flesh
086526	to live
086527	if
086528	(for
086529	according to
086530	the flesh,
086531	you live
086532	you will
086533	die),
086534	if
086535	but
086536	by the Spirit
086537	
086538	the deeds
086539	
086540	of the body
086541	you put to death
086542	you will live.
086543	all
086544	For
086545	by the Spirit
086546	of God
086547	who are led
086548	
086549	the sons
086550	of God.
086551	are
086552	you did not
086553	For
086554	receive
086555	the spirit
086556	of slavery
086557	again
086558	leading
086559	to fear,
086560	but
086561	you received
086562	the Spirit
086563	of adoption,
086564	by
086565	whom
086566	we cry,
086567	“Abba,
086568	
086569	Father.”
086570	
086571	
086572	The Spirit himself
086573	bears witness to
086574	
086575	our spirit
086576	
086577	
086578	that we are
086579	children.
086580	God’s
086581	if
086582	And
086583	children,
086584	
086585	then heirs
086586	(namely, heirs
086587	
086588	of God
086589	and also fellow heirs
086590	
086591	with Christ) –
086592	if indeed
086593	we suffer with
086594	him so
086595	
086596	we may also be glorified with him.
086597	I consider
086598	For
086599	
086600	cannot
086601	even be compared
086602	
086603	sufferings
086604	
086605	that our present
086606	
086607	to
086608	
086609	the coming
086610	glory
086611	that will be revealed
086612	to us.
086613	
086614	
086615	For
086616	eagerly waits
086617	
086618	the creation
086619	
086620	for the revelation
086621	
086622	of the sons
086623	
086624	of God.
086625	
086626	
086627	For
086628	to futility –
086629	
086630	the creation
086631	was subjected
086632	not
086633	willingly
086634	but
086635	because
086636	
086637	of God who subjected
086638	it – in
086639	hope
086640	
086641	
086642	
086643	
086644	that the creation
086645	itself will also be set free
086646	from
086647	
086648	the bondage
086649	
086650	of decay
086651	into
086652	
086653	freedom
086654	
086655	the glorious
086656	
086657	children.
086658	
086659	of God’s
086660	we know
086661	For
086662	
086663	that the whole
086664	
086665	creation
086666	groans
086667	
086668	and suffers together
086669	until
086670	
086671	now.
086672	Not
086673	only this,
086674	
086675	but
086676	
086677	
086678	
086679	the firstfruits
086680	
086681	of the Spirit,
086682	we ourselves also, who have
086683	
086684	
086685	
086686	
086687	inwardly
086688	groan
086689	our adoption,
086690	as we eagerly await
086691	
086692	the redemption
086693	
086694	of our bodies.
086695	
086696	
086697	For
086698	in hope
086699	we were saved.
086700	hope
086701	Now
086702	that is seen
086703	not
086704	is
086705	hope,
086706	
086707	because
086708	for what he sees?
086709	who
086710	hopes
086711	if
086712	But
086713	for what
086714	we do not
086715	see,
086716	we hope
086717	it with
086718	endurance.
086719	we eagerly wait for
086720	In the same way,
086721	
086722	
086723	
086724	the Spirit
086725	helps us in our
086726	
086727	weakness,
086728	
086729	
086730	for
086731	
086732	pray,
086733	how
086734	we should
086735	we do not
086736	know
086737	but
086738	
086739	
086740	the Spirit himself
086741	intercedes
086742	groanings.
086743	for us with inexpressible
086744	
086745	And
086746	he who searches
086747	
086748	our hearts
086749	knows
086750	
086751	
086752	the mind
086753	
086754	of the Spirit,
086755	
086756	according to
086757	God’s will.
086758	because the Spirit intercedes
086759	on behalf of
086760	the saints
086761	we know
086762	And
086763	
086764	
086765	for those who love
086766	
086767	God,
086768	that all things
086769	work together
086770	for
086771	good
086772	
086773	according to
086774	his purpose,
086775	called
086776	who are
086777	
086778	because those whom
086779	he foreknew
086780	
086781	he also predestined
086782	conformed
086783	
086784	to the image
086785	
086786	
086787	
086788	of his Son, that
086789	
086790	to be
086791	
086792	his Son would be the firstborn
086793	among
086794	many
086795	brothers and sisters.
086796	
086797	And
086798	those he predestined,
086799	
086800	
086801	he also called;
086802	
086803	
086804	and those he called,
086805	
086806	
086807	he also justified;
086808	
086809	
086810	and those he justified,
086811	
086812	
086813	he also glorified.
086814	What
086815	then
086816	shall we say
086817	about
086818	
086819	these things? If
086820	
086821	God
086822	is for us,
086823	
086824	who
086825	can be against us?
086826	
086827	he who
086828	Indeed,
086829	
086830	his own
086831	Son,
086832	did not
086833	spare
086834	but
086835	for us
086836	
086837	all –
086838	gave
086839	him up
086840	how
086841	will he not
086842	
086843	also, along with him,
086844	
086845	
086846	all things?
086847	
086848	freely give us
086849	Who
086850	will bring any charge
086851	against
086852	elect?
086853	God’s
086854	It is God
086855	
086856	who justifies.
086857	Who
086858	
086859	is the one who will condemn?
086860	Christ
086861	
086862	
086863	is the one who died
086864	more
086865	(and
086866	than that, he was raised),
086867	who
086868	
086869	is
086870	at
086871	the right hand
086872	
086873	of God,
086874	and who
086875	
086876	also is interceding
086877	for us.
086878	
086879	Who
086880	
086881	will separate us
086882	from
086883	
086884	the love
086885	
086886	of Christ?
086887	Will trouble,
086888	or
086889	distress,
086890	or
086891	persecution,
086892	or
086893	famine,
086894	or
086895	nakedness,
086896	or
086897	danger,
086898	or
086899	sword?
086900	As
086901	it is written,
086902	
086903	“For
086904	your sake
086905	we encounter death
086906	all
086907	
086908	day
086909	long; we were considered
086910	as
086911	sheep
086912	to be slaughtered.”
086913	No,
086914	in
086915	
086916	all
086917	these things we have complete victory
086918	through
086919	
086920	him who loved us!
086921	
086922	I am convinced
086923	For
086924	
086925	that neither
086926	death,
086927	nor
086928	life,
086929	nor
086930	angels,
086931	nor
086932	heavenly rulers,
086933	nor
086934	things that are present,
086935	nor
086936	things to come,
086937	nor
086938	powers,
086939	nor
086940	height,
086941	nor
086942	depth,
086943	nor
086944	anything
086945	in creation
086946	else
086947	will be able
086948	
086949	to separate us
086950	from
086951	
086952	the love
086953	
086954	of God
086955	
086956	in
086957	Christ
086958	Jesus
086959	
086960	our Lord.
086961	
086962	the truth
086963	I am telling
086964	in
086965	Christ
086966	(I am not
086967	lying!),
086968	assures me
086969	
086970	
086971	for my conscience
086972	
086973	in
086974	Spirit –
086975	the Holy
086976	
086977	sorrow
086978	
086979	I have
086980	great
086981	
086982	and unceasing
086983	anguish
086984	
086985	in my heart.
086986	
086987	I could wish
086988	For
086989	accursed –
086990	that I myself were
086991	
086992	
086993	cut off from
086994	
086995	Christ –
086996	for the sake
086997	
086998	of my people,
086999	
087000	
087001	countrymen,
087002	
087003	
087004	my fellow
087005	who
087006	are
087007	Israelites.
087008	To them
087009	
087010	belong the adoption as sons,
087011	
087012	
087013	the glory,
087014	
087015	
087016	the covenants,
087017	
087018	
087019	the giving of the law,
087020	
087021	
087022	the temple worship,
087023	
087024	
087025	and the promises.
087026	To them
087027	
087028	belong the patriarchs,
087029	
087030	and from
087031	them,
087032	
087033	came the Christ,
087034	
087035	by
087036	human descent,
087037	
087038	who is
087039	over
087040	all,
087041	God
087042	blessed
087043	
087044	
087045	forever!
087046	Amen.
087047	It is not
087048	as though
087049	
087050	
087051	had failed.
087052	
087053	the word
087054	
087055	of God
087056	not
087057	For
087058	all
087059	
087060	those who are descended from
087061	Israel
087062	
087063	are truly Israel,
087064	nor
087065	
087066	are
087067	true descendants;
087068	Abraham’s
087069	all
087070	the children
087071	rather
087072	“through
087073	Isaac
087074	be counted.”
087075	
087076	will your descendants
087077	
087078	This means it is
087079	not
087080	
087081	the children
087082	
087083	of the flesh
087084	
087085	who are the children
087086	
087087	of God;
087088	rather,
087089	
087090	the children
087091	
087092	of promise
087093	are counted
087094	as
087095	descendants.
087096	this is what the promise
087097	For
087098	
087099	declared:
087100	“About a year from now
087101	
087102	
087103	
087104	
087105	I will return
087106	
087107	will have
087108	
087109	and Sarah
087110	a son.”
087111	Not
087112	only
087113	
087114	that, but
087115	
087116	when Rebekah
087117	children by
087118	one man,
087119	conceived
087120	had
087121	Isaac –
087122	
087123	our ancestor
087124	
087125	before
087126	even
087127	they were born
087128	or
087129	had done
087130	anything
087131	good
087132	or
087133	bad
087134	(so that
087135	
087136	in
087137	election
087138	purpose
087139	
087140	God’s
087141	would stand,
087142	not
087143	by
087144	works
087145	but
087146	by
087147	
087148	his calling) –
087149	it was said to her,
087150	
087151	
087152	
087153	“The older
087154	will serve
087155	
087156	the younger,”
087157	just as
087158	it is written:
087159	
087160	“Jacob
087161	I loved,
087162	
087163	but
087164	Esau
087165	I hated.”
087166	What
087167	then?
087168	shall we say
087169	not!
087170	Is there injustice
087171	with
087172	
087173	
087174	God?
087175	Absolutely
087176	
087177	to Moses:
087178	For
087179	he says
087180	“I will have mercy
087181	on whom
087182	
087183	I have mercy,
087184	
087185	and I will have compassion
087186	on whom
087187	
087188	I have compassion.”
087189	So
087190	then,
087191	it does not
087192	
087193	depend on human desire
087194	or
087195	
087196	exertion,
087197	but
087198	
087199	who shows mercy.
087200	on God
087201	says
087202	For
087203	
087204	the scripture
087205	
087206	to Pharaoh:
087207	
087208	“For
087209	
087210	
087211	this very purpose I have raised
087212	you up,
087213	that
087214	I may demonstrate
087215	in you,
087216	
087217	
087218	my power
087219	
087220	
087221	and that
087222	may be proclaimed
087223	
087224	my name
087225	
087226	in
087227	all
087228	
087229	the earth.”
087230	So
087231	then,
087232	on whom
087233	he chooses to have mercy,
087234	God has mercy
087235	whom
087236	and
087237	he chooses to harden.
087238	he hardens
087239	You will say to me
087240	
087241	then,
087242	“Why
087243	
087244	does he still
087245	find fault?
087246	
087247	For
087248	his will?”
087249	
087250	who
087251	has ever resisted
087252	
087253	a mere human being –
087254	But
087255	
087256	who
087257	indeed are you –
087258	
087259	to talk back
087260	
087261	
087262	to God?
087263	say
087264	
087265	Does what is molded
087266	
087267	to the molder,
087268	“Why
087269	
087270	have you made me
087271	like this?”
087272	
087273	no
087274	Has
087275	right
087276	
087277	the potter
087278	
087279	of clay
087280	from
087281	
087282	
087283	the same lump
087284	to make
087285	one
087286	
087287	for
087288	special use
087289	vessel
087290	another
087291	and
087292	for
087293	ordinary use?
087294	what if
087295	But
087296	willing
087297	
087298	God,
087299	to demonstrate
087300	
087301	his wrath
087302	
087303	and to make known
087304	
087305	his power,
087306	
087307	has endured
087308	with
087309	much
087310	patience
087311	the objects
087312	of wrath
087313	prepared
087314	for
087315	destruction?
087316	
087317	And what if he is willing to
087318	make known
087319	
087320	the wealth
087321	
087322	of his glory
087323	
087324	on
087325	the objects
087326	of mercy
087327	that
087328	he has prepared beforehand
087329	for
087330	glory –
087331	even us, whom
087332	
087333	he has called,
087334	
087335	not
087336	only
087337	from
087338	the Jews
087339	but
087340	
087341	also from
087342	the Gentiles?
087343	As
087344	
087345	he also says in
087346	
087347	Hosea:
087348	
087349	“I will call
087350	
087351	those who were not
087352	my people,
087353	
087354	‘My people,’
087355	
087356	
087357	
087358	
087359	and I will call her who was unloved,
087360	‘My beloved.’”
087361	
087362	
087363	“And in
087364	
087365	the very place
087366	where
087367	it was said to them,
087368	
087369	‘You are not
087370	my people,’
087371	
087372	
087373	there
087374	they will be called
087375	‘sons
087376	God.’”
087377	of the living
087378	Isaiah
087379	And
087380	cries out
087381	on behalf of
087382	
087383	Israel,
087384	“Though
087385	are
087386	
087387	the number
087388	
087389	of the children
087390	of Israel
087391	as
087392	
087393	the sand
087394	
087395	of the sea,
087396	
087397	only the remnant
087398	will be saved,
087399	his sentence
087400	for
087401	completely
087402	
087403	and quickly.”
087404	will execute
087405	the Lord
087406	on
087407	
087408	the earth
087409	
087410	Just as
087411	predicted,
087412	Isaiah
087413	“If
087414	had not
087415	the Lord
087416	of Heaven’s Armies
087417	left us
087418	
087419	descendants,
087420	like
087421	Sodom,
087422	we would
087423	have become
087424	
087425	
087426	Gomorrah.”
087427	and we would
087428	have resembled
087429	What
087430	then? –
087431	shall we say
087432	
087433	that the Gentiles
087434	
087435	who did not
087436	pursue
087437	righteousness
087438	obtained
087439	it,
087440	a righteousness
087441	that is,
087442	
087443	that is by
087444	faith,
087445	Israel
087446	but
087447	even though pursuing
087448	a law
087449	of righteousness
087450	
087451	it.
087452	did not
087453	attain
087454	
087455	Why not?
087456	Because they pursued it
087457	not
087458	by
087459	faith
087460	but
087461	(as if it were possible)
087462	by
087463	works.
087464	They stumbled over
087465	
087466	stone,
087467	
087468	the stumbling
087469	just as
087470	it is written,
087471	“Look,
087472	I am laying
087473	in
087474	Zion
087475	a stone
087476	that will cause people to stumble
087477	
087478	and a rock
087479	that will make them fall,
087480	
087481	
087482	yet the one who believes
087483	in him
087484	
087485	will not
087486	be put to shame.”
087487	Brothers and sisters,
087488	
087489	
087490	desire
087491	
087492	my
087493	heart’s
087494	
087495	
087496	and prayer
087497	to
087498	
087499	God
087500	on behalf of
087501	
087502	my fellow Israelites is for
087503	their salvation.
087504	I can testify
087505	For
087506	
087507	
087508	zealous
087509	for God,
087510	that they are
087511	but
087512	their zeal is not
087513	in line with
087514	the truth.
087515	ignoring
087516	For
087517	
087518	
087519	that comes from God,
087520	the righteousness
087521	
087522	
087523	their own
087524	righteousness,
087525	and seeking
087526	instead to establish
087527	
087528	righteousness.
087529	
087530	to God’s
087531	they did not
087532	submit
087533	is the end
087534	For
087535	of the law,
087536	Christ
087537	with the result
087538	that there is righteousness
087539	for everyone
087540	
087541	who believes.
087542	Moses
087543	For
087544	writes
087545	
087546	about the righteousness
087547	
087548	that is by
087549	
087550	the law:
087551	
087552	
087553	who does
087554	
087555	“The one
087556	these things will live
087557	by them.”
087558	
087559	
087560	But
087561	that is by
087562	faith
087563	the righteousness
087564	
087565	says:
087566	“Do not
087567	say
087568	in
087569	
087570	your heart,
087571	
087572	‘Who
087573	will ascend
087574	into
087575	
087576	heaven?’”
087577	
087578	(that is,
087579	Christ down)
087580	to bring
087581	or
087582	“Who
087583	will descend
087584	into
087585	
087586	the abyss?”
087587	
087588	(that is,
087589	Christ
087590	up from
087591	the dead).
087592	to bring
087593	But
087594	what
087595	does it say?
087596	near you,
087597	
087598	
087599	“The word
087600	is
087601	in
087602	
087603	your mouth
087604	
087605	
087606	and in
087607	
087608	your heart”
087609	
087610	
087611	(that is,
087612	
087613	the word
087614	
087615	of faith
087616	that
087617	we preach),
087618	
087619	because if
087620	you confess
087621	with
087622	
087623	your mouth
087624	
087625	is Lord
087626	that Jesus
087627	
087628	and believe
087629	in
087630	
087631	your heart
087632	
087633	
087634	
087635	that God
087636	
087637	raised him
087638	from
087639	the dead,
087640	you will be saved.
087641	with the heart
087642	For
087643	one believes
087644	and thus has
087645	righteousness
087646	with the mouth
087647	and
087648	one confesses
087649	and thus has
087650	salvation.
087651	says,
087652	For
087653	
087654	the scripture
087655	“Everyone
087656	
087657	who believes
087658	in him
087659	
087660	will not
087661	be put to shame.”
087662	no
087663	For
087664	there is
087665	distinction
087666	between the Jew
087667	
087668	
087669	and the Greek,
087670	
087671	for
087672	
087673	the same Lord
087674	is Lord of all,
087675	who richly blesses
087676	
087677	all
087678	
087679	who call on him.
087680	
087681	everyone
087682	For
087683	who
087684	
087685	calls
087686	
087687	on the name
087688	of the Lord
087689	will be saved.
087690	How
087691	
087692	are they to call on
087693	
087694	one
087695	they have not
087696	believed in?
087697	how
087698	And
087699	are they to believe in
087700	one
087701	they have not
087702	heard of?
087703	how
087704	And
087705	are they to hear
087706	without
087707	someone preaching to them?
087708	how
087709	And
087710	are they to preach
087711	
087712	unless
087713	they are sent?
087714	As
087715	it is written,
087716	“How
087717	timely
087718	
087719	is the arrival
087720	
087721	of those who proclaim
087722	
087723	the good news.”
087724	But
087725	not
087726	all
087727	have obeyed
087728	
087729	the good news,
087730	Isaiah
087731	for
087732	says,
087733	“Lord,
087734	who
087735	has believed
087736	
087737	our report?”
087738	
087739	Consequently
087740	
087741	faith
087742	comes from
087743	what is heard,
087744	
087745	and
087746	what is heard
087747	comes through
087748	the preached word
087749	of Christ.
087750	But
087751	
087752	I ask,
087753	have they not
087754	heard?
087755	Yes, they have:
087756	to
087757	all
087758	
087759	the earth,
087760	has gone out
087761	
087762	Their voice
087763	
087764	
087765	to
087766	
087767	the ends
087768	
087769	of the world.
087770	
087771	and their words
087772	
087773	But
087774	again I ask,
087775	didn’t
087776	Israel
087777	
087778	understand?
087779	First
087780	Moses
087781	says,
087782	
087783	“I will make
087784	you jealous
087785	by those who are
087786	not
087787	a nation;
087788	
087789	nation
087790	with a senseless
087791	to anger.”
087792	I will provoke you
087793	Isaiah
087794	And
087795	is even bold enough
087796	
087797	to say,
087798	“I was found
087799	by
087800	
087801	
087802	those who did not
087803	seek me;
087804	well known
087805	I became
087806	
087807	
087808	to those who did not
087809	ask for me.”
087810	about
087811	But
087812	
087813	Israel
087814	he says,
087815	“All
087816	
087817	day
087818	long I held out
087819	
087820	my hands
087821	
087822	to
087823	people!”
087824	this disobedient
087825	
087826	and stubborn
087827	I ask,
087828	So
087829	has not
087830	rejected
087831	
087832	God
087833	
087834	his people,
087835	
087836	not!
087837	has he? Absolutely
087838	
087839	For
087840	
087841	an Israelite,
087842	I too am
087843	
087844	a descendant
087845	of Abraham,
087846	from the tribe
087847	of Benjamin.
087848	has not
087849	rejected
087850	
087851	God
087852	
087853	his people
087854	
087855	whom
087856	he foreknew!
087857	
087858	Do you not
087859	know
087860	about
087861	Elijah,
087862	what
087863	says
087864	
087865	the scripture
087866	how
087867	he pleads
087868	
087869	with God
087870	against
087871	
087872	Israel?
087873	“Lord,
087874	
087875	your prophets,
087876	
087877	they have killed
087878	
087879	your altars;
087880	
087881	they have demolished
087882	I
087883	am left
087884	alone
087885	
087886	and they are seeking
087887	
087888	my life!”
087889	
087890	But
087891	what
087892	
087893	
087894	
087895	was the divine response to him?
087896	“I have kept
087897	for myself
087898	seven thousand
087899	people
087900	who
087901	have not
087902	bent
087903	the knee
087904	
087905	to Baal.”
087906	in the same way
087907	So
087908	
087909	at
087910	
087911	the present
087912	time
087913	a remnant
087914	
087915	chosen
087916	by grace.
087917	there is
087918	if
087919	And
087920	it is by grace,
087921	it is no longer
087922	by
087923	works,
087924	otherwise
087925	
087926	grace
087927	no longer
087928	would
087929	be grace.
087930	What
087931	then?
087932	what
087933	it was diligently seeking,
087934	Israel
087935	
087936	failed
087937	to obtain
087938	
087939	but
087940	the elect
087941	obtained it.
087942	
087943	
087944	The rest
087945	were hardened,
087946	as
087947	it is written,
087948	gave them
087949	
087950	
087951	“God
087952	a spirit
087953	of stupor,
087954	eyes
087955	
087956	that would not
087957	see
087958	
087959	and ears
087960	
087961	that would not
087962	hear,
087963	to
087964	
087965	this very
087966	day.”
087967	
087968	And David
087969	says,
087970	become
087971	
087972	“Let their table
087973	
087974	
087975	a snare
087976	
087977	
087978	and trap,
087979	
087980	
087981	a stumbling block
087982	
087983	
087984	and a retribution for them;
087985	
087986	be darkened
087987	
087988	let their eyes
087989	
087990	
087991	so that they may not
087992	see,
087993	
087994	
087995	their backs bend
087996	
087997	
087998	continually.”
087999	and make
088000	I ask
088001	then,
088002	they did not
088003	stumble
088004	
088005	into an irrevocable fall,
088006	not!
088007	did they? Absolutely
088008	But
088009	
088010	
088011	by their transgression
088012	
088013	salvation
088014	
088015	the Gentiles,
088016	has come to
088017	
088018	jealous.
088019	to make Israel
088020	if
088021	Now
088022	
088023	their transgression
088024	
088025	means riches
088026	for the world
088027	
088028	
088029	and their defeat
088030	
088031	means riches
088032	for the Gentiles,
088033	how much
088034	more
088035	
088036	will their full restoration bring?
088037	
088038	
088039	Now
088040	I am speaking to you
088041	
088042	Gentiles.
088043	
088044	Seeing that
088045	
088046	
088047	I am
088048	
088049	to the Gentiles,
088050	an apostle
088051	
088052	my ministry,
088053	
088054	I magnify
088055	if
088056	somehow
088057	I could provoke
088058	
088059	
088060	my people to jealousy
088061	
088062	and save
088063	some
088064	of them.
088065	
088066	if
088067	For
088068	
088069	their rejection
088070	
088071	is the reconciliation
088072	of the world,
088073	what
088074	
088075	will their acceptance
088076	
088077	be but
088078	life
088079	from
088080	the dead?
088081	If
088082	
088083	the
088084	first portion of the dough offered
088085	is holy,
088086	
088087	
088088	then the whole batch is holy,
088089	
088090	and if
088091	
088092	the root
088093	is holy,
088094	so too
088095	are the
088096	branches.
088097	if
088098	Now
088099	some
088100	
088101	of the branches
088102	were broken off,
088103	
088104	and you,
088105	a wild olive shoot,
088106	were
088107	grafted in
088108	among them
088109	
088110	
088111	and participated in
088112	
088113	root,
088114	
088115	the richness
088116	
088117	of the olive
088118	
088119	do not
088120	boast over
088121	
088122	the branches.
088123	if
088124	But
088125	you boast, remember that you
088126	do not
088127	
088128	
088129	the root,
088130	support
088131	but
088132	
088133	the root supports you.
088134	
088135	you will say,
088136	Then
088137	were broken off
088138	“The branches
088139	so that
088140	
088141	I could be grafted in.”
088142	Granted!
088143	
088144	because of their unbelief,
088145	They were broken off
088146	
088147	but
088148	
088149	by faith.
088150	you stand
088151	Do not
088152	arrogant,
088153	be
088154	but
088155	fear!
088156	if
088157	For
088158	
088159	God
088160	
088161	
088162	the natural
088163	branches,
088164	did not
088165	
088166	spare
088167	perhaps
088168	he will not
088169	
088170	spare you.
088171	Notice
088172	therefore
088173	the kindness
088174	
088175	and harshness
088176	of God –
088177	toward
088178	
088179	
088180	those who have fallen,
088181	harshness
088182	toward you,
088183	but
088184	
088185	kindness
088186	God’s
088187	provided
088188	you continue
088189	
088190	in his kindness;
088191	otherwise
088192	
088193	
088194	you also will be cut off.
088195	even they –
088196	And
088197	if
088198	they do not
088199	continue
088200	
088201	in their unbelief –
088202	will be grafted in,
088203	able
088204	for
088205	is
088206	
088207	God
088208	again.
088209	to graft
088210	them in
088211	if
088212	For
088213	
088214	from
088215	
088216	what is by
088217	nature
088218	you were cut off
088219	a wild olive tree,
088220	
088221	contrary
088222	to nature,
088223	and grafted,
088224	into
088225	a cultivated olive tree,
088226	how much
088227	more
088228	
088229	
088230	
088231	will these natural
088232	branches be grafted back
088233	
088234	into their own
088235	olive tree?
088236	I do not
088237	For
088238	want
088239	
088240	you to be ignorant
088241	brothers and sisters,
088242	
088243	of this mystery,
088244	
088245	so that
088246	you may not
088247	be
088248	
088249	
088250	conceited:
088251	
088252	hardening
088253	
088254	A partial
088255	
088256	to Israel
088257	has happened
088258	until
088259	
088260	
088261	the full number
088262	
088263	of the Gentiles
088264	has come in.
088265	
088266	And so
088267	all
088268	Israel
088269	will be saved,
088270	as
088271	it is written:
088272	will come out
088273	of
088274	Zion;
088275	
088276	“The Deliverer
088277	he will remove
088278	ungodliness
088279	from
088280	Jacob.
088281	
088282	
088283	
088284	
088285	
088286	
088287	And this is my covenant with them,
088288	when
088289	I take away
088290	
088291	their sins.”
088292	
088293	In regard to
088294	
088295	
088296	the gospel
088297	they are enemies
088298	for
088299	your sake,
088300	in regard to
088301	but
088302	
088303	election
088304	they are dearly loved
088305	for the sake of
088306	
088307	the fathers.
088308	are irrevocable.
088309	For
088310	
088311	the gifts
088312	
088313	
088314	and the call
088315	
088316	of God
088317	Just as you
088318	
088319	
088320	were formerly
088321	disobedient
088322	
088323	to God,
088324	have now
088325	but
088326	received mercy
088327	
088328	
088329	due to their disobedience,
088330	so
088331	
088332	
088333	they too have now
088334	been disobedient
088335	
088336	shown to you,
088337	by the mercy
088338	in order that,
088339	
088340	
088341	they too may now
088342	receive mercy.
088343	has consigned
088344	For
088345	
088346	God
088347	
088348	all people
088349	
088350	to disobedience
088351	so that
088352	
088353	to them all.
088354	he may show mercy
088355	Oh,
088356	the depth
088357	of the riches
088358	
088359	and wisdom
088360	
088361	and knowledge
088362	of God!
088363	How
088364	unsearchable
088365	
088366	are his judgments
088367	
088368	
088369	and how unfathomable
088370	
088371	his ways!
088372	
088373	who
088374	For
088375	has known
088376	the mind
088377	of the Lord,
088378	or
088379	who
088380	his counselor?
088381	
088382	has been
088383	Or
088384	who
088385	has first given
088386	
088387	
088388	to God, that God needs to repay him?
088389	
088390	
088391	For from him
088392	
088393	
088394	and through him
088395	
088396	
088397	and to him
088398	
088399	
088400	are all things.
088401	
088402	
088403	To him be glory
088404	
088405	
088406	forever!
088407	Amen.
088408	I exhort you,
088409	Therefore
088410	
088411	brothers and sisters,
088412	by
088413	
088414	the mercies
088415	
088416	of God,
088417	to present
088418	
088419	your bodies
088420	
088421	as a sacrifice –
088422	alive,
088423	holy,
088424	and pleasing
088425	
088426	to God –
088427	
088428	which is your reasonable
088429	service.
088430	
088431	
088432	Do not
088433	be conformed
088434	
088435	to this present world,
088436	
088437	but
088438	be transformed
088439	
088440	by the renewing
088441	
088442	of your mind,
088443	so that
088444	
088445	you may test and approve
088446	
088447	what
088448	
088449	is the will
088450	
088451	of God –
088452	
088453	what is good
088454	
088455	and well-pleasing
088456	
088457	and perfect.
088458	I say
088459	For
088460	by
088461	
088462	the grace
088463	
088464	given to me
088465	
088466	to every one of you
088467	
088468	
088469	
088470	
088471	not
088472	to think more highly
088473	
088474	
088475	of yourself than you ought
088476	to think,
088477	but
088478	to think
088479	with
088480	
088481	sober discernment,
088482	to each
088483	as
088484	
088485	God
088486	has distributed
088487	of you a measure
088488	of faith.
088489	just as
088490	For
088491	in
088492	one
088493	body
088494	many
088495	members,
088496	we have
088497	
088498	and
088499	the members

089097	If
089098	
089099	
089100	we live,
089101	
089102	for the Lord;
089103	we live
089104	if
089105	
089106	we die,
089107	
089108	for the Lord.
089109	we die
089110	whether

089116	die,
089117	
089118	the Lord’s.
089119	we are
089120	
089121	
089122	For
089123	this reason Christ
089124	died
089125	
089126	and returned to life,
089127	so that
089128	
089129	of both the dead
089130	
089131	and the living.
089132	he may be the Lord
089133	you who eat vegetables only –
089134	But
089135	why
089136	do you judge
089137	
089138	your brother or sister?
089139	
089140	
089141	And
089142	you who eat everything –
089143	why
089144	do you despise
089145	
089146	your brother or sister?
089147	
089148	we will all
089149	For
089150	stand before
089151	
089152	the judgment seat
089153	
089154	of God.
089155	it is written,
089156	For
089157	“As I live,
089158	
089159	says
089160	the Lord,
089161

089171	to God.”
089172	
089173	Therefore,
089174	each of us
089175	
089176	of
089177	himself to God.
089178	an account
089179	will give
089180	
089181	
089182	we must not
089183	Therefore
089184	on one another,
089185	pass judgment
089186	but
089187	
089188	determine
089189	rather
089190	
089191	never
089192	to place
089193	an obstacle
089194	
089195	before a brother or sister.
089196	or
089197	a trap
089198	I know
089199	
089200	and am convinced
089201	in
089202	the Lord
089203	Jesus
089204	
089205	that there is nothing
089206	unclean
089207	in
089208	itself;
089209	
089210	still,
089211	
089212	who considers
089213	
089214	unclean
089215	it is
089216	to the one
089217	it unclean.
089218	if
089219	For
089220	because of
089221	what you eat,
089222	
089223	your brother or sister
089224	
089225	is distressed
089226	you are no longer
089227	in
089228	love.
089229	walking
089230	Do not
089231	
089232	by your food
089233	
089234	
089235	destroy
089236	someone for
089237	whom
089238	Christ
089239	died.
089240	do not let what you
089241	be spoken of as evil.
089242	Therefore
089243	
089244	
089245	consider good
089246	not
089247	For
089248	does
089249	
089250	the kingdom
089251	
089252	of God
089253	consist of food
089254	
089255	and drink,
089256	but
089257	righteousness,
089258	
089259	peace,
089260	
089261	and joy
089262	in
089263	Spirit.
089264	the Holy
089265	
089266	For
089267	in
089268	
089269	the one who serves
089270	
089271	Christ
089272	this way is pleasing
089273	
089274	to God
089275	
089276	and approved
089277	
089278	by people.
089279	So
089280	then,
089281	
089282	
089283	what makes for peace
089284	let us pursue
089285	
089286	
089287	
089288	and for building up
089289	
089290	
089291	one another.
089292	Do not
089293	for the sake of
089294	food.
089295	destroy
089296	
089297	the work
089298	
089299	of God
089300	all things
089301	
089302	are clean,
089303	For although
089304	it is wrong
089305	
089306	to cause anyone
089307	
089308	
089309	to stumble
089310	by what you eat.
089311	It is good
089312	
089313	not
089314	to eat
089315	meat
089316	or
089317	drink
089318	wine
089319	or
089320	
089321	to do anything that
089322	
089323	causes your brother
089324	
089325	to stumble.
089326	
089327	The faith
089328	what
089329	you have,
089330	to
089331	yourself
089332	keep
089333	before
089334	
089335	God.
089336	Blessed
089337	
089338	is the one who does not
089339	judge
089340	himself
089341	by
089342	
089343	he approves.
089344	
089345	But
089346	the man who doubts
089347	if
089348	he eats,
089349	is condemned
089350	
089351	because he does not
089352	do so from
089353	faith,
089354	
089355	and
089356	whatever is
089357	not
089358	from
089359	faith
089360	sin.
089361	is
089362	ought
089363	But
089364	
089365	
089366	we who are strong
089367	
089368	with the failings
089369	
089370	of the weak,
089371	to bear
089372	
089373	and not
089374	ourselves.
089375	just please
089376	Let each of us
089377	
089378	
089379	his neighbor
089380	please
089381	for
089382	
089383	his good
089384	to
089385	build him up.
089386	
089387	For
089388	
089389	even Christ
089390	did not
089391	himself,
089392	please
089393	but
089394	just as
089395	it is written,
089396	
089397	“The insults
089398	
089399	of those who insult
089400	
089401	you have fallen
089402	on me.”
089403	
089404	everything
089405	For
089406	that was written in former times
089407	for
089408	
089409	our
089410	instruction,
089411	was written
089412	so that
089413	through
089414	
089415	endurance
089416	
089417	and through
089418	
089419	encouragement
089420	
089421	of the scriptures
089422	
089423	hope.
089424	we may have
089425	
089426	Now
089427	may the God
089428	
089429	of endurance
089430	
089431	
089432	and comfort
089433	give
089434	
089435	
089436	
089437	you unity
089438	with
089439	one another
089440	in accordance with
089441	Christ
089442	Jesus,
089443	so that
089444	together
089445	you may with
089446	one
089447	voice
089448	glorify
089449	
089450	the God
089451	
089452	and Father
089453	
089454	of our Lord
089455	
089456	Jesus
089457	Christ.
089458	
089459	Receive
089460	one another,
089461	then, just as
089462	
089463	
089464	Christ
089465	also received you,
089466	
089467	to
089468	glory.
089469	
089470	God’s
089471	I tell
089472	For
089473	you that Christ
089474	a servant
089475	has become
089476	of the circumcised
089477	on behalf of
089478	truth
089479	God’s
089480	to
089481	
089482	confirm
089483	
089484	the promises
089485	
089486	made to the fathers,
089487	
089488	and
089489	thus the Gentiles
089490	for
089491	his mercy.
089492	glorify
089493	
089494	God
089495	As
089496	it is written,
089497	“Because of
089498	
089499	this I will confess you
089500	
089501	among
089502	the Gentiles,
089503	
089504	
089505	to your name.”
089506	
089507	and I will sing praises
089508	
089509	And again
089510	it says:
089511	“Rejoice,
089512	O Gentiles,
089513	with
089514	
089515	his people.”
089516	
089517	
089518	And again,
089519	“Praise
089520	all
089521	
089522	you Gentiles,
089523	
089524	the Lord
089525	
089526	praise him.”
089527	
089528	and let all
089529	
089530	the peoples
089531	
089532	And again
089533	Isaiah
089534	says,
089535	will come,
089536	
089537	“The root
089538	
089539	of Jesse
089540	
089541	
089542	and the one who rises
089543	to rule over
089544	the Gentiles,
089545	in him
089546	
089547	will the Gentiles
089548	hope.”
089549	
089550	Now
089551	may the God
089552	
089553	of hope
089554	fill you
089555	
089556	with all
089557	joy
089558	
089559	and peace
089560	as
089561	
089562	you believe
089563	in him, so that
089564	
089565	you may abound
089566	
089567	in
089568	
089569	hope
089570	by
089571	the power
089572	Spirit.
089573	of the Holy
089574	I myself am fully convinced
089575	But
089576	my brothers and sisters,
089577	
089578	
089579	
089580	
089581	about you,
089582	
089583	
089584	
089585	
089586	full
089587	that you yourselves are
089588	of goodness,
089589	filled
089590	with all
089591	
089592	knowledge,
089593	and able
089594	
089595	one another.
089596	to instruct
089597	more boldly to you
089598	But
089599	I have written
089600	
089601	on
089602	some points
089603	so as
089604	to remind you,
089605	
089606	because of
089607	
089608	the grace
089609	
089610	given to me
089611	
089612	by
089613	
089614	God
089615	to
089616	
089617	be
089618	
089619	a minister
089620	of Christ
089621	Jesus
089622	to
089623	
089624	the Gentiles.
089625	I serve
089626	
089627	the gospel
089628	
089629	of God like a priest,
089630	so that
089631	may become
089632	
089633	offering,
089634	
089635	the Gentiles
089636	an acceptable
089637	sanctified
089638	by
089639	Spirit.
089640	the Holy
089641	
089642	So
089643	
089644	I boast
089645	in
089646	Christ
089647	Jesus
089648	
089649	about the things that pertain to
089650	
089651	God.
089652	I will not
089653	For
089654	dare
089655	of anything
089656	to speak
089657	what
089658	except
089659	has accomplished
089660	Christ
089661	through me
089662	
089663	in order to
089664	bring about the obedience
089665	of the Gentiles,
089666	by word
089667	
089668	and deed,
089669	in
089670	the power
089671	of signs
089672	
089673	and wonders,
089674	in
089675	the power
089676	of the Spirit
089677	of God.
089678	So
089679	
089680	from
089681	Jerusalem
089682	
089683	
089684	even as far as
089685	
089686	Illyricum
089687	I have fully preached
089688	
089689	the gospel
089690	
089691	of Christ.
089692	in this way
089693	And
089694	I desire
089695	to preach
089696	has not
089697	where
089698	been named,
089699	Christ
089700	so
089701	as not
089702	on
089703	another person’s
089704	foundation,
089705	to build
089706	but
089707	as
089708	it is written:
089709	“Those who
089710	were not
089711	told
089712	about him
089713	
089714	will see,
089715	
089716	and those who
089717	have not
089718	heard
089719	will understand.”
089720	This is the reason
089721	
089722	hindered
089723	
089724	I was often
089725	
089726	from coming
089727	to you.
089728	
089729	now
089730	But
089731	
089732	there is nothing
089733	I have
089734	more to keep me in
089735	
089736	these regions,
089737	
089738	desired
089739	and
089740	
089741	
089742	to come
089743	to you
089744	
089745	for
089746	many
089747	years
089748	when
089749	
089750	I go
089751	to
089752	
089753	Spain.
089754	I hope
089755	For
089756	you when I pass through
089757	to visit
089758	
089759	and that
089760	
089761	you
089762	will help me on my journey
089763	there,
089764	after
089765	
089766	
089767	
089768	your company for a while.
089769	I have enjoyed
089770	now
089771	But
089772	I go
089773	to
089774	Jerusalem
089775	to minister
089776	to the
089777	saints.
089778	are pleased

089785	to make
089786	for
089787	
089788	the poor
089789	
089790	among the saints
089791	
089792	in
089793	Jerusalem.
089794	they were pleased to do this,
089795	For
089796	
089797	indebted
089798	and indeed they are
089799	
089800	if
089801	to the Jerusalem saints. For
089802	
089803	in their spiritual things,
089804	
089805	have shared
089806	
089807	the Gentiles
089808	they are obligated
089809

089811	
089812	material things.
089813	also to minister to them
089814	
089815	
089816	Therefore
089817	after I have completed
089818	
089819	this and have safely delivered
089820

089826	
089827	for

089829	I know
089830	and
089831

090614	to those who are perishing,
090615	foolishness
090616	is
090617	
090618	but to us
090619	who are being saved
090620	
090621	the power
090622	of God.
090623	it is
090624	it is written,
090625	For
090626	“I will destroy
090627	
090628	the wisdom
090629	
090630	of the wise,
090631	
090632	
090633	the cleverness
090634	
090635	of the intelligent.”
090636	and I will thwart
090637	Where
090638	is the wise man?
090639	Where
090640	is the expert in the Mosaic law?
090641	Where
090642	is the debater
090643	
090644	of this age?
090645	
090646	not made
090647	foolish?
090648	
090649	Has God
090650	
090651	the wisdom
090652	
090653	of the world
090654	since
090655	For
090656	in
090657	
090658	the wisdom
090659	
090660	of God
090661	did not
090662	know
090663	
090664	the world
090665	by
090666	
090667	its wisdom
090668	
090669	God,
090670	was pleased
090671	
090672	God
090673	by
090674	
090675	the foolishness
090676	
090677	of preaching.
090678	to save
090679	
090680	those who believe
090681	For
090682	
090683	Jews
090684	miraculous signs
090685	demand
090686	
090687	and Greeks
090688	wisdom,
090689	ask for
090690	
090691	but
090692	we preach
090693	Christ,
090694	about a crucified
090695	to Jews
090696	
090697	a stumbling block
090698	to Gentiles.
090699	and
090700	foolishness
090701	
090702	But
090703	
090704	to those who are called,
090705	Jews
090706	both
090707	
090708	and Greeks,
090709	Christ
090710	of God
090711	is the power
090712	
090713	of God.
090714	and the wisdom
090715	
090716	
090717	For the foolishness
090718	
090719	of God
090720	wiser
090721	
090722	than human wisdom,
090723	is
090724	
090725	
090726	and the weakness
090727	
090728	of God
090729	is stronger
090730	
090731	than human strength.
090732	Think about
090733	
090734	
090735	the circumstances of your call,
090736	
090737	brothers and sisters.
090738	
090739	Not
090740	many
090741	were wise
090742	by
090743	human standards,
090744	not
090745	many
090746	were powerful,
090747	not
090748	many
090749	were born to a privileged position.
090750	But
090751	
090752	thinks foolish
090753	
090754	what the world
090755	chose
090756	
090757	God
090758	to
090759	shame
090760	
090761	the wise,
090762	
090763	
090764	thinks weak
090765	
090766	what the world
090767	chose
090768	
090769	and God
090770	to
090771	shame
090772	
090773	the strong.
090774	
090775	
090776	what is low
090777	
090778	in the world,
090779	
090780	
090781	and despised
090782	chose
090783	
090784	God
090785	
090786	
090787	what is regarded as nothing,
090788	to
090789	
090790	what is regarded as something,
090791	set aside
090792	so that
090793	no
090794	can boast
090795	
090796	one
090797	presence.
090798	
090799	in his
090800	
090801	
090802	
090803	
090804	He is the reason you have a relationship
090805	with
090806	Christ
090807	Jesus,
090808	who
090809	became for us
090810	wisdom
090811	
090812	from
090813	God,
090814	righteousness
090815	and
090816	
090817	and sanctification
090818	
090819	and redemption,
090820	so that,
090821	as
090822	it is written,
090823	
090824	“Let the one who boasts,
090825	in
090826	the Lord.”
090827	boast
090828	When I
090829	came
090830	to you,
090831	
090832	brothers and sisters,
090833	come
090834	I did not
090835	with
090836	superior
090837	eloquence
090838	or
090839	wisdom
090840	as I proclaimed
090841	
090842	
090843	the testimony
090844	
090845	of God.
090846	about nothing
090847	For
090848	I decided
090849	
090850	to be concerned
090851	among you
090852	
090853	
090854	except
090855	Jesus
090856	Christ,
090857	
090858	
090859	and him crucified.
090860	And I
090861	in
090862	weakness
090863	
090864	and in
090865	fear
090866	
090867	and with
090868	trembling.
090869	much
090870	was
090871	with you
090872	
090873	
090874	
090875	My conversation
090876	
090877	
090878	
090879	and my preaching
090880	
090881	were not
090882	with
090883	persuasive
090884	of wisdom,
090885	words
090886	but
090887	with
090888	a demonstration
090889	of the Spirit
090890	
090891	and of power,
090892	so that
090893	
090894	your faith
090895	
090896	would not
090897	be
090898	based on
090899	wisdom
090900	human
090901	but
090902	on
090903	the power
090904	of God.
090905	wisdom
090906	Now
090907	we do speak
090908	among
090909	
090910	the mature,
090911	a wisdom
090912	but
090913	not
090914	
090915	of this age
090916	
090917	or
090918	
090919	of the rulers
090920	
090921	of this age,
090922	
090923	
090924	who are perishing.
090925	Instead
090926	we speak
090927	of God,
090928	the wisdom
090929	in
090930	a mystery,
090931	
090932	hidden
090933	that
090934	determined
090935	
090936	God
090937	before
090938	
090939	the ages
090940	for
090941	our glory.
090942	
090943	
090944	None
090945	
090946	of the rulers
090947	
090948	of this age
090949	
090950	understood
090951	it. If
090952	
090953	they had known
090954	it, they would not
090955	
090956	
090957	the Lord
090958	
090959	of glory.
090960	have crucified
090961	But
090962	just as
090963	it is written,
090964	“Things that
090965	eye
090966	no
090967	has seen,
090968	
090969	or ear
090970	
090971	heard,
090972	
090973	
090974	or mind
090975	
090976	
090977	imagined,
090978	are the things
090979	has prepared
090980	
090981	God
090982	
090983	for those who love him.”
090984	
090985	
090986	For
090987	has revealed these to us
090988	
090989	God
090990	by
090991	
090992	the Spirit.
090993	
090994	
090995	the Spirit
090996	all things,
090997	searches
090998	
090999	
091000	even the deep things
091001	
091002	of God.
091003	who
091004	For
091005	knows
091006	among men
091007	
091008	
091009	the things of a man
091010	
091011	except
091012	
091013	spirit
091014	
091015	the man’s
091016	
091017	within him?
091018	
091019	So
091020	
091021	
091022	
091023	the things of God
091024	too, no one
091025	knows
091026	
091027	except
091028	
091029	the Spirit
091030	
091031	of God.
091032	
091033	Now
091034	we have not
091035	
091036	the spirit
091037	
091038	of the world,
091039	received
091040	but
091041	
091042	the Spirit
091043	
091044	who is from
091045	
091046	God,
091047	so that
091048	we may know
091049	
091050	by
091051	
091052	God.
091053	the things that are freely given to us
091054	
091055	about these things,
091056	
091057	And we speak
091058	not
091059	with
091060	taught
091061	us by human
091062	wisdom,
091063	words
091064	but
091065	with
091066	those taught
091067	by the Spirit,
091068	spiritual things
091069	to spiritual people.
091070	explaining
091071	
091072	
091073	The unbeliever
091074	does not
091075	receive
091076	
091077	
091078	the things of the Spirit
091079	
091080	of God,
091081	they are foolishness to him.
091082	for
091083	
091084	
091085	
091086	
091087	And he cannot
091088	understand
091089	
091090	them, because they are spiritually
091091	discerned.
091092	
091093	
091094	The one who is spiritual
091095	discerns
091096	
091097	all things,
091098	
091099	yet he himself
091100	by
091101	no one.
091102	is understood
091103	who
091104	For
091105	has known
091106	the mind
091107	of the Lord,
091108	
091109	so as to advise him?
091110	
091111	
091112	But
091113	the mind
091114	of Christ.
091115	we have
091116	So,
091117	brothers and sisters,
091118	not
091119	I could
091120	speak to you
091121	
091122	as
091123	spiritual people,
091124	but instead
091125	as
091126	people of the flesh,
091127	as
091128	infants
091129	in
091130	Christ.
091131	milk,
091132	
091133	I fed you
091134	not
091135	solid food,
091136	you were not yet
091137	for
091138	ready.
091139	In fact,
091140	not
091141	you are still
091142	
091143	ready,
091144	still
091145	for
091146	influenced by the flesh.
091147	you are
091148	since
091149	For
091150	among
091151	you,
091152	there is still jealousy
091153	
091154	and dissension
091155	not
091156	influenced by the flesh
091157	are you
091158	
091159	like
091160	unregenerate people?
091161	and behaving
091162	whenever
091163	For
091164	says,
091165	someone
091166	
091167	
091168	“I am
091169	with Paul,”
091170	
091171	or
091172	
091173	with Apollos,”
091174	are you not
091175	merely human?
091176	“I am
091177	What
091178	
091179	is
091180	Apollos,
091181	what
091182	really? Or
091183	is
091184	Paul?
091185	Servants
091186	through
091187	whom
091188	you came to believe,
091189	
091190	and each
091191	
091192	
091193	of us in the ministry the Lord
091194	gave us.
091195	
091196	I planted,
091197	Apollos
091198	watered,
091199	but
091200	
091201	God
091202	caused it to grow.
091203	So
091204	neither
091205	
091206	the one who plants
091207	counts
091208	for anything,
091209	nor
091210	
091211	the one who waters,
091212	but
091213	
091214	who causes the growth.
091215	God
091216	
091217	The one who plants
091218	
091219	
091220	
091221	and the one who waters
091222	one,
091223	work as
091224	each
091225	but
091226	
091227	his
091228	reward
091229	will receive
091230	according
091231	
091232	to his
091233	work.
091234	belonging to God.
091235	
091236	We are
091237	coworkers
091238	God’s
091239	field,
091240	God’s
091241	building.
091242	You are
091243	According to
091244	
091245	the grace
091246	
091247	of God
091248	
091249	given to me,
091250	
091251	like
091252	a skilled
091253	master-builder
091254	a foundation,
091255	I laid
091256	someone else
091257	but
091258	builds
091259	each one
091260	on it. And
091261	must be careful
091262	how
091263	he builds.
091264	any foundation
091265	For
091266	other
091267	no one
091268	can
091269	lay
091270	than
091271	
091272	what is being laid,
091273	which
091274	is
091275	Jesus
091276	Christ.
091277	If
091278	
091279	anyone
091280	builds
091281	on
091282	
091283	the foundation
091284	with gold,
091285	silver,
091286	stones,
091287	precious
091288	wood,
091289	hay,
091290	or straw,
091291	each
091292	
091293	builder’s work
091294	plainly seen,
091295	will be
091296	
091297	for
091298	the Day
091299	will make it clear,
091300	
091301	by
091302	fire.
091303	because it will be revealed
091304	
091305	each
091306	
091307	of work
091308	what kind
091309	has done.
091310	
091311	And the fire
091312	
091313	will test
091314	If
091315	someone
091316	
091317	
091318	survives,
091319	what
091320	has built
091321	a reward.
091322	he will receive
091323	If
091324	someone’s
091325	
091326	work
091327	is burned up,
091328	he will suffer loss. He himself
091329	
091330	
091331	will be saved,
091332	only
091333	but
091334	as
091335	through
091336	fire.
091337	Do you not
091338	know
091339	
091340	temple
091341	God’s
091342	that you are
091343	
091344	
091345	Spirit
091346	
091347	and that God’s
091348	lives
091349	in you?
091350	
091351	If
091352	someone
091353	
091354	temple,
091355	
091356	God’s
091357	destroys
091358	will destroy
091359	
091360	
091361	God
091362	
091363	him. For
091364	temple
091365	
091366	God’s
091367	holy,
091368	is
091369	which
091370	is
091371	what you are.
091372	
091373	Guard against self-
091374	deception,
091375	each of you. If
091376	someone
091377	you thinks
091378	wise
091379	he is
091380	among
091381	
091382	in
091383	
091384	this age,
091385	
091386	foolish
091387	let him become
091388	so that
091389	he can become
091390	wise.
091391	
091392	For
091393	the wisdom
091394	
091395	of this age
091396	
091397	foolishness
091398	with
091399	
091400	God.
091401	is
091402	As it is written,
091403	
091404	
091405	“He catches
091406	
091407	the wise
091408	in
091409	
091410	their craftiness.”
091411	
091412	
091413	And again,
091414	“The Lord
091415	knows
091416	
091417	that the thoughts
091418	
091419	of the wise
091420	
091421	are
091422	futile.”
091423	So then,
091424	no more
091425	boasting
091426	about
091427	mere mortals!
091428	everything
091429	For
091430	
091431	belongs to you,
091432	whether
091433	Paul
091434	or
091435	Apollos
091436	or
091437	Cephas
091438	or
091439	the world
091440	or
091441	life
091442	or
091443	death
091444	or
091445	the present
091446	or
091447	the future.
091448	Everything belongs to you,
091449	
091450	
091451	and you
091452	belong to Christ,
091453	Christ
091454	and
091455	belongs to God.
091456	this way –
091457	
091458	One should think about us
091459	
091460	as
091461	servants
091462	of Christ
091463	
091464	and stewards
091465	of the mysteries
091466	of God.
091467	
091468	Now
091469	what is sought
091470	in
091471	
091472	stewards
091473	is that
091474	faithful.
091475	one
091476	be found
091477	
091478	So for me,
091479	
091480	a minor matter
091481	it is
091482	that
091483	by you
091484	
091485	I am judged
091486	or
091487	by
091488	any human
091489	court.
091490	In fact,
091491	I do not even
091492	myself.
091493	judge
091494	I am not
091495	For
091496	against myself,
091497	aware of anything
091498	but
091499	I am not
091500	because of
091501	this.
091502	acquitted
091503	The one who
091504	
091505	judges me
091506	
091507	the Lord.
091508	is
091509	So then,
091510	do not
091511	before
091512	the time.
091513	anything
091514	judge
091515	Wait until
091516	
091517	comes.
091518	
091519	the Lord
091520	
091521	
091522	He will bring to light
091523	
091524	the hidden things
091525	
091526	of darkness
091527	
091528	and reveal
091529	
091530	the motives
091531	
091532	of hearts.
091533	
091534	Then
091535	
091536	recognition
091537	will receive
091538	each
091539	from
091540	
091541	God.
091542	
091543	
091544	brothers and sisters,
091545	I have applied
091546	these things to
091547	myself
091548	
091549	and Apollos
091550	because of you,
091551	
091552	so that
091553	through us
091554	
091555	you may learn
091556	
091557	“not
091558	to go beyond
091559	what
091560	is written,”
091561	
091562	so that
091563	none
091564	in favor of
091565	
091566	the one
091567	of you will be puffed up
091568	against
091569	
091570	the other.
091571	who
091572	For
091573	you any superiority?
091574	concedes
091575	What
091576	
091577	do you have
091578	that
091579	you did not
091580	receive?
091581	if
091582	And
091583	
091584	you received
091585	it, why
091586	do you boast
091587	as though
091588	you did not?
091589	
091590	Already
091591	satisfied!
091592	you are
091593	Already
091594	you are rich!
091595	without us!
091596	
091597	You have become kings
091598	
091599	I wish
091600	
091601	you had become kings
091602	so that
091603	
091604	
091605	
091606	we could reign with you!
091607	I think,
091608	For,
091609	
091610	God
091611	
091612	
091613	apostles
091614	last
091615	has exhibited us
091616	of all, as
091617	men condemned to die,
091618	
091619	a spectacle
091620	because we have become
091621	
091622	to the world,
091623	
091624	both to angels
091625	
091626	and to people.
091627	
091628	We are fools
091629	for
091630	Christ,
091631	
091632	but you
091633	are wise
091634	in
091635	Christ!
091636	
091637	We are weak,
091638	
091639	but you
091640	are strong!
091641	
091642	You are distinguished,
091643	
091644	
091645	we are dishonored!
091646	To
091647	
091648	the present
091649	hour
091650	
091651	we are hungry
091652	
091653	and thirsty,
091654	
091655	poorly clothed,
091656	
091657	brutally treated,
091658	
091659	and without a roof over our heads.
091660	
091661	We do hard work,
091662	toiling
091663	
091664	with our own
091665	hands.
091666	When we are verbally abused,
091667	we respond with a blessing,
091668	when persecuted,
091669	we endure,
091670	when people lie about us,
091671	we answer in a friendly manner.
091672	
091673	dirt
091674	
091675	the world’s
091676	We are
091677	
091678	and scum,
091679	even
091680	now.
091681	I am not
091682	these things to shame you,
091683	
091684	writing
091685	
091686	but
091687	as
091688	children.
091689	
091690	my dear
091691	to correct you
091692	though
091693	For
091694	ten thousand
091695	guardians
091696	you may have
091697	in
091698	Christ,
091699	
091700	you do not
091701	have many
091702	fathers,
091703	in
091704	because
091705	Christ
091706	Jesus
091707	through
091708	
091709	the gospel.
091710	
091711	your father
091712	I became
091713	I encourage you,
091714	then,
091715	
091716	imitators of me.
091717	
091718	be
091719	For
091720	
091721	this reason, I have sent
091722	
091723	Timothy to you,
091724	who
091725	is
091726	
091727	son
091728	my dear
091729	
091730	and faithful
091731	in
091732	the Lord.
091733	He
091734	
091735	will remind you
091736	
091737	of my ways
091738	
091739	
091740	in
091741	Christ,
091742	
091743	as
091744	them everywhere
091745	in
091746	every
091747	church.
091748	I teach
091749	as
091750	if I were not
091751	coming
091752	
091753	
091754	to you.
091755	
091756	have become arrogant,
091757	Some
091758	I will come
091759	But
091760	soon,
091761	to you
091762	
091763	if
091764	
091765	the Lord
091766	is willing,
091767	
091768	and I will find out
091769	not
091770	
091771	only the talk
091772	
091773	of these arrogant people,
091774	but
091775	
091776	also their power.
091777	is demonstrated not
091778	For
091779	in
091780	idle talk
091781	
091782	the kingdom
091783	
091784	of God
091785	but
091786	with
091787	power.
091788	What
091789	do you want?
091790	with
091791	a rod
091792	Shall I come
091793	to you
091794	
091795	of discipline or
091796	with
091797	love
091798	a spirit
091799	and
091800	of gentleness?
091801	It is actually
091802	reported
091803	exists among you,
091804	
091805	that sexual immorality
091806	
091807	the kind
091808	of immorality
091809	that
091810	is not permitted even
091811	among
091812	
091813	the Gentiles,
091814	so that
091815	wife.
091816	someone
091817	
091818	with his father’s
091819	is cohabiting
091820	
091821	
091822	proud!
091823	And you are
091824	
091825	Shouldn’t
091826	instead
091827	you have been deeply sorrowful
091828	and
091829	removed
091830	this from
091831	among you?
091832	
091833	
091834	
091835	
091836	
091837	the one who did
091838	
091839	even
091840	For
091841	though I am absent
091842	
091843	physically,
091844	I am present
091845	
091846	
091847	in spirit.
091848	And I have already
091849	judged
091850	just as
091851	though I were present.
091852	
091853	
091854	
091855	the one who did this,
091856	in
091857	
091858	the name
091859	
091860	of our Lord
091861	
091862	Jesus,
091863	When you gather together
091864	
091865	
091866	
091867	and I
091868	am with you in spirit,
091869	along with
091870	
091871	the power
091872	
091873	of our Lord
091874	
091875	Jesus,
091876	hand
091877	
091878	this man over
091879	
091880	to Satan
091881	for
091882	the destruction
091883	
091884	of the flesh,
091885	so that
091886	
091887	his spirit
091888	may be saved
091889	in
091890	
091891	the day
091892	
091893	of the Lord.
091894	is not
091895	good.
091896	
091897	Your boasting
091898	
091899	Don’t
091900	you know
091901	
091902	that a little
091903	yeast
091904	the whole
091905	
091906	batch of dough?
091907	affects
091908	Clean out
091909	
091910	the old
091911	yeast
091912	so that
091913	you may be
091914	a new
091915	batch of dough –
091916	in fact,
091917	you are,
091918	without yeast.
091919	
091920	For
091921	
091922	our Passover lamb,
091923	
091924	has been sacrificed.
091925	Christ,
091926	So then,
091927	let us celebrate the festival,
091928	not
091929	with
091930	yeast,
091931	the old
091932	
091933	with
091934	the yeast
091935	of vice
091936	
091937	and evil,
091938	but
091939	
091940	the bread without yeast,
091941	the bread of sincerity
091942	
091943	and truth.
091944	I wrote you
091945	
091946	in
091947	
091948	my letter
091949	not
091950	to associate with
091951	sexually immoral people.
091952	In no way
091953	
091954	
091955	did I mean the immoral people
091956	
091957	of this world,
091958	
091959	or
091960	
091961	the greedy
091962	and
091963	swindlers
091964	and
091965	idolaters,
091966	since
091967	you would
091968	then
091969	of
091970	
091971	the world.
091972	have to go out
091973	now
091974	But
091975	I am writing to you
091976	
091977	not
091978	to associate with
091979	
091980	anyone
091981	himself a Christian
091982	who calls
091983	who is
091984	sexually immoral,
091985	or
091986	greedy,
091987	or
091988	an idolater,
091989	or
091990	verbally abusive,
091991	or
091992	a drunkard,
091993	or
091994	a swindler.
091995	
091996	such a person.
091997	Do not even
091998	eat with
091999	what
092000	For
092001	
092002	
092003	those outside?
092004	do I have to do with judging
092005	Are you not
092006	
092007	those inside?
092008	
092009	to judge
092010	
092011	But
092012	those outside.
092013	
092014	God
092015	will judge
092016	Remove
092017	
092018	the evil person
092019	from among
092020	you.
092021	
092022	does he dare
092023	When any
092024	
092025	a legal dispute
092026	of you has
092027	with
092028	
092029	another,
092030	go to court
092031	before
092032	
092033	the unrighteous
092034	
092035	rather than
092036	before
092037	
092038	the saints?
092039	Or
092040	do you not
092041	know
092042	
092043	
092044	that the saints
092045	
092046	the world?
092047	will judge
092048	
092049	And if
092050	by you,
092051	
092052	is to be judged
092053	
092054	the world
092055	you not competent
092056	are
092057	to settle
092058	trivial suits?
092059	Do you not
092060	know
092061	
092062	angels?
092063	that we will judge
092064	Why not
092065	
092066	ordinary matters!
092067	ordinary
092068	
092069	So
092070	lawsuits,
092071	if
092072	you have
092073	those who
092074	have no standing
092075	in
092076	
092077	the church?
092078	
092079	do you appoint as judges
092080	to
092081	your shame!
092082	
092083	I say
092084	this
092085	Is there no
092086	one
092087	among you
092088	
092089	
092090	wise
092091	
092092	
092093	enough to settle disputes
092094	
092095	between
092096	
092097	fellow Christians?
092098	
092099	Instead,
092100	does a Christian
092101	
092102	a Christian,
092103	sue
092104	
092105	
092106	and do this before
092107	unbelievers?
092108	demonstrates that you have already
092109	
092110	
092111	
092112	been defeated.
092113	
092114	
092115	
092116	lawsuits
092117	The fact that you have
092118	among
092119	yourselves
092120	
092121	Why
092122	not
092123	rather
092124	be wronged?
092125	
092126	Why
092127	not
092128	rather
092129	be cheated?
092130	But
092131	
092132	you yourselves wrong
092133	
092134	and cheat,
092135	
092136	
092137	and you do this to your brothers and sisters!
092138	
092139	Do you not
092140	know
092141	
092142	that the unrighteous
092143	of God?
092144	the kingdom
092145	will not
092146	inherit
092147	Do not
092148	be deceived!
092149	
092150	The sexually immoral,
092151	
092152	idolaters,
092153	
092154	adulterers,
092155	
092156	passive homosexual partners,
092157	
092158	practicing homosexuals,
092159	
092160	thieves,
092161	
092162	the greedy,
092163	will not
092164	drunkards,
092165	
092166	the verbally abusive,
092167	
092168	and swindlers
092169	the kingdom
092170	of God.
092171	inherit
092172	
092173	
092174	Some
092175	of you once lived
092176	this way. But
092177	you were washed,
092178	
092179	you were sanctified,
092180	
092181	you were justified
092182	in
092183	
092184	the name
092185	
092186	of the Lord
092187	Jesus
092188	Christ
092189	
092190	and by
092191	
092192	the Spirit
092193	
092194	of our God.
092195	
092196	“All things
092197	
092198	are lawful for me” –
092199	but
092200	not
092201	everything
092202	is beneficial.
092203	“All things
092204	
092205	are lawful for me” –
092206	but
092207	I will not
092208	
092209	be controlled
092210	by
092211	anything.
092212	
092213	“Food
092214	
092215	is for the stomach
092216	
092217	
092218	and the stomach
092219	
092220	is for food,
092221	
092222	but
092223	God
092224	
092225	
092226	
092227	
092228	will do away with both.”
092229	
092230	
092231	The body
092232	is not
092233	
092234	for sexual immorality,
092235	but
092236	
092237	for the Lord,
092238	
092239	
092240	and the Lord
092241	
092242	for the body.
092243	
092244	Now
092245	God
092246	
092247	
092248	the Lord
092249	indeed raised
092250	
092251	
092252	and he will raise us
092253	by
092254	
092255	his power.
092256	
092257	Do you not
092258	know
092259	
092260	
092261	that your bodies
092262	
092263	members
092264	of Christ?
092265	are
092266	Should I take
092267	
092268	
092269	the members
092270	
092271	of Christ
092272	and make
092273	of a prostitute?
092274	
092275	them members
092276	Never!
092277	Or
092278	do you not
092279	know
092280	
092281	
092282	that anyone who is united
092283	
092284	with a prostitute
092285	one
092286	body
092287	is
092288	it is
092289	with her? For
092290	said,
092291	
092292	“The two
092293	will become
092294	flesh.”
092295	one
092296	
092297	But
092298	the one united
092299	
092300	with the Lord
092301	one
092302	spirit with him.
092303	is
092304	Flee
092305	
092306	sexual immorality!
092307	“Every
092308	sin
092309	
092310	
092311	commits
092312	a person
092313	outside
092314	
092315	of the body” –
092316	is
092317	
092318	but
092319	the immoral person
092320	against
092321	
092322	his own
092323	body.
092324	sins
092325	Or
092326	do you not
092327	know
092328	
092329	
092330	that your body
092331	
092332	is the temple
092333	
092334	in you,
092335	
092336	of the Holy
092337	Spirit
092338	who is
092339	whom
092340	you have
092341	from
092342	God,
092343	
092344	not
092345	and you are
092346	your own?
092347	you were bought
092348	For
092349	at a price.
092350	glorify
092351	Therefore
092352	
092353	God
092354	with
092355	
092356	your body.
092357	
092358	with regard to
092359	Now
092360	the issues
092361	you wrote
092362	about: “It is good
092363	for a man
092364	a woman.”
092365	not
092366	to have sexual relations with
092367	because of
092368	But
092369	
092370	immoralities,
092371	each man
092372	his own
092373	
092374	wife
092375	should have relations with
092376	
092377	and each woman
092378	
092379	with her own
092380	husband.
092381	
092382	
092383	to his wife,
092384	
092385	A husband
092386	
092387	his marital responsibility
092388	should fulfill
092389	and likewise
092390	
092391	
092392	
092393	a wife
092394	
092395	to her husband.
092396	the
092397	wife
092398	
092399	to her own
092400	body,
092401	It is not
092402	who has the rights
092403	but
092404	the
092405	husband.
092406	In the same way,
092407	
092408	
092409	the
092410	husband
092411	
092412	to his own
092413	body,
092414	it is not
092415	who has the rights
092416	but
092417	
092418	the wife.
092419	Do not
092420	deprive
092421	each other,
092422	
092423	except
092424	
092425	by
092426	mutual agreement
092427	for
092428	a specified time,
092429	so that
092430	you may devote
092431	
092432	yourselves to prayer.
092433	
092434	Then resume
092435	
092436	
092437	
092438	
092439	your relationship, so that
092440	may not
092441	tempt you
092442	
092443	
092444	Satan
092445	because of
092446	
092447	your lack of self-control.
092448	
092449	
092450	
092451	I say
092452	this as
092453	a concession,
092454	not
092455	as
092456	a command.
092457	I wish
092458	
092459	
092460	that everyone
092461	was
092462	as
092463	
092464	I am.
092465	But
092466	each
092467	his own
092468	has
092469	gift
092470	from
092471	God,
092472	
092473	one
092474	this way,
092475	
092476	
092477	another that.
092478	I say
092479	
092480	
092481	To the unmarried
092482	
092483	
092484	and widows
092485	that it is best for them
092486	
092487	
092488	to remain
092489	as
092490	I am.
092491	if
092492	But
092493	they do not
092494	have self-control,
092495	let them get married.
092496	better
092497	For
092498	it is
092499	to marry
092500	than
092501	to burn with sexual desire.
092502	
092503	
092504	To the married
092505	I give this command –
092506	not
092507	
092508	I, but
092509	
092510	the Lord –
092511	a wife
092512	
092513	a husband
092514	should not
092515	divorce
092516	if
092517	(but
092518	
092519	
092520	she does, let her remain
092521	unmarried,
092522	or
092523	
092524	to her husband),
092525	be reconciled
092526	
092527	and a husband
092528	his wife.
092529	should not
092530	divorce
092531	
092532	
092533	To the rest
092534	I say –
092535	
092536	I, not
092537	
092538	the Lord –
092539	if
092540	
092541	a brother
092542	a wife
092543	has
092544	who is not a believer
092545	
092546	
092547	and she is happy
092548	to live
092549	with him,
092550	
092551	he should not
092552	divorce her.
092553	
092554	
092555	a woman
092556	And if
092557	
092558	has
092559	a husband
092560	who is not a believer
092561	
092562	
092563	and he is happy
092564	to live
092565	with her,
092566	
092567	she should not
092568	divorce
092569	
092570	him.
092571	is sanctified
092572	For
092573	
092574	husband
092575	
092576	the unbelieving
092577	because of
092578	
092579	the wife,
092580	
092581	
092582	
092583	wife
092584	
092585	and the unbelieving
092586	because of
092587	
092588	her husband.
092589	
092590	Otherwise
092591	
092592	your children
092593	
092594	unclean,
092595	are
092596	now
092597	but
092598	holy.
092599	they are
092600	if
092601	But
092602	
092603	the unbeliever
092604	wants a divorce,
092605	let it take place.
092606	is not
092607	bound.
092608	
092609	the brother
092610	or
092611	
092612	sister
092613	In
092614	
092615	these circumstances
092616	in
092617	
092618	peace.
092619	has called you
092620	
092621	
092622	God
092623	how
092624	For
092625	do you know,
092626	wife,
092627	whether
092628	
092629	you will bring your husband
092630	to salvation?
092631	Or
092632	how
092633	do you know,
092634	husband,
092635	whether
092636	
092637	you will bring your wife
092638	to salvation?
092639	
092640	Nevertheless,
092641	to each one,
092642	as
092643	has assigned
092644	
092645	the Lord
092646	
092647	as
092648	has called
092649	
092650	God
092651	each person, so
092652	must he live.
092653	
092654	
092655	in
092656	the
092657	churches.
092658	all
092659	I give this sort of direction
092660	after he had been circumcised?
092661	Was anyone
092662	called
092663	He should not
092664	try to undo his circumcision.
092665	
092666	who is uncircumcised?
092667	called
092668	Was anyone
092669	He should not
092670	get circumcised.
092671	
092672	Circumcision
092673	nothing
092674	is
092675	
092676	
092677	and uncircumcision
092678	nothing.
092679	is
092680	Instead,
092681	keeping
092682	commandments is what counts.
092683	God’s
092684	Let each one
092685	in
092686	
092687	that situation in life
092688	which
092689	he was called.
092690	in
092691	
092692	remain
092693	as a slave?
092694	Were you called
092695	Do not
092696	
092697	worry
092698	about it. But
092699	if
092700	
092701	indeed you are able
092702	free,
092703	to be
092704	make the most
092705	of the opportunity.
092706	
092707	For
092708	in
092709	the Lord
092710	the one who was called
092711	as a slave
092712	freedman.
092713	the Lord’s
092714	is
092715	In the same way,
092716	
092717	as a free person
092718	the one who was called
092719	slave.
092720	is
092721	Christ’s
092722	with a price.
092723	You were bought
092724	Do not
092725	become
092726	slaves
092727	of men.
092728	someone
092729	In
092730	whatever situation
092731	was called,
092732	brothers and sisters,
092733	in
092734	
092735	let him remain
092736	it with
092737	God.
092738	With regard to the question about
092739	
092740	
092741	people who have never married,
092742	command
092743	from the Lord,
092744	no
092745	I have
092746	my opinion
092747	but
092748	I give
092749	as
092750	one shown mercy
092751	by
092752	the Lord
092753	trustworthy.
092754	to be
092755	I think
092756	
092757	
092758	it best
092759	for you to remain
092760	Because of
092761	
092762	the impending
092763	crisis
092764	
092765	
092766	
092767	
092768	
092769	as you are.
092770	The one bound
092771	to a wife
092772	should not
092773	seek
092774	divorce.
092775	The one released
092776	from
092777	a wife
092778	should not
092779	seek
092780	marriage.
092781	if
092782	But
092783	
092784	you marry,
092785	you have not
092786	sinned.
092787	
092788	And if
092789	marries,
092790	
092791	a virgin
092792	she has not
092793	sinned.
092794	difficult circumstances,
092795	But
092796	
092797	
092798	will face
092799	
092800	those who marry
092801	
092802	
092803	
092804	and I am trying to spare you such problems.
092805	
092806	And
092807	I say this,
092808	brothers and sisters:
092809	
092810	The time
092811	short.
092812	is
092813	
092814	So then
092815	
092816	
092817	those
092818	who have
092819	wives
092820	as
092821	none,
092822	those who have
092823	should be
092824	
092825	
092826	those with tears
092827	like
092828	those not
092829	weeping,
092830	
092831	
092832	those who rejoice
092833	like
092834	those not
092835	rejoicing,
092836	
092837	
092838	those who buy
092839	like
092840	those without
092841	possessions,
092842	
092843	
092844	those who use
092845	
092846	the world
092847	as
092848	though they were not
092849	using it to the full.
092850	is passing away.
092851	For
092852	
092853	the present shape
092854	
092855	of this world
092856	
092857	I want
092858	And
092859	
092860	free from concern.
092861	you to be
092862	
092863	An unmarried man
092864	is concerned
092865	
092866	
092867	about the things of the Lord,
092868	how
092869	to please
092870	
092871	the Lord.
092872	
092873	But
092874	a married man
092875	is concerned
092876	
092877	
092878	about the things of the world,
092879	how
092880	to please
092881	
092882	his wife,
092883	
092884	and he is divided.

092888	
092889	An unmarried
092890	
092891	
092892	or a virgin
092893	is concerned
092894	
092895	
092896	about the things of the Lord,
092897	to
092898	be
092899	holy
092900	
092901	
092902	both in body
092903	
092904	
092905	and spirit.
092906	
092907	But
092908	a married woman
092909	is concerned
092910	
092911	
092912	about the things of the world,
092913	how
092914	to please
092915	
092916	her husband.
092917	
092918	
092919	this for
092920	
092921	
092922	
092923	your benefit,
092924	I am saying
092925	not
092926	to
092927	a limitation on you,
092928	
092929	place
092930	but
092931	so that
092932	
092933	you may give notable
092934	
092935	and constant service
092936	to
092937	the Lord.
092938	without distraction
092939	If
092940	
092941	anyone
092942	he is acting inappropriately
092943	toward
092944	
092945	his virgin,
092946	
092947	thinks
092948	if
092949	she is
092950	past the bloom of youth
092951	
092952	
092953	necessary,
092954	and it seems
092955	what
092956	he wishes;
092957	he should do
092958	he does not
092959	sin.
092960	Let them marry.
092961	the man who
092962	But
092963	is
092964	in
092965	
092966	his commitment,
092967	
092968	firm
092969	no
092970	and is under
092971	necessity
092972	control
092973	but
092974	has
092975	over
092976	
092977	his
092978	will,
092979	
092980	
092981	and has decided
092982	in
092983	
092984	his own
092985	mind
092986	to keep
092987	
092988	his own
092989	virgin,
092990	well.
092991	does
092992	So then,
092993	
092994	
092995	the one who marries
092996	
092997	his own
092998	virgin
092999	well,
093000	does
093001	
093002	
093003	not,
093004	but the one who does
093005	better.
093006	does
093007	A wife
093008	is bound
093009

093016	if
093017	But
093018	dies,
093019	
093020	her husband
093021	free
093022	she is
093023	anyone
093024	she wishes
093025	to marry
093026	(only
093027	someone in
093028	the Lord).
093029	happier
093030	But
093031	she will be
093032	if
093033	as she is –
093034	she remains
093035	
093036	
093037	in my
093038	opinion,
093039	I think
093040	and
093041	that I too
093042	the Spirit
093043	of God!
093044	have
093045	With regard to
093046	
093047	
093048	food sacrificed to idols,
093049	we know
093050	
093051	that “we all
093052	knowledge.”
093053	have
093054	
093055	Knowledge
093056	puffs up,
093057	
093058	but
093059	love
093060	builds up.
093061	If
093062	someone
093063	thinks
093064	he knows
093065	something,
093066	he does not yet
093067	know
093068	to the degree that
093069	he needs
093070	to know.
093071	if
093072	But
093073	someone
093074	loves
093075	
093076	God,
093077	
093078	he is known
093079	by God.
093080	
093081	With regard
093082	
093083	to eating
093084	then
093085	
093086	food sacrificed to idols,
093087	we know
093088	
093089	is nothing,”
093090	that “an idol

093097	
093098	but
093099	one.”
093100	
093101	
093102	If after all
093103	there are

093107	in

093114	gods
093115	many
093116	
093117	lords),
093118	and many
093119	yet for us
093120	
093121	there is one
093122	God,

093124	the Father,

093132	
093133	
093134	whom we live, and one
093135	Lord,
093136	Jesus
093137	Christ,
093138	through
093139	whom
093140	
093141	are all things
093142	
093143	we live.
093144	and through whom

093149	all.
093150	
093151	this knowledge
093152	some,
093153	And
093154	
093155	by being accustomed
093156	
093157	in former times,

093159	to idols

093430	If
093431	
093432	
093433	
093434	spiritual blessings among you,
093435	we sowed
093436	is it too much
093437	
093438	
093439	
093440	
093441	material things from you?
093442	to reap
093443	If
093444	others
093445	
093446	
093447	this right from you,
093448	receive
093449	are we not
093450	more
093451	
093452	deserving? But
093453	we have not
093454	made use
093455	
093456	of this right.
093457	
093458	Instead
093459	everything
093460	we endure
093461	so that
093462	we may not
093463	
093464	a hindrance
093465	be
093466	
093467	to the gospel
093468	
093469	of Christ.
093470	Don’t
093471	you know
093472	
093473	
093474	
093475	in the temple
093476	that those who serve
093477	
093478	from
093479	
093480	the temple,
093481	eat food
093482	
093483	
093484	at the altar
093485	and those who serve
093486	
093487	of the offerings?
093488	receive a part
093489	In the same way
093490	
093491	
093492	the Lord
093493	commanded
093494	
093495	
093496	the gospel
093497	those who proclaim
093498	by
093499	
093500	the gospel.
093501	to receive their living
093502	
093503	But
093504	I have not
093505	used
093506	any
093507	
093508	I am not
093509	writing
093510	of these rights. And
093511	
093512	these things so that
093513	
093514	something will be done
093515	for me.
093516	
093517	
093518	In fact,
093519	
093520	it would be better for me
093521	to die
093522	than –
093523	
093524	reason for boasting!
093525	
093526	no one
093527	will deprive me of my
093528	if
093529	For
093530	I preach the gospel,
093531	no
093532	I have
093533	
093534	for boasting,
093535	reason
093536	because
093537	
093538	I am compelled
093539	to do this. Woe to me
093540	
093541	
093542	
093543	if
093544	I do not
093545	preach the gospel!
093546	if
093547	For
093548	this voluntarily,
093549	
093550	I do
093551	a reward.
093552	I have
093553	if
093554	But
093555	I do it unwillingly,
093556	a responsibility.
093557	I am entrusted with
093558	What
093559	then
093560	
093561	is
093562	
093563	my reward?
093564	That
093565	when I preach the gospel
093566	free of charge,
093567	I may offer
093568	
093569	the gospel
093570	and so
093571	
093572	not
093573	make full use
093574	
093575	of my rights
093576	
093577	in
093578	
093579	the gospel.
093580	free
093581	For
093582	since I am
093583	from
093584	all
093585	to all,
093586	myself a slave
093587	I can make
093588	in order to
093589	
093590	even more people.
093591	gain
093592	
093593	I became
093594	
093595	To the Jews
093596	like
093597	a Jew
093598	to
093599	the Jews.
093600	to gain
093601	
093602	To those under
093603	the law
093604	I became like
093605	one under
093606	the law
093607	not
093608	(though I myself am
093609	
093610	under
093611	the law)
093612	
093613	
093614	those under
093615	the law.
093616	gain
093617	
093618	To those free from the law
093619	I became like
093620	one free from the law
093621	(though I am not
093622	
093623	free from
093624	God’s law
093625	but
093626	under the law
093627	of Christ)
093628	to
093629	gain
093630	those
093631	free from the law.
093632	I became
093633	
093634	To the weak
093635	weak
093636	in order to
093637	
093638	the weak.
093639	gain
093640	
093641	all things
093642	I have become
093643	to all people,
093644	so that
093645	by all means
093646	some.
093647	I may save
093648	all these things
093649	
093650	I do
093651	because of
093652	
093653	the gospel,
093654	so that
093655	a participant in it.
093656	
093657	I can be
093658	Do you not
093659	know
093660	
093661	
093662	in
093663	a stadium
093664	the runners
093665	that all
093666

093668	only one
093669	but
093670	receives
093671	
093672	the prize?
093673	So
093674	run
093675	to
093676	win.
093677	Each
093678	
093679

093681	in everything.
093682	must exercise self-control

093691	but

093709	
093710	my body
093711	
093712	and make it my slave,
093713	I myself will not

093720	I do not
093721	want
093722	For
093723	
093724	you to be unaware,
093725	brothers and sisters,
093726	
093727	
093728	that our fathers
093729	
093730	all
093731	under
093732	
093733	the cloud
093734	were
093735	
093736	and all
093737	
093738	
093739	the sea,
093740	passed through
093741	
093742	and all
093743	into
093744	
093745	Moses
093746	were baptized
093747	in
093748	
093749	the cloud
093750	
093751	and in
093752	
093753	the sea,
093754	
093755	and all
093756	
093757	
093758	the same spiritual
093759	food,
093760	ate
093761	
093762	and all
093763	
093764	
093765	the same spiritual
093766	drank
093767	drink.
093768	they were all drinking
093769	For
093770	from
093771	the spiritual
093772	that followed
093773	rock
093774	
093775	the rock
093776	them, and
093777	was
093778	
093779	Christ.
093780	But
093781	was not
093782	with
093783	
093784	most of them,
093785	
093786	pleased
093787	
093788	God
093789	they were cut down
093790	for
093791	in
093792	
093793	the wilderness.
093794	
093795	
093796	as examples for us,
093797	
093798	These things happened
093799	so that
093800	
093801	we will not
093802	
093803	
093804	crave
093805	evil things
093806	as
093807	they
093808	did.
093809	So do not
093810	idolaters,
093811	be
093812	as
093813	some of them
093814	
093815	were. As
093816	it is written,
093817	sat down
093818	
093819	“The people
093820	to eat
093821	
093822	and drink
093823	
093824	and rose up
093825	to play.”
093826	And let us not
093827	be immoral,
093828	as
093829	some of them
093830	
093831	were,
093832	
093833	died
093834	in a single
093835	day.
093836	and twenty-
093837	three
093838	thousand
093839	And let us not
093840	to the test,
093841	
093842	put Christ
093843	as
093844	some of them
093845	
093846	did,
093847	
093848	by
093849	
093850	snakes.
093851	and were destroyed
093852	And
093853	do not complain,
093854	as
093855	some of them
093856	
093857	did,
093858	
093859	and were killed
093860	by
093861	
093862	the destroying angel.
093863	
093864	
093865	as examples
093866	These things happened
093867	to them
093868	were written
093869	and
093870	for
093871	our instruction,
093872	
093873	on
093874	whom
093875	
093876	the ends
093877	
093878	of the ages
093879	have come.
093880	So
093881	
093882	let the one who thinks
093883	he is standing
093884	be careful
093885	that he does not
093886	fall.
093887	trial
093888	
093889	No
093890	has overtaken you
093891	
093892	that is not
093893	faced by others.
093894	is faithful:
093895	And
093896	
093897	God
093898	He
093899	will not
093900	let
093901	
093902	you be tried
093903	beyond
093904	what
093905	you are able
093906	to bear, but
093907	will also provide
093908	with
093909	
093910	the trial
093911	
093912	
093913	a way out
093914	
093915	so that you may be able
093916	to endure it.
093917	So then,
093918	my dear friends,
093919	
093920	flee
093921	from
093922	
093923	idolatry.
093924	
093925	to thoughtful people.
093926	I am speaking
093927	Consider
093928	
093929	what
093930	I say.
093931	
093932	the cup
093933	
093934	of blessing
093935	that
093936	we bless
093937	not
093938	a sharing
093939	Is
093940	
093941	in the blood
093942	
093943	of Christ?
093944	
093945	the bread
093946	that
093947	we break
093948	not
093949	a sharing
093950	
093951	in the body
093952	
093953	of Christ?
093954	Is
093955	
093956	Because there is one
093957	bread,
093958	one
093959	body,
093960	
093961	we who are many
093962	are
093963	
093964	for
093965	we all
093966	
093967	
093968	the one
093969	bread.
093970	share
093971	Look
093972	
093973	of Israel.
093974	
093975	at the people
093976	not
093977	
093978	those who eat
093979	
093980	the sacrifices
093981	partners
093982	
093983	in the altar?
093984	Are
093985	
093986	
093987	Am I saying
093988	
093989	food sacrificed to them
093990	to anything?
093991	amount
093992	or
093993	
093994	that idols
093995	
093996	
093997	No,
093998	
093999	I mean that what
094000	the pagans sacrifice
094001	is to demons
094002	
094003	and not
094004	to God.
094005	
094006	I do not
094007	want
094008	
094009	
094010	partners
094011	
094012	with demons.
094013	you to be
094014	
094015	You cannot
094016	the cup
094017	of the Lord
094018	drink
094019	
094020	and the cup
094021	of demons.
094022	
094023	You cannot
094024	the table
094025	of the Lord
094026	take part in
094027	
094028	and the table
094029	of demons.
094030	Or
094031	are we trying to provoke
094032	
094033	
094034	the Lord to jealousy?
094035	we really stronger than he is?
094036	
094037	Are
094038	“Everything
094039	is lawful,”
094040	but
094041	not
094042	everything
094043	is beneficial.
094044	“Everything
094045	is lawful,”
094046	but
094047	not
094048	everything
094049	builds others up.
094050	Do not
094051	
094052	your own
094053	seek
094054	good, but
094055	
094056	
094057	the good of the other person.

094538	took
094539	bread,
094540	
094541	and after he had given thanks
094542	he broke
094543	
094544	it and said,
094545	
094546	
094547	“This is
094548	
094549	my body,
094550	
094551	which is for you.

094558	remembrance
094559	In the same way,
094560	
094561	
094562	he also took the cup
094563	after
094564	
094565	supper,

094567	
094568	
094569	“This cup

094571	the new
094572	covenant
094573	is
094574	in
094575	
094576	my
094577	blood.
094578	
094579	Do this,
094580	every time
094581	
094582	you drink
094583	it, in
094584	
094585	of me.”
094586	remembrance
094587	every time

094589	
094590	you eat
094591	
094592	this bread

094602	you proclaim
094603	until
094604	
094605	he comes.
094606	For this reason,
094607	
094608	whoever
094609	eats

094611	the bread
094612	or
094613	drinks
094614	
094615	the cup
094616	
094617	of the Lord
094618	in an unworthy manner
094619	guilty
094620	will be
094621	
094622	of the body
094623	
094624	
094625	and blood
094626	
094627	of the Lord.
094628	should examine
094629	
094630	A person
094631	himself first,
094632	
094633	and in this way
094634	of
094635	
094636	the bread
094637	let him eat
094638	
094639	
094640	
094641	the cup.
094642	and drink
094643	
094644	For
094645	the one who eats
094646	
094647	and drinks
094648	judgment
094649	against himself.
094650	eats
094651	
094652	and drinks
094653	without
094654	careful regard
094655	
094656	for the body
094657	
094658	That is why
094659	
094660	
094661	many of you
094662	are weak
094663	
094664	and sick,
094665	
094666	are dead.
094667	and quite a few
094668	if
094669	But
094670	ourselves,
094671	we examined
094672	we would not
094673	
094674	be judged.
094675	when we are judged
094676	But
094677	by
094678	
094679	the Lord,
094680	we are disciplined
094681	so that
094682	we may not
094683	with
094684	
094685	the world.
094686	be condemned
094687	So then,
094688	my brothers and sisters,
094689	
094690	when you come together
094691	
094692	
094693	to eat,
094694	one another.
094695	wait for
094696	If
094697	anyone
094698	is hungry,
094699	at
094700	home,
094701	let him eat
094702	so that
094703	it does not
094704	lead to
094705	judgment.
094706	when you assemble
094707	
094708	
094709	about other matters
094710	when
094711	
094712	I come.
094713	I will give directions
094714	With regard to
094715	
094716	
094717	spiritual gifts,
094718	brothers and sisters,
094719	I do not
094720	want
094721	
094722	you to be uninformed.
094723	You know
094724	
094725	that when
094726	pagans
094727	you were
094728	by
094729	
094730	idols,
094731	
094732	speechless
094733	however
094734	
094735	you were led.
094736	you were often led astray
094737	So
094738	I want you
094739	
094740	
094741	to understand that no one
094742	by
094743	the Spirit
094744	of God
094745	speaking
094746	says,
094747	is cursed,”
094748	“Jesus
094749	
094750	and no one
094751	can
094752	say,
094753	is Lord,”
094754	“Jesus

094759	the Holy

094854	It is one

094856	
094857	
094858	and the same Spirit,
094859	distributing
094860	
094861	to each person,
094862	as
094863	he decides
094864	just as
094865	For
094866	
094867	the body

094879	of the body –

094881	are
094882	one
094883	too is
094884	body,
094885	so
094886	
094887	
094888	Christ.
094889	
094890	For
094891	in
094892	one
094893	Spirit
094894	
094895	we were all
094896	into
094897	one
094898	body.
094899	baptized
094900	Whether
094901	Jews
094902	or
094903	Greeks
094904	or
094905	slaves
094906	or
094907	free,
094908	
094909	we were all
094910	of the one
094911	Spirit.
094912	made to drink
094913	
094914	For
094915	
094916	in fact the body
094917	not
094918	is
094919	a single
094920	member,
094921	but
094922	many.
094923	If
094924	says,
094925	
094926	the foot
094927	
094928	not
094929	“Since I am
094930	a hand,
094931	not
094932	I am
094933	part of
094934	
094935	the body,”
094936	it does not
094937	because of that.
094938	
094939	
094940	
094941	lose its membership in
094942	
094943	the body
094944	
094945	And if
094946	says,
094947	
094948	the ear
094949	
094950	not
094951	“Since I am
094952	an eye,
094953	not
094954	I am
094955	part of
094956	
094957	the body,”
094958	it does not
094959	because of that.
094960	
094961	
094962	
094963	
094964	
094965	lose its membership in the body
094966	If
094967	the whole
094968	
094969	body
094970	were an eye,
094971	what
094972	
094973	part would do the hearing?
094974	If
094975	the whole
094976	were an ear,
094977	what
094978	
094979	part would exercise the sense of smell?
094980	
094981	But
094982	
094983	as a matter of fact,
094984	God has placed
094985	
094986	
094987	
094988	each
094989	of the members
094990	in
094991	
094992	the body
094993	just as
094994	he decided.
094995	If
094996	
094997	they were
094998	
094999	all
095000	the same
095001	member,
095002	where
095003	
095004	would the body be?
095005	now
095006	So
095007	there are many
095008	
095009	members,
095010	one
095011	but
095012	body.
095013	not
095014	cannot
095015	
095016	
095017	The eye
095018	say
095019	
095020	to the hand,
095021	need you,”
095022	
095023	not
095024	“I do
095025	nor
095026	in turn
095027	
095028	can the head
095029	
095030	say to the foot,
095031	need you.”
095032	
095033	
095034	“I do
095035	
095036	
095037	On the contrary,
095038	
095039	that seem
095040	those members
095041	
095042	
095043	weaker
095044	to be
095045	essential,
095046	are
095047	
095048	
095049	we consider
095050	less honorable
095051	
095052	
095053	and those members
095054	
095055	honor,
095056	with greater
095057	we clothe
095058	
095059	
095060	and our unpresentable members
095061	
095062	
095063	with dignity,
095064	are clothed
095065	
095066	but
095067	our presentable members
095068	
095069	not
095070	need
095071	do
095072	this. Instead,
095073	
095074	God
095075	has blended together
095076	
095077	the body,
095078	
095079	to the lesser member,
095080	greater
095081	giving
095082	honor
095083	so that
095084	no
095085	there may be
095086	division
095087	in
095088	
095089	the body,
095090	but
095091	
095092	
095093	for
095094	one another.
095095	may have mutual concern
095096	
095097	the members
095098	
095099	If
095100	suffers,
095101	one
095102	member
095103	suffers with
095104	everyone
095105	
095106	a member
095107	it. If
095108	is honored,
095109	
095110	
095111	rejoice with it.
095112	all
095113	
095114	
095115	
095116	Now
095117	you are
095118	body,
095119	Christ’s
095120	
095121	and each of you is a member
095122	of
095123	it.
095124	
095125	
095126	
095127	has placed
095128	
095129	And God
095130	in
095131	
095132	the church
095133	first
095134	apostles,
095135	second
095136	prophets,
095137	third
095138	teachers,
095139	then
095140	miracles,
095141	
095142	gifts
095143	of healing,
095144	helps,
095145	gifts of leadership,
095146	different kinds
095147	of tongues.
095148	Not
095149	all
095150	are apostles,
095151	are they? Not
095152	all
095153	are prophets,
095154	are they? Not
095155	all
095156	are teachers,
095157	are they? Not
095158	all
095159	perform miracles, do they?
095160	Not
095161	all
095162	gifts
095163	have
095164	of healing,
095165	do they? Not
095166	all
095167	in tongues,
095168	speak
095169	do they? Not
095170	all
095171	interpret, do they?
095172	you should be eager
095173	But
095174	
095175	gifts.
095176	
095177	for the greater
095178	
095179	And now
095180	that is beyond
095181	comparison.
095182	a way
095183	
095184	I will show you
095185	If
095186	
095187	in the tongues
095188	
095189	of men
095190	I speak
095191	
095192	
095193	and of angels,
095194	love,
095195	but
095196	I do not
095197	have
095198	I am
095199	gong
095200	a noisy
095201	or
095202	cymbal.
095203	a clanging
095204	
095205	And if
095206	I have
095207	prophecy,
095208	
095209	and know
095210	
095211	mysteries
095212	all
095213	
095214	and all
095215	
095216	knowledge,
095217	
095218	and if
095219	I have
095220	all
095221	
095222	faith
095223	so that
095224	mountains,
095225	I can remove
095226	love,
095227	but
095228	do not
095229	have
095230	nothing.
095231	I am
095232	If
095233	I give away
095234	everything
095235	
095236	I own,
095237	
095238	
095239	and if
095240	I give over
095241	
095242	my body
095243	
095244	in order to
095245	boast,
095246	love,
095247	but
095248	do not
095249	have
095250	I receive no
095251	benefit.
095252	
095253	Love
095254	is patient,
095255	is kind,
095256	
095257	love
095258	it is not
095259	envious.
095260	
095261	Love
095262	does not
095263	brag,
095264	it is not
095265	puffed up.
095266	It is not
095267	rude,
095268	it is not
095269	
095270	
095271	self-serving,
095272	it is not
095273	easily angered
095274	
095275	
095276	
095277	or resentful.
095278	It is not
095279	glad
095280	about
095281	
095282	injustice,
095283	rejoices
095284	but
095285	
095286	in the truth.
095287	all things,
095288	It bears
095289	all things,
095290	believes
095291	all things,
095292	hopes
095293	all things.
095294	endures
095295	
095296	Love
095297	never
095298	ends.
095299	if
095300	But
095301	there are prophecies,
095302	they will be set aside;
095303	if
095304	there are tongues,
095305	they will cease;
095306	if
095307	there is knowledge,
095308	it will be set aside.
095309	in
095310	part,
095311	For
095312	we know
095313	
095314	in
095315	part,
095316	and we prophesy
095317	when
095318	but
095319	comes,
095320	
095321	what is perfect
095322	
095323	
095324	the partial
095325	will be set aside.
095326	When
095327	I was
095328	a child,
095329	I talked
095330	like
095331	a child,
095332	I thought
095333	like
095334	a child,
095335	I reasoned
095336	like
095337	a child.
095338	But when
095339	I became
095340	an adult,
095341	I set aside
095342	
095343	
095344	childish ways.
095345	we see
095346	For
095347	now
095348	
095349	a mirror
095350	in
095351	indirectly,
095352	then
095353	but
095354	we will see face
095355	to
095356	face.
095357	Now
095358	I know
095359	in
095360	part,
095361	then
095362	but
095363	I will know fully,
095364	just as
095365	
095366	I have been fully known.
095367	now
095368	And
095369	remain:
095370	faith,
095371	hope,
095372	and love.
095373	
095374	these three
095375	
095376	the greatest
095377	But
095378	
095379	
095380	of these is love.
095381	Pursue
095382	
095383	love
095384	be eager
095385	and
095386	
095387	for the spiritual gifts,
095388	especially
095389	
095390	that
095391	you may prophesy.
095392	
095393	For
095394	the one speaking
095395	in a tongue
095396	does not
095397	to people
095398	speak
095399	but
095400	to God,
095401	no one
095402	for
095403	understands;
095404	by the Spirit.
095405	
095406	he is speaking
095407	mysteries
095408	
095409	But
095410	the one who prophesies
095411	to people
095412	speaks
095413	for their strengthening,
095414	
095415	encouragement,
095416	
095417	and consolation.
095418	
095419	The one who speaks
095420	in a tongue
095421	himself up,
095422	builds
095423	
095424	but
095425	the one who prophesies
095426	the church.
095427	builds up
095428	I wish you
095429	
095430	all
095431	
095432	spoke
095433	in tongues,
095434	even more
095435	but
095436	that
095437	you would prophesy.
095438	is greater
095439	
095440	
095441	The one who prophesies
095442	
095443	
095444	than the one who speaks
095445	in tongues,
095446	
095447	
095448	unless
095449	he interprets
095450	so that
095451	
095452	the church
095453	strengthened.
095454	may be
095455	Now,
095456	
095457	brothers and sisters,
095458	if
095459	I come
095460	to
095461	
095462	in tongues,
095463	you speaking
095464	how
095465	
095466	will I help you
095467	
095468	unless
095469	
095470	I speak to you
095471	
095472	with
095473	a revelation
095474	or
095475	with
095476	knowledge
095477	or
095478	
095479	prophecy
095480	or
095481	
095482	teaching?
095483	It is similar
095484	
095485	for lifeless
095486	a sound,
095487	things that make
095488	
095489	like a flute
095490	or
095491	harp.
095492	Unless
095493	a distinction
095494	
095495	
095496	in the notes,
095497	they make
095498	how
095499	be understood?
095500	
095501	can what is played on the flute
095502	or
095503	
095504	harp
095505	
095506	for example,
095507	If,
095508	an unclear
095509	the trumpet
095510	sound,
095511	makes
095512	who
095513	will get ready
095514	for
095515	battle?
095516	It
095517	is the same
095518	for you.
095519	with
095520	
095521	your tongue,
095522	If
095523	you do not
095524	clearly
095525	speak
095526	
095527	how
095528	will anyone know
095529	
095530	what is being said?
095531	you will be
095532	For
095533	into
095534	the air.
095535	speaking
095536	many
095537	
095538	probably
095539	kinds
095540	of languages
095541	There are
095542	in
095543	the world,
095544	
095545	and none
095546	is without meaning.
095547	If
095548	then
095549	I do not
095550	know
095551	
095552	the meaning
095553	
095554	of a language,
095555	I will be
095556	
095557	to the speaker
095558	a foreigner
095559	
095560	
095561	and the speaker
095562	to me.
095563	
095564	a foreigner
095565	It is the same with you.
095566	
095567	
095568	Since
095569	eager
095570	you are
095571	for manifestations of the Spirit,
095572	in order to
095573	
095574	strengthen
095575	
095576	the church.
095577	seek
095578	to
095579	abound
095580	So then,
095581	
095582	one who speaks
095583	in a tongue
095584	should pray
095585	that
095586	he may interpret.
095587	If
095588	
095589	I pray
095590	in a tongue,
095591	
095592	my spirit
095593	
095594	prays,
095595	
095596	but
095597	my mind
095598	
095599	unproductive.
095600	is
095601	What
095602	
095603	
095604	should I do? I will pray
095605	
095606	with my spirit,
095607	I will also pray
095608	but
095609	
095610	
095611	with my mind.
095612	I will sing praises
095613	
095614	with my spirit,
095615	I will also sing praises
095616	but
095617	
095618	
095619	with my mind.
095620	Otherwise,
095621	if
095622	you are praising God
095623	with
095624	your spirit,
095625	
095626	
095627	
095628	
095629	
095630	can someone without the gift
095631	how
095632	
095633	
095634	“Amen”
095635	to
095636	
095637	your
095638	thanksgiving,
095639	since
095640	what you are saying?
095641	say
095642	he does not
095643	know
095644	
095645	are certainly
095646	For you
095647	well,
095648	giving thanks
095649	but
095650	
095651	the other person
095652	is not
095653	strengthened.
095654	I thank
095655	
095656	God
095657	than all of you,
095658	
095659	more
095660	in tongues
095661	that I speak
095662	but
095663	in
095664	the church
095665	I want
095666	five
095667	words
095668	
095669	with my mind
095670	
095671	to speak
095672	
095673	
095674	others,
095675	to instruct
095676	rather than
095677	ten thousand
095678	words
095679	in
095680	a tongue.
095681	Brothers and sisters,
095682	do not
095683	children
095684	be
095685	
095686	in your thinking.
095687	Instead,
095688	
095689	in evil,
095690	infants
095691	
095692	but
095693	in your thinking
095694	be mature.
095695	be
095696	in
095697	
095698	the law:
095699	It is written
095700	
095701	“By people with
095702	strange tongues
095703	
095704	and by
095705	the lips
095706	of strangers
095707	I will speak
095708	
095709	to this people,
095710	
095711	
095712	yet not even
095713	in this way
095714	will they listen to me,”
095715	
095716	says
095717	the Lord.
095718	So then,
095719	
095720	tongues
095721	
095722	a sign
095723	are
095724	not
095725	
095726	for believers
095727	but
095728	
095729	for unbelievers.
095730	
095731	however,
095732	Prophecy,
095733	is not
095734	
095735	for unbelievers
095736	but
095737	
095738	for believers.
095739	if
095740	So
095741	comes together
095742	
095743	church
095744	the whole
095745	
095746	
095747	
095748	
095749	and all
095750	speak
095751	in tongues,
095752	people enter,
095753	and
095754	uninformed
095755	or
095756	unbelievers
095757	will they not
095758	say
095759	
095760	that you have lost your minds?
095761	if
095762	But
095763	all
095764	prophesy,
095765	enters,
095766	and
095767	
095768	an unbeliever
095769	or
095770	uninformed person
095771	he will be convicted
095772	by
095773	all,
095774	he will be called to account
095775	by
095776	all.
095777	
095778	The secrets
095779	
095780	of his heart
095781	
095782	disclosed,
095783	are
095784	
095785	and in this way
095786	he will fall down
095787	with
095788	his face
095789	to the ground and worship
095790	
095791	God,
095792	declaring,
095793	
095794	really
095795	
095796	“God
095797	among you.”
095798	
095799	is
095800	What
095801	should you do then,
095802	
095803	brothers and sisters?
095804	When
095805	you come together,
095806	each one
095807	a song,
095808	has
095809	a lesson,
095810	has
095811	a revelation,
095812	has
095813	a tongue,
095814	has
095815	an interpretation.
095816	has
095817	Let all these things
095818	for
095819	the strengthening of the church.
095820	be done
095821	If
095822	a tongue,
095823	someone
095824	speaks
095825	in
095826	it should be two,
095827	or
095828	
095829	at the most
095830	three,
095831	
095832	
095833	one after the other,
095834	
095835	and someone
095836	must interpret.
095837	if
095838	But
095839	no
095840	there is
095841	interpreter,
095842	he should be silent
095843	in
095844	the church.
095845	to himself
095846	
095847	Let him speak
095848	
095849	
095850	and to God.
095851	prophets
095852	
095853	Two
095854	or
095855	three
095856	should speak
095857	
095858	
095859	and the others
095860	should evaluate what is said.
095861	if
095862	And
095863	someone
095864	receives a revelation,
095865	sitting down
095866	
095867	the person who is speaking
095868	should conclude.
095869	you can
095870	For
095871	
095872	one after another,
095873	all
095874	prophesy
095875	so
095876	all
095877	can learn
095878	
095879	
095880	and be encouraged.
095881	
095882	Indeed, the spirits
095883	of the prophets
095884	to the prophets,
095885	are subject
095886	not
095887	for
095888	is
095889	characterized by disorder
095890	
095891	God
095892	but
095893	by peace.
095894	As
095895	in
095896	all
095897	
095898	the churches
095899	
095900	of the saints,
095901	
095902	the women
095903	in
095904	
095905	the churches,
095906	should be silent
095907	they are not
095908	for
095909	permitted
095910	
095911	to speak.
095912	Rather,
095913	let them be in submission,
095914	as
095915	
095916	
095917	in fact the law
095918	says.
095919	If
095920	
095921	about something,
095922	to find out
095923	they want
095924	at
095925	home,
095926	
095927	their
095928	husbands
095929	they should ask
095930	disgraceful
095931	because
095932	it is
095933	for a woman
095934	to speak
095935	in
095936	church.
095937	
095938	with you,
095939	
095940	
095941	Did the word
095942	
095943	of God
095944	begin
095945	or
095946	to you
095947	
095948	alone?
095949	did it come
095950	If
095951	anyone
095952	considers
095953	himself a prophet
095954	to you is
095955	or
095956	spiritual person,
095957	he should acknowledge
095958	that what
095959	I write
095960	
095961	
095962	the Lord’s
095963	
095964	command.
095965	If
095966	
095967	someone
095968	does not recognize
095969	this, he is not recognized.
095970	So then,
095971	brothers and sisters,
095972	
095973	be eager
095974	
095975	to prophesy,
095976	
095977	
095978	anyone from speaking
095979	and do not
095980	forbid
095981	in tongues.
095982	everything
095983	And
095984	in a decent
095985	
095986	
095987	and orderly manner.
095988	do
095989	I want to make clear for you,
095990	Now
095991	
095992	brothers and sisters,
095993	
095994	the gospel
095995	that
095996	I preached to you,
095997	
095998	that
095999	
096000	you received
096001	and on
096002	which
096003	
096004	you stand,
096005	and by
096006	which
096007	
096008	you are being saved,
096009	
096010	to the message
096011	I preached to you –
096012	
096013	if
096014	you hold firmly
096015	
096016	
096017	unless
096018	in vain.
096019	you believed
096020	I passed on to you
096021	For
096022	
096023	
096024	as of first importance
096025	what
096026	
096027	I also received –
096028	
096029	that Christ
096030	died
096031	for
096032	
096033	our sins
096034	
096035	according to
096036	
096037	the scriptures,
096038	
096039	
096040	and that he was buried,
096041	
096042	
096043	and that he was raised
096044	
096045	day
096046	
096047	on the third
096048	according to
096049	
096050	the scriptures,
096051	
096052	
096053	and that he appeared
096054	to Cephas,
096055	then
096056	
096057	to the twelve.
096058	Then
096059	he appeared
096060	to more than
096061	five hundred
096062	of the brothers and sisters
096063	at one time,
096064	of
096065	whom
096066	
096067	most
096068	alive,
096069	are still
096070	
096071	some
096072	though
096073	have fallen asleep.
096074	Then
096075	he appeared
096076	to James,
096077	then
096078	
096079	the apostles.
096080	to all
096081	Last
096082	
096083	of all,
096084	as though
096085	
096086	to one born at the wrong time,
096087	he appeared
096088	to me also.
096089	
096090	For
096091	I am
096092	
096093	the least
096094	
096095	of the apostles,
096096	
096097	
096098	
096099	unworthy
096100	to be called
096101	an apostle,
096102	because
096103	I persecuted
096104	
096105	the church
096106	
096107	of God.
096108	by the grace
096109	But
096110	of God
096111	I am
096112	what
096113	I am,
096114	
096115	
096116	and his grace
096117	
096118	
096119	to me
096120	
096121	has not
096122	in vain.
096123	been
096124	In fact,
096125	harder
096126	
096127	than all of them –
096128	I worked
096129	not
096130	
096131	yet
096132	I, but
096133	
096134	the grace
096135	
096136	of God
096137	
096138	with me.
096139	
096140	Whether
096141	then
096142	
096143	it was I or
096144	they,
096145	this is the way
096146	we preach
096147	
096148	and this is the way
096149	you believed.
096150	if
096151	Now
096152	Christ
096153	is being preached
096154	
096155	from
096156	the dead,
096157	as raised
096158	how
096159	you say
096160	of
096161	
096162	can some
096163	
096164	resurrection
096165	of the dead?
096166	no
096167	there is
096168	if
096169	But
096170	resurrection
096171	of the dead,
096172	no
096173	there is
096174	then not even
096175	Christ
096176	has been raised.
096177	if
096178	And
096179	Christ
096180	has not
096181	been raised,
096182	is futile
096183	then
096184	
096185	
096186	our preaching
096187	
096188	is empty.
096189	
096190	
096191	and your faith
096192	
096193	we are found
096194	Also,
096195	
096196	to be false witnesses
096197	
096198	about God,
096199	
096200	because we have testified
096201	against
096202	
096203	God
096204	
096205	that he raised
096206	
096207	Christ from the dead,
096208	him,
096209	when in reality he did not
096210	raise
096211	if indeed
096212	
096213	the dead
096214	are not
096215	raised.
096216	if
096217	For
096218	the dead
096219	are not
096220	raised,
096221	then not even
096222	Christ
096223	has been raised.
096224	if
096225	And
096226	Christ
096227	has not
096228	been raised,
096229	is useless;
096230	
096231	your faith
096232	
096233	still
096234	you are
096235	in
096236	
096237	your sins.
096238	
096239	Furthermore,
096240	
096241	
096242	those who have fallen asleep
096243	in
096244	Christ
096245	have also perished.
096246	For if
096247	only in
096248	
096249	this life
096250	
096251	in
096252	Christ,
096253	we have hope
096254	we should be
096255	
096256	pitied more
096257	
096258	than anyone.
096259	
096260	now
096261	But
096262	Christ
096263	has been raised
096264	from
096265	the dead,
096266	the firstfruits
096267	
096268	of those who have fallen asleep.
096269	since
096270	For
096271	came through
096272	a man,
096273	death
096274	
096275	also came through
096276	a man.
096277	the resurrection
096278	of the dead
096279	just as
096280	For
096281	in
096282	
096283	Adam
096284	all
096285	die,
096286	so
096287	
096288	also in
096289	
096290	Christ
096291	all
096292	will be made alive.
096293	each
096294	But
096295	in
096296	
096297	his own
096298	order:
096299	the firstfruits;
096300	Christ,
096301	then
096302	
096303	
096304	when Christ
096305	
096306	
096307	comes, those who belong to him.
096308	
096309	Then
096310	
096311	
096312	when
096313	he hands over
096314	
096315	the kingdom
096316	
096317	to God
096318	
096319	the Father,
096320	when
096321	comes the end,
096322	he has brought to an end all
096323	rule
096324	
096325	and all
096326	authority
096327	
096328	and power.
096329	he must
096330	For
096331	
096332	reign
096333	until
096334	
096335	he has put
096336	all
096337	
096338	his enemies
096339	under
096340	
096341	his feet.
096342	
096343	The last
096344	enemy
096345	to be eliminated
096346	
096347	is death.
096348	he has put everything
096349	For
096350	in subjection
096351	under
096352	
096353	his feet.
096354	
096355	when
096356	But
096357	it says
096358	
096359	“everything”
096360	has been put in subjection,
096361	it is clear
096362	
096363	that this does not include
096364	the one who put
096365	in subjection to him.
096366	
096367	
096368	everything
096369	when
096370	And
096371	all things are subjected to him,
096372	
096373	
096374	everything to him,
096375	then
096376	
096377	
096378	
096379	the Son himself
096380	will be subjected
096381	
096382	to the one who subjected
096383	
096384	
096385	
096386	so that
096387	
096388	
096389	God
096390	
096391	may be all
096392	in
096393	all.
096394	Otherwise,
096395	what
096396	will those do
096397	
096398	who are baptized
096399	for
096400	
096401	the dead?
096402	If
096403	at all,
096404	the dead
096405	are not
096406	raised
096407	then why
096408	
096409	are they baptized
096410	for them?
096411	
096412	Why
096413	
096414	
096415	too are
096416	we in danger every
096417	hour?
096418	Every
096419	day
096420	I am in danger of death!
096421	This is as sure
096422	
096423	in you,
096424	as my boasting
096425	
096426	which
096427	I have
096428	in
096429	Christ
096430	Jesus
096431	
096432	our Lord.
096433	
096434	If
096435	from
096436	a human point of view
096437	I fought with wild beasts
096438	at
096439	Ephesus,
096440	what
096441	
096442	
096443	did it benefit me?
096444	If
096445	the dead
096446	are not
096447	raised,
096448	let us eat
096449	
096450	and drink,
096451	tomorrow
096452	for
096453	we die.
096454	Do not
096455	be deceived:
096456	corrupts
096457	morals.”
096458	good
096459	company
096460	“Bad
096461	Sober up
096462	as you should,
096463	
096464	and stop
096465	sinning!
096466	no knowledge
096467	For
096468	of God –
096469	some
096470	have
096471	this to
096472	your shame!
096473	
096474	I say
096475	But
096476	will say,
096477	someone
096478	“How
096479	raised?
096480	
096481	are the dead
096482	With what kind
096483	
096484	of body
096485	will they come?”
096486	Fool!
096487	
096488	What
096489	you sow
096490	will not
096491	come to life
096492	
096493	unless
096494	it dies.
096495	
096496	And what
096497	you sow
096498	is not
096499	
096500	the body
096501	
096502	that is to be,
096503	
096504	but
096505	a bare
096506	seed –
096507	
096508	perhaps
096509	of wheat
096510	or
096511	something
096512	
096513	else.
096514	
096515	But
096516	God
096517	gives it
096518	
096519	a body
096520	just as
096521	he planned,
096522	
096523	and to each
096524	
096525	of the seeds
096526	of its own.
096527	a body
096528	is not the same:
096529	All
096530	flesh
096531	
096532	
096533	
096534	
096535	have one flesh,
096536	
096537	People
096538	have another,
096539	
096540	
096541	animals
096542	another.
096543	
096544	
096545	birds
096546	
096547	and
096548	fish
096549	
096550	bodies
096551	And there are heavenly
096552	
096553	bodies.
096554	and earthly
096555	
096556	body is one sort
096557	
096558	
096559	
096560	of the heavenly
096561	The glory
096562	another.
096563	and
096564	
096565	
096566	the earthly
096567	There is one
096568	glory
096569	of the sun,
096570	
096571	and another
096572	glory
096573	of the moon
096574	
096575	and another
096576	glory
096577	of the stars,
096578	star
096579	for
096580	from star
096581	differs
096582	in
096583	glory.
096584	It is the same with
096585	
096586	
096587	the resurrection
096588	
096589	of the dead.
096590	What is sown
096591	
096592	is perishable,
096593	what is raised
096594	
096595	is imperishable.
096596	It is sown
096597	in
096598	dishonor,
096599	it is raised
096600	in
096601	glory;
096602	it is sown
096603	in
096604	weakness,
096605	it is raised
096606	in
096607	power;
096608	it is sown
096609	body,
096610	a natural
096611	it is raised
096612	body.
096613	a spiritual
096614	If
096615	there is
096616	
096617	a natural
096618	there is also a spiritual body.
096619	
096620	body,
096621	So
096622	
096623	also it is written,
096624	became
096625	
096626	“The first
096627	man,
096628	Adam,
096629	
096630	person”;
096631	a living
096632	
096633	the last
096634	Adam
096635	
096636	spirit.
096637	became a life-giving
096638	However,
096639	did not
096640	come first,
096641	
096642	the spiritual
096643	but
096644	
096645	the natural,
096646	and then
096647	
096648	the spiritual.
096649	
096650	The first
096651	man
096652	is from
096653	the earth,
096654	made of dust;
096655	
096656	the second
096657	man
096658	is from
096659	heaven.
096660	Like
096661	
096662	the one made of dust,
096663	so
096664	
096665	
096666	too are those made of dust,
096667	
096668	and like
096669	
096670	the one from heaven,
096671	so
096672	
096673	
096674	too those who are heavenly.
096675	
096676	And just as
096677	we have borne
096678	
096679	the image
096680	
096681	of the man of dust,
096682	let us also bear
096683	
096684	
096685	the image
096686	
096687	of the man of heaven.
096688	
096689	Now
096690	this is what I am saying,
096691	brothers and sisters:
096692	
096693	Flesh
096694	
096695	and blood
096696	the kingdom
096697	of God,
096698	inherit
096699	
096700	cannot
096701	nor
096702	
096703	does the perishable
096704	
096705	the imperishable.
096706	inherit
096707	Listen,
096708	a mystery:
096709	
096710	I will tell you
096711	all
096712	We will not
096713	sleep,
096714	we will all
096715	but
096716	be changed –
096717	in
096718	a moment,
096719	in
096720	the blinking
096721	of an eye,
096722	at
096723	
096724	the last
096725	trumpet.
096726	the trumpet will sound,
096727	For
096728	
096729	
096730	and the dead
096731	will be raised
096732	imperishable,
096733	
096734	
096735	and we will be changed.
096736	
096737	For
096738	
096739	this perishable body
096740	
096741	must put on
096742	the imperishable,
096743	
096744	
096745	and this mortal body
096746	
096747	must put on
096748	immortality.
096749	when
096750	Now
096751	
096752	this perishable
096753	
096754	puts on
096755	the imperishable,
096756	
096757	
096758	and this mortal
096759	
096760	puts on
096761	immortality,
096762	then
096763	
096764	
096765	the saying
096766	
096767	that is written
096768	has been swallowed up
096769	
096770	will happen, “Death
096771	in
096772	victory.”
096773	“Where,
096774	
096775	O death,
096776	
096777	is your victory?
096778	Where,
096779	
096780	O death,
096781	
096782	is your sting?”
096783	
096784	
096785	The sting
096786	
096787	of death
096788	
096789	is sin,
096790	
096791	and
096792	the power
096793	
096794	of sin
096795	
096796	is the law.
096797	
096798	But
096799	be to God,
096800	thanks
096801	
096802	who gives us
096803	
096804	
096805	the victory
096806	through
096807	
096808	our Lord
096809	
096810	Jesus
096811	Christ!
096812	So then,
096813	brothers and sisters,
096814	
096815	dear
096816	firm.
096817	be
096818	Do not be moved!
096819	be outstanding
096820	in
096821	
096822	the work
096823	
096824	of the Lord,
096825	Always
096826	knowing
096827	
096828	
096829	that your labor
096830	
096831	not
096832	is
096833	in vain
096834	in
096835	the Lord.
096836	With regard to
096837	
096838	
096839	the collection
096840	
096841	for
096842	
096843	the saints,
096844	that
096845	the directions
096846	
096847	I gave to the churches
096848	
096849	of Galatia:
096850	
096851	
096852	
096853	please follow
096854	On
096855	the first
096856	day of the week,
096857	each
096858	
096859	
096860	
096861	of you should set aside
096862	some income and save
096863	
096864	
096865	
096866	God has blessed
096867	it to the extent that
096868	will not
096869	when
096870	I come.
096871	
096872	you, so that a collection
096873	have to be made
096874	when
096875	Then,
096876	I arrive,
096877	
096878	
096879	those whom you approve
096880	with
096881	letters
096882	
096883	I will send
096884	of explanation to carry
096885	
096886	your gift
096887	
096888	to
096889	Jerusalem.
096890	if
096891	And
096892	advisable
096893	it seems
096894	
096895	that I
096896	should go
096897	with me.
096898	
096899	also, they will go
096900	I will come
096901	But
096902	to you
096903	
096904	after
096905	Macedonia –
096906	I have gone through
096907	Macedonia –
096908	for
096909	I will be going through
096910	with you,
096911	
096912	and
096913	perhaps
096914	I will stay
096915	or
096916	
096917	even spend the winter,
096918	so that
096919	you can send me
096920	
096921	on my journey,
096922	wherever
096923	
096924	I go.
096925	I do not
096926	want
096927	For
096928	
096929	now
096930	in
096931	passing,
096932	to see you
096933	I hope
096934	since
096935	time
096936	some
096937	to spend
096938	with you,
096939	
096940	if
096941	
096942	the Lord
096943	allows.
096944	I will stay
096945	But
096946	in
096947	Ephesus
096948	until
096949	
096950	Pentecost,
096951	a door
096952	because
096953	
096954	stands wide open for me,
096955	of great
096956	
096957	opportunity
096958	
096959	opponents.
096960	but there are many
096961	if
096962	Now
096963	comes,
096964	Timothy
096965	see
096966	that
096967	nothing to fear
096968	he has
096969	among you,
096970	
096971	
096972	for
096973	he is doing
096974	the Lord’s
096975	work,
096976	as
096977	I am too.
096978	let no
096979	one
096980	So then,
096981	him with contempt.
096982	treat
096983	send
096984	But
096985	him on his way
096986	in
096987	peace
096988	so that
096989	he may come
096990	to me.
096991	
096992	I am expecting him
096993	For
096994	
096995	with
096996	
096997	the brothers.
096998	With regard to

097000	Apollos:
097001	
097002	our brother

097008	
097009	
097010	with
097011	
097012	the other brothers,
097013	
097014	simply
097015	not

097017	his intention
097018	to
097019	now.
097020	come
097021	He will come
097022	
097023	when
097024	he has the opportunity.
097025	Stay alert,
097026	stand firm

097029	the faith,
097030	show courage,

097247	
097248	the sufferings
097249	
097250	of Christ
097251	toward us,
097252	
097253	so
097254	through

097256	Christ
097257	overflows to you.
097258	
097259	
097260	also our comfort

097270	and salvation;
097271	if

097275	
097276	your comfort
097277	
097278	that you experience
097279	in
097280	your patient endurance
097281	
097282	
097283	of the same sufferings
097284	that
097285	
097286	
097287	we also suffer.
097288	
097289	
097290	And our hope
097291	
097292	is steadfast
097293	for you
097294	
097295	because we know
097296	
097297	that as
097298	you share
097299	
097300	
097301	in our sufferings,
097302	so
097303	
097304	
097305	also you will share in our comfort.
097306	we do not
097307	For
097308	want
097309	
097310	you to be unaware,
097311	brothers
097312	and sisters, regarding
097313	
097314	the affliction
097315	
097316	
097317	that happened to us
097318	in
097319	
097320	the province of Asia,
097321	
097322	
097323	excessively,
097324	beyond
097325	our strength,
097326	that we were burdened
097327	so that
097328	we despaired
097329	
097330	
097331	
097332	even of living.
097333	Indeed
097334	
097335	had been passed against
097336	us,
097337	
097338	as if the sentence
097339	
097340	of death
097341	we felt
097342	so that
097343	we would not
097344	trust
097345	
097346	in
097347	ourselves
097348	but
097349	in
097350	
097351	God
097352	
097353	who raises
097354	
097355	the dead.
097356	him
097357	from
097358	so great a risk
097359	of death,
097360	He delivered us
097361	
097362	
097363	and he will deliver
097364	our hope on
097365	
097366	us. We have set
097367	
097368	
097369	us yet again,
097370	that he will deliver
097371	as you also join in helping us
097372	
097373	
097374	to God on
097375	
097376	
097377	by prayer,
097378	so that
097379	
097380	many
097381	people
097382	
097383	given to us
097384	
097385	the gracious gift
097386	through
097387	the help of many.
097388	may give thanks
097389	our behalf for
097390	
097391	
097392	For
097393	our reason for confidence
097394	
097395	
097396	is this:
097397	
097398	the testimony
097399	
097400	of our conscience,
097401	
097402	
097403	that with
097404	pure motives
097405	
097406	and sincerity
097407	
097408	which are from God –
097409	
097410	not
097411	by
097412	wisdom
097413	human
097414	but
097415	by
097416	the grace
097417	of God –
097418	we conducted
097419	ourselves in
097420	
097421	the world,
097422	all the more
097423	and
097424	toward you.
097425	
097426	we do not
097427	For
097428	anything
097429	write you
097430	
097431	other
097432	than
097433	what
097434	you can read
097435	and
097436	
097437	also understand.
097438	I hope
097439	But
097440	
097441	
097442	completely
097443	that you will understand
097444	just as
097445	
097446	understood us,
097447	
097448	
097449	also you have partly
097450	
097451	your source of pride
097452	
097453	that we are
097454	just as you
097455	
097456	
097457	
097458	also are ours in
097459	
097460	the day
097461	
097462	of the Lord
097463	
097464	Jesus.
097465	
097466	
097467	
097468	And with this confidence
097469	I intended
097470	first
097471	to you
097472	
097473	to come
097474	so that
097475	a second
097476	opportunity to see us,
097477	you would get
097478	
097479	and through
097480	
097481	your help to go on
097482	into
097483	Macedonia
097484	
097485	and then
097486	from
097487	Macedonia
097488	to come back
097489	to
097490	
097491	
097492	by you.
097493	
097494	you and be helped on
097495	our way into
097496	
097497	Judea
097498	
097499	Therefore
097500	when I was planning to do this,
097501	did not do so without thinking
097502	
097503	
097504	I
097505	about what I was doing,
097506	did I? Or
097507	
097508	do I make
097509	according to
097510	mere human standards
097511	my plans
097512	so that
097513	I would be
097514	
097515	
097516	
097517	saying both “Yes,
097518	yes”
097519	
097520	
097521	and “No,
097522	no” at the same time?
097523	is faithful,
097524	But
097525	
097526	as God
097527	
097528	
097529	our message
097530	
097531	
097532	to
097533	
097534	not
097535	you is
097536	“Yes”
097537	
097538	and “No.”
097539	
097540	
097541	of God,
097542	For
097543	the Son
097544	Jesus
097545	Christ,
097546	
097547	among you
097548	
097549	by us –
097550	
097551	the one who was proclaimed
097552	by me
097553	
097554	
097555	and Silvanus
097556	
097557	and Timothy –
097558	not
097559	was
097560	“Yes”
097561	
097562	and “No,”
097563	but
097564	“Yes”
097565	in him.
097566	
097567	it has always been
097568	every one
097569	For
097570	promises
097571	of God’s
097572	in him;
097573	
097574	
097575	are “Yes”
097576	therefore
097577	
097578	also through him
097579	
097580	
097581	the “Amen”
097582	
097583	we give to God.
097584	is spoken, to
097585	the glory
097586	
097587	
097588	
097589	But
097590	who establishes us
097591	
097592	together with you
097593	
097594	in
097595	Christ
097596	
097597	and who anointed us,
097598	
097599	it is God
097600	
097601	
097602	who also sealed us
097603	
097604	
097605	and gave us
097606	
097607	as a down payment.
097608	
097609	the Spirit
097610	in
097611	
097612	our hearts
097613	
097614	
097615	Now
097616	my witness,
097617	
097618	to God
097619	I appeal
097620	as
097621	
097622	
097623	
097624	
097625	that to spare you
097626	
097627	I did not
097628	come
097629	again to
097630	Corinth.
097631	I do not
097632	
097633	mean that we rule over
097634	
097635	
097636	your faith,
097637	but
097638	workers with
097639	we are
097640	
097641	you for your joy,
097642	
097643	
097644	because
097645	by faith
097646	you stand firm.
097647	I made up
097648	So
097649	my own mind
097650	
097651	
097652	not
097653	another
097654	
097655	painful
097656	
097657	to pay you
097658	visit.
097659	if
097660	For
097661	
097662	I make you sad,
097663	
097664	
097665	who
097666	
097667	would be left to make me glad
097668	
097669	
097670	but
097671	
097672	the one I caused to be sad?
097673	
097674	
097675	
097676	And I wrote
097677	
097678	
097679	this very thing to you, so that
097680	I would not
097681	when I came
097682	sadness
097683	have
097684	from
097685	those who
097686	ought to make me
097687	
097688	rejoice,
097689	since I am confident
097690	in you
097691	all
097692	
097693	
097694	
097695	that my
097696	joy
097697	
097698	
097699	would be yours.
097700	out of
097701	For
097702	great
097703	distress
097704	
097705	and anguish
097706	of heart
097707	I wrote to you
097708	
097709	with
097710	many
097711	tears,
097712	not
097713	to
097714	make you sad,
097715	but
097716	
097717	the love
097718	
097719	to let you know
097720	that
097721	I have
097722	especially
097723	for you.
097724	
097725	if
097726	But
097727	anyone
097728	has caused sadness,
097729	he has not
097730	
097731	saddened me
097732	alone, but
097733	to
097734	some extent
097735	
097736	(not
097737	to exaggerate)
097738	he has saddened all of you as well.
097739	
097740	is enough for him,
097741	
097742	on such an individual
097743	
097744	This punishment
097745	
097746	
097747	by
097748	
097749	the majority
097750	so that
097751	now instead you
097752	should rather
097753	
097754	forgive
097755	
097756	
097757	and comfort
097758	
097759	
097760	by excessive
097761	grief to the point of despair.
097762	will keep him from being overwhelmed
097763	
097764	him. This
097765	Therefore
097766	I urge
097767	
097768	you to reaffirm
097769	for him.
097770	
097771	your love
097772	For
097773	
097774	
097775	
097776	this reason also I wrote
097777	you: to
097778	you to see
097779	
097780	test
097781	
097782	if
097783	in
097784	everything.
097785	obedient
097786	you are
097787	anyone
097788	
097789	for anything,
097790	If you forgive
097791	I also
097792	
097793	
097794	
097795	indeed what
097796	I have forgiven
097797	(if
097798	anything)
097799	I have forgiven
097800	forgive him – for
097801	you
097802	I did so for
097803	in the presence
097804	of Christ,
097805	
097806	so that
097807	we may not be exploited
097808	by
097809	
097810	Satan
097811	we are not
097812	(for
097813	
097814	
097815	of his schemes).
097816	ignorant
097817	when I arrived
097818	Now
097819	in
097820	
097821	Troas
097822	to
097823	
097824	proclaim the gospel
097825	
097826	of Christ,
097827	
097828	a door of opportunity for me,
097829	
097830	had opened
097831	
097832	even though the Lord
097833	no
097834	I had
097835	relief
097836	
097837	in my spirit, because I
097838	
097839	
097840	did not
097841	find
097842	
097843	Titus
097844	
097845	my brother
097846	
097847	there. So
097848	I said goodbye to them
097849	
097850	and set out
097851	for
097852	Macedonia.
097853	
097854	But
097855	be to God
097856	thanks
097857	
097858	who always
097859	leads us
097860	
097861	in triumphal procession in
097862	
097863	Christ
097864	
097865	
097866	the fragrance
097867	
097868	that consists of the knowledge of him
097869	
097870	and who makes known
097871	through us
097872	
097873	in
097874	every
097875	place.
097876	
097877	of Christ
097878	a sweet aroma
097879	For we are
097880	
097881	to God
097882	among
097883	
097884	those who are being saved
097885	
097886	and among
097887	
097888	those who are perishing –
097889	to the latter
097890	
097891	an odor
097892	from
097893	death
097894	to
097895	death,
097896	the former
097897	but
097898	a fragrance
097899	from
097900	life
097901	to
097902	to life.
097903	
097904	for these things?
097905	
097906	And who
097907	is adequate
097908	not
097909	For
097910	we are
097911	like
097912	
097913	so many
097914	others, hucksters who peddle
097915	
097916	the word
097917	
097918	of God
097919	for profit, but
097920	as
097921	persons of
097922	sincerity,
097923	
097924	as
097925	persons sent from
097926	God
097927	before
097928	God.
097929	in
097930	Christ
097931	we are speaking
097932	Are we beginning
097933	again?
097934	ourselves
097935	to commend
097936	
097937	We don’t
097938	need
097939	as
097940	some other people do, do we?
097941	of recommendation
097942	letters
097943	to you
097944	
097945	or
097946	from you
097947	
097948	
097949	our letter,
097950	
097951	
097952	You yourselves are
097953	written
097954	on
097955	
097956	our hearts,
097957	
097958	known
097959	
097960	and read
097961	by
097962	everyone,
097963	
097964	revealing
097965	
097966	that you are
097967	a letter
097968	of Christ,
097969	delivered
097970	by us,
097971	
097972	written
097973	not
097974	with ink
097975	but
097976	by the Spirit
097977	God,
097978	of the living
097979	not
097980	on
097981	tablets
097982	stone
097983	but
097984	on
097985	tablets
097986	hearts.
097987	of human
097988	confidence
097989	Now
097990	such
097991	we have
097992	through
097993	
097994	Christ.
097995	in
097996	
097997	God
097998	Not
097999	
098000	in
098001	ourselves
098002	adequate
098003	that we are
098004	to consider
098005	anything
098006	as
098007	if it were coming from
098008	ourselves,
098009	but
098010	
098011	our adequacy
098012	
098013	is from
098014	
098015	God,
098016	who
098017	
098018	adequate
098019	made us
098020	to be servants
098021	of a new
098022	covenant
098023	not
098024	based on the letter
098025	but
098026	on the Spirit,
098027	
098028	for
098029	the letter
098030	kills,
098031	
098032	but
098033	the Spirit
098034	gives life.
098035	if
098036	But
098037	
098038	the ministry
098039	
098040	that produced death –
098041	in
098042	letters
098043	carved
098044	stone tablets –
098045	came
098046	with
098047	glory,
098048	so that
098049	not
098050	could
098051	keep their eyes fixed
098052	
098053	
098054	the Israelites
098055	on
098056	
098057	on the face
098058	of Moses
098059	because
098060	
098061	of the glory
098062	
098063	of his face
098064	
098065	
098066	(a glory which was made ineffective),
098067	how much
098068	
098069	more
098070	
098071	will the ministry
098072	
098073	of the Spirit
098074	be?
098075	
098076	glorious
098077	if
098078	For
098079	
098080	in the ministry
098081	
098082	that produced condemnation,
098083	there was glory
098084	how much
098085	more
098086	excel
098087	
098088	does the ministry
098089	
098090	that produces righteousness
098091	in glory!
098092	
098093	For
098094	now has no
098095	indeed, what had been glorious
098096	
098097	glory
098098	
098099	
098100	
098101	
098102	because of
098103	
098104	the tremendously greater
098105	glory of what replaced it.
098106	if
098107	For
098108	
098109	what was made ineffective
098110	came with
098111	glory,
098112	how much
098113	more
098114	
098115	has what remains
098116	come in
098117	glory!
098118	since we have
098119	Therefore,
098120	such
098121	a hope,
098122	with great
098123	boldness,
098124	we behave
098125	
098126	and not
098127	like
098128	Moses
098129	who used to put
098130	a veil
098131	over
098132	
098133	his face
098134	
098135	to
098136	
098137	keep
098138	from staring
098139	
098140	
098141	the Israelites
098142	at
098143	
098144	the result
098145	
098146	of the glory that was made ineffective.
098147	But
098148	were closed.
098149	
098150	their minds
098151	
098152	to
098153	For
098154	
098155	this very
098156	day,
098157	
098158	
098159	the same veil
098160	
098161	
098162	read.
098163	
098164	when they hear the old
098165	covenant
098166	remains
098167	It has not
098168	been removed
098169	
098170	because only in
098171	Christ
098172	is it taken away.
098173	But
098174	until
098175	this very day
098176	whenever
098177	
098178	is read,
098179	Moses
098180	a veil
098181	over
098182	
098183	their minds,
098184	
098185	lies
098186	when
098187	but
098188	
098189	one turns
098190	to
098191	the Lord,
098192	is removed.
098193	
098194	the veil
098195	
098196	Now
098197	the Lord
098198	
098199	the Spirit,
098200	is
098201	where
098202	and
098203	
098204	the Spirit
098205	of the Lord
098206	is present, there is freedom.
098207	
098208	And
098209	we all,
098210	with unveiled
098211	faces
098212	
098213	the glory
098214	of the Lord,
098215	reflecting
098216	
098217	
098218	into the same image
098219	are being transformed
098220	from
098221	one degree of glory
098222	to
098223	another,
098224	
098225	which is from
098226	the Lord,
098227	who is the Spirit.
098228	
098229	Therefore,
098230	since we have
098231	
098232	this ministry,
098233	
098234	just as
098235	God has shown
098236	us mercy, we do not
098237	become discouraged.
098238	But
098239	we have rejected
098240	
098241	hidden deeds,
098242	
098243	shameful
098244	not
098245	behaving
098246	with
098247	deceptiveness
098248	or
098249	distorting
098250	
098251	the word
098252	
098253	of God,
098254	but
098255	
098256	by open proclamation
098257	
098258	of the truth
098259	we commend
098260	ourselves
098261	to
098262	everyone’s
098263	conscience
098264	
098265	before
098266	
098267	God.
098268	even if
098269	But
098270	
098271	is
098272	veiled,
098273	
098274	our gospel
098275	
098276	only to
098277	
098278	those who are perishing,
098279	it is
098280	veiled
098281	among
098282	whom
098283	
098284	the god
098285	
098286	of this age
098287	
098288	has blinded
098289	
098290	the minds
098291	
098292	of those who do not believe
098293	so
098294	
098295	they would not
098296	see
098297	
098298	the light
098299	
098300	gospel
098301	
098302	of the glorious
098303	
098304	of Christ,
098305	who
098306	is
098307	the image
098308	
098309	of God.
098310	we do not
098311	For
098312	ourselves,
098313	proclaim
098314	but
098315	Jesus
098316	Christ
098317	as Lord,
098318	ourselves
098319	and
098320	as your slaves
098321	
098322	for
098323	Jesus’ sake.
098324	
098325	
098326	For God,
098327	
098328	who said
098329	out of
098330	darkness,”
098331	“Let light
098332	shine
098333	is the one who
098334	shined
098335	in
098336	
098337	our hearts
098338	
098339	to
098340	give us the light
098341	
098342	knowledge
098343	
098344	of the glorious
098345	
098346	of God
098347	in
098348	the face
098349	
098350	of Christ.
098351	we have
098352	But
098353	
098354	this treasure
098355	
098356	in
098357	clay
098358	jars,
098359	so that
098360	
098361	the extraordinary
098362	
098363	power
098364	belongs to
098365	
098366	God
098367	
098368	and does not
098369	come from us.
098370	
098371	on
098372	every
098373	We are experiencing trouble
098374	side, but
098375	are not
098376	crushed;
098377	we are perplexed,
098378	but
098379	not
098380	driven to despair;
098381	we are persecuted,
098382	but
098383	not
098384	abandoned;
098385	we are knocked down,
098386	but
098387	not
098388	destroyed,
098389	always
098390	
098391	the death
098392	
098393	of Jesus,
098394	in
098395	
098396	our body
098397	carrying around
098398	so that
098399	
098400	
098401	the life
098402	
098403	of Jesus
098404	in
098405	
098406	our body.
098407	
098408	may also be made visible
098409	are constantly
098410	For
098411	
098412	
098413	we who are alive
098414	to
098415	death
098416	being handed over
098417	for
098418	Jesus’
098419	sake, so that
098420	
098421	
098422	the life
098423	
098424	of Jesus
098425	may also be made visible
098426	in
098427	
098428	our mortal
098429	body.
098430	
098431	As a result,
098432	
098433	death
098434	in us,
098435	
098436	is at work
098437	
098438	but
098439	life
098440	is at work in you.
098441	
098442	since we have
098443	But
098444	
098445	
098446	the same spirit
098447	
098448	of faith
098449	as that shown in
098450	
098451	what has been written,
098452	“I believed;
098453	therefore
098454	I spoke,”
098455	
098456	
098457	also believe,
098458	therefore we also speak.
098459	
098460	we
098461	We do so because we know
098462	
098463	
098464	that the one who raised up
098465	
098466	
098467	Jesus
098468	
098469	
098470	up with
098471	Jesus
098472	will also raise us
098473	
098474	and will bring
098475	us with you into his presence.
098476	
098477	
098478	For
098479	all these things
098480	are for
098481	
098482	so that
098483	
098484	the grace
098485	that is including more
098486	your sake,
098487	
098488	and more
098489	
098490	people may cause thanksgiving
098491	to increase
098492	to
098493	
098494	the glory
098495	
098496	of God.
098497	Therefore
098498	we do not
098499	despair,
098500	but
098501	even if
098502	
098503	
098504	our physical body
098505	
098506	person
098507	is wearing away,
098508	
098509	
098510	our inner
098511	
098512	is being renewed
098513	day
098514	
098515	by day.
098516	
098517	For
098518	our momentary,
098519	light
098520	
098521	suffering
098522	
098523	
098524	far beyond
098525	
098526	all comparison
098527	an eternal
098528	weight
098529	of glory
098530	is producing for us
098531	
098532	because we are not
098533	looking at
098534	
098535	
098536	what can be seen
098537	
098538	
098539	at what cannot
098540	be seen.
098541	
098542	For
098543	what can be seen
098544	is temporary,
098545	
098546	but
098547	but what cannot
098548	be seen
098549	is eternal.
098550	we know
098551	For
098552	
098553	that if
098554	
098555	our earthly
098556	
098557	house,
098558	
098559	the tent
098560	we live in, is dismantled,
098561	a building
098562	from
098563	God,
098564	we have
098565	a house
098566	not built by human hands,
098567	that is eternal
098568	in
098569	
098570	the heavens.
098571	
098572	For
098573	in
098574	
098575	we groan,
098576	
098577	this earthly house
098578	
098579	
098580	
098581	our heavenly dwelling,
098582	to put on
098583	because we desire
098584	if
098585	indeed,
098586	
098587	after we have put on
098588	our heavenly house, we will not
098589	naked.
098590	be found
098591	
098592	For
098593	
098594	while we are
098595	in
098596	
098597	this tent,
098598	we groan
098599	since we are weighed down,
098600	
098601	
098602	because we do not
098603	want
098604	to be unclothed,
098605	but
098606	clothed,
098607	so that
098608	may be swallowed up
098609	
098610	what is mortal
098611	by
098612	
098613	life.
098614	
098615	Now
098616	the one who prepared us
098617	
098618	for
098619	
098620	
098621	this very purpose is God,
098622	
098623	who gave us
098624	
098625	
098626	as a down payment.
098627	
098628	the Spirit
098629	full of courage,
098630	Therefore
098631	we are always
098632	
098633	and we know
098634	
098635	here on earth
098636	
098637	
098638	that as long as we are alive
098639	we are absent
098640	from
098641	
098642	the Lord –
098643	by
098644	faith,
098645	for
098646	we live
098647	not
098648	by
098649	sight.
098650	we are full of courage
098651	Thus
098652	
098653	and would prefer
098654	
098655	to be away
098656	from
098657	
098658	the body
098659	
098660	and at home
098661	with
098662	
098663	the Lord.
098664	So then
098665	
098666	we make
098667	whether
098668	we are alive
098669	or
098670	away,
098671	it our ambition to please him.
098672	
098673	
098674	
098675	For
098676	all
098677	
098678	appear
098679	we must
098680	before
098681	
098682	the judgment seat
098683	
098684	of Christ,
098685	so that
098686	may be paid back
098687	each one
098688	
098689	according to
098690	
098691	while in the body,
098692	
098693	what
098694	he has done
098695	whether
098696	good
098697	or
098698	evil.
098699	because we know
098700	Therefore,
098701	
098702	the fear
098703	
098704	of the Lord,
098705	people,
098706	we try to persuade
098707	to God,
098708	but
098709	we are well known
098710	and I hope
098711	
098712	
098713	
098714	
098715	
098716	
098717	we are well known to your consciences too.
098718	We are not
098719	again,
098720	ourselves to you
098721	trying to commend
098722	
098723	but
098724	an opportunity
098725	are giving you
098726	
098727	to be proud
098728	of us,
098729	
098730	so that
098731	you may be able
098732	
098733	
098734	in
098735	outward appearance
098736	to answer those who take pride
098737	
098738	and not
098739	in what is in
098740	the heart.
098741	if
098742	For
098743	we are out of
098744	our minds, it is for God;
098745	if
098746	we are of sound mind,
098747	it is for you.
098748	
098749	For
098750	the love
098751	
098752	
098753	controls us,
098754	
098755	since we have concluded this,
098756	
098757	
098758	of Christ
098759	for
098760	all;
098761	that Christ died
098762	therefore
098763	
098764	all
098765	have died.
098766	
098767	for
098768	all
098769	And he died
098770	so that
098771	
098772	those who live
098773	should no longer
098774	for themselves
098775	live
098776	but
098777	
098778	for them
098779	
098780	for him who died
098781	
098782	and was raised.
098783	So then
098784	
098785	from
098786	
098787	now
098788	no one
098789	on we acknowledge
098790	from
098791	an outward human point of view.
098792	Even though
098793	
098794	we have known
098795	from
098796	such a human point of view,
098797	Christ
098798	
098799	now
098800	him in that way any longer.
098801	we do not know
098802	So then,
098803	if
098804	anyone
098805	is in
098806	Christ,
098807	he is a new
098808	creation;
098809	
098810	what is old
098811	has passed away –
098812	look,
098813	has come!
098814	what is new
098815	
098816	And
098817	all these things
098818	are from
098819	
098820	God
098821	
098822	who reconciled us
098823	
098824	to himself
098825	through
098826	Christ,
098827	
098828	and who has given us
098829	
098830	
098831	the ministry
098832	
098833	of reconciliation.
098834	
098835	In other words,
098836	God
098837	was
098838	in
098839	Christ
098840	the world
098841	reconciling
098842	to himself,
098843	not
098844	counting
098845	
098846	
098847	people’s trespasses against them,
098848	
098849	
098850	and he has given us
098851	
098852	
098853	
098854	the message
098855	
098856	of reconciliation.
098857	for
098858	Christ,
098859	Therefore
098860	we are ambassadors
098861	as though
098862	
098863	God
098864	were making his plea
098865	through us.
098866	
098867	We plead
098868	with you on
098869	Christ’s
098870	behalf, “Be reconciled
098871	
098872	to God!”
098873	
098874	the one who did not
098875	know
098876	sin
098877	for us,
098878	
098879	to be sin
098880	God made
098881	so that
098882	
098883	we would become
098884	the righteousness
098885	of God.
098886	in him
098887	
098888	because we are fellow workers,
098889	Now
098890	
098891	we also urge you
098892	not
098893	in
098894	vain.
098895	
098896	the grace
098897	
098898	of God
098899	to receive
098900	
098901	he says,
098902	For
098903	time,
098904	at the acceptable
098905	“I heard you
098906	
098907	
098908	and in
098909	the day
098910	of salvation
098911	I helped you.”
098912	
098913	Look,
098914	now
098915	time;
098916	is the acceptable
098917	look,
098918	now
098919	is the day
098920	of salvation!
098921	We do not
098922	
098923	anyone
098924	give
098925	an occasion for taking an offense
098926	in anything, so that
098927	no
098928	fault
098929	
098930	may be found with our ministry.
098931	But
098932	in
098933	every
098934	we have commended
098935	ourselves
098936	as
098937	God’s
098938	servants,
098939	way, with
098940	endurance,
098941	great
098942	in
098943	persecutions,
098944	in
098945	difficulties,
098946	in
098947	distresses,
098948	in
098949	beatings,
098950	in
098951	imprisonments,
098952	in
098953	riots,
098954	in
098955	troubles,
098956	in
098957	sleepless nights,
098958	in
098959	hunger,
098960	by
098961	purity,
098962	by
098963	knowledge,
098964	by
098965	patience,
098966	by
098967	benevolence,
098968	by
098969	Spirit,
098970	the Holy
098971	by
098972	love,
098973	genuine
098974	by
098975	teaching,
098976	truthful
098977	by
098978	the power
098979	of God,
098980	with
098981	
098982	weapons
098983	
098984	of righteousness
098985	
098986	both for the right hand
098987	
098988	and for the left,
098989	through
098990	glory
098991	
098992	and dishonor,
098993	through
098994	slander
098995	
098996	and praise;
098997	regarded as
098998	impostors,
098999	
099000	and yet true;
099001	as
099002	unknown,
099003	
099004	and yet well-known;
099005	as
099006	dying
099007	
099008	and yet – see! –
099009	we continue to live;
099010	as
099011	those who are scourged
099012	
099013	and yet not
099014	executed;
099015	as
099016	sorrowful,
099017	always
099018	but
099019	rejoicing,
099020	as
099021	poor,
099022	many
099023	but
099024	making
099025	rich, as
099026	nothing,
099027	having
099028	
099029	everything.
099030	and yet possessing
099031	
099032	We have spoken
099033	
099034	freely
099035	to you,
099036	
099037	Corinthians;
099038	
099039	our heart
099040	
099041	has been opened wide to you.
099042	Our affection for you is not
099043	restricted,
099044	in
099045	
099046	you are restricted
099047	but
099048	for us.
099049	
099050	your affections
099051	
099052	
099053	Now
099054	as a fair
099055	exchange –
099056	as
099057	to my children –
099058	I speak
099059	open wide
099060	also.
099061	your hearts to us
099062	Do not
099063	become
099064	partners
099065	with those who do not believe,
099066	what
099067	for
099068	partnership
099069	is there between righteousness
099070	
099071	and lawlessness,
099072	or
099073	what
099074	fellowship
099075	does light
099076	have with
099077	darkness?
099078	what
099079	And
099080	agreement
099081	does Christ
099082	have with
099083	Beliar?
099084	Or
099085	what
099086	share in common
099087	does a believer
099088	with
099089	an unbeliever?
099090	what
099091	And
099092	mutual agreement
099093	does the temple
099094	of God
099095	have with
099096	idols?
099097	
099098	For
099099	we are the temple
099100	God,
099101	and I will be
099102	of the living
099103	just as
099104	said,
099105	
099106	God
099107	
099108	“I will live
099109	in them
099110	
099111	
099112	and will walk among them,
099113	
099114	and they will be
099115	
099116	their God,
099117	
099118	
099119	
099120	
099121	my people.”
099122	Therefore
099123	“come out
099124	from
099125	their midst,
099126	
099127	
099128	and be separate,”
099129	says
099130	the Lord,
099131	
099132	unclean thing,
099133	no
099134	“and touch
099135	and I
099136	will welcome you,
099137	
099138	
099139	and I will be
099140	
099141	
099142	a father to you,
099143	
099144	
099145	and you will be
099146	
099147	
099148	my sons
099149	
099150	and daughters,”
099151	says
099152	Lord.
099153	the All-Powerful
099154	
099155	Therefore,
099156	since we have
099157	
099158	these promises,
099159	dear friends,
099160	let us cleanse
099161	ourselves
099162	from
099163	everything
099164	that could defile
099165	the body
099166	
099167	and the spirit,
099168	and thus accomplish
099169	holiness
099170	out of
099171	reverence
099172	for God.
099173	Make room for us
099174	
099175	no one,
099176	in your hearts; we have wronged
099177	no one,
099178	we have ruined
099179	no one.
099180	we have exploited
099181	this to
099182	condemn you,
099183	I do not
099184	say
099185	I told you before
099186	for
099187	that
099188	in
099189	
099190	our hearts
099191	
099192	you are
099193	so that
099194	
099195	we die together
099196	
099197	and live together with you.
099198	I have great
099199	
099200	confidence
099201	in you;
099202	
099203	I take great
099204	
099205	pride
099206	on
099207	
099208	your behalf. I am filled
099209	
099210	with encouragement;
099211	I am overflowing
099212	
099213	with joy
099214	in the midst of
099215	all
099216	
099217	our suffering.
099218	
099219	
099220	For
099221	even when we came
099222	
099223	into
099224	Macedonia,
099225	no
099226	had
099227	rest at all,
099228	
099229	our body
099230	
099231	but
099232	in
099233	every way –
099234	we were troubled
099235	from the outside,
099236	struggles
099237	from within.
099238	fears
099239	But
099240	
099241	who encourages
099242	
099243	the downhearted,
099244	encouraged us
099245	
099246	
099247	God,
099248	by
099249	
099250	the arrival
099251	of Titus.
099252	We were encouraged not
099253	only
099254	
099255	by
099256	
099257	his arrival,
099258	
099259	but
099260	
099261	also by
099262	
099263	the encouragement
099264	
099265	you gave
099266	
099267	
099268	him, as he reported to us
099269	
099270	
099271	
099272	your longing,
099273	
099274	
099275	your mourning,
099276	
099277	
099278	your deep concern
099279	for me,
099280	
099281	so that
099282	
099283	more than ever.
099284	I rejoiced
099285	
099286	For even if
099287	
099288	sad
099289	I made you
099290	by
099291	
099292	my letter,
099293	I do not
099294	regret
099295	having written it (even though
099296	
099297	I did regret
099298	I see
099299	it, for
099300	
099301	
099302	that my letter made you
099303	
099304	though
099305	
099306	only for
099307	a short time).
099308	sad,
099309	
099310	Now
099311	I rejoice,
099312	not
099313	
099314	because you were made sad,
099315	but
099316	
099317	because you were made sad
099318	to the point of
099319	repentance.
099320	you were made sad
099321	For
099322	as
099323	God
099324	intended, so that
099325	in
099326	you were not
099327	harmed any way
099328	by us.
099329	
099330	
099331	For
099332	as intended by
099333	God
099334	sadness
099335	produces a repentance
099336	to
099337	salvation,
099338	leaving no regret,
099339	that leads
099340	
099341	but
099342	
099343	worldly
099344	sadness
099345	death.
099346	brings about
099347	see
099348	For
099349	
099350	
099351	
099352	as
099353	God
099354	what this very thing, this sadness
099355	
099356	intended, has produced in you:
099357	
099358	what eagerness,
099359	
099360	what defense
099361	
099362	of yourselves, what indignation,
099363	
099364	what alarm,
099365	
099366	what longing,
099367	
099368	what deep concern,
099369	
099370	what punishment!
099371	In
099372	everything
099373	you have proved
099374	yourselves
099375	innocent
099376	to be
099377	
099378	in this matter.
099379	So then,
099380	even though
099381	
099382	I wrote to you,
099383	
099384	it was not
099385	on account of
099386	
099387	the one who did wrong,
099388	or
099389	on account
099390	of the one who
099391	was wronged,
099392	but
099393	
099394	
099395	to reveal
099396	
099397	your eagerness
099398	
099399	
099400	on
099401	our behalf
099402	to
099403	you
099404	before
099405	
099406	God.
099407	
099408	Therefore
099409	we have been encouraged.
099410	in addition to
099411	And
099412	
099413	our own encouragement,
099414	
099415	even
099416	more
099417	we rejoiced
099418	at
099419	
099420	the joy
099421	of Titus,
099422	
099423	of you have refreshed
099424	
099425	his spirit.
099426	
099427	
099428	because all
099429	
099430	
099431	For if
099432	anything concerning you,
099433	
099434	about
099435	
099436	I have boasted to him
099437	I have not
099438	been embarrassed
099439	by you, but
099440	just as
099441	everything
099442	
099443	was true,
099444	we said to you
099445	
099446	so
099447	
099448	
099449	our boasting
099450	
099451	
099452	to
099453	Titus
099454	true as well.
099455	about you has proved
099456	
099457	
099458	And his affection
099459	
099460	much greater
099461	for
099462	
099463	you is
099464	when he remembers
099465	
099466	all,
099467	
099468	the obedience of you
099469	how
099470	with
099471	fear
099472	
099473	and trembling.
099474	you welcomed him
099475	
099476	I rejoice
099477	
099478	because in
099479	everything
099480	I am fully confident
099481	in you.
099482	
099483	we make known to you,
099484	Now
099485	
099486	brothers
099487	
099488	and sisters, the grace
099489	
099490	of God
099491	
099492	given
099493	
099494	
099495	to the churches
099496	
099497	of Macedonia,
099498	
099499	that during
099500	a severe
099501	ordeal
099502	of suffering,
099503	
099504	their abundant
099505	
099506	joy
099507	
099508	
099509	
099510	
099511	and their extreme
099512	poverty
099513	
099514	have overflowed
099515	in
099516	
099517	the wealth
099518	
099519	of their generosity.
099520	
099521	
099522	they gave according to
099523	their means
099524	For I testify,
099525	
099526	and beyond
099527	their means.
099528	They did so voluntarily,
099529	with
099530	great
099531	earnestness
099532	begging us
099533	
099534	
099535	for the blessing
099536	
099537	
099538	and fellowship
099539	
099540	of helping
099541	
099542	
099543	
099544	the saints.
099545	
099546	And they did this not
099547	just as
099548	we had hoped,
099549	but
099550	themselves
099551	they gave
099552	first
099553	
099554	to the Lord
099555	
099556	
099557	and to us by
099558	the will
099559	of God.
099560	Thus
099561	
099562	we urged
099563	
099564	Titus
099565	that,
099566	just as
099567	he had previously begun
099568	this work, so
099569	
099570	also he should complete
099571	for you.
099572	
099573	
099574	
099575	this act of kindness
099576	
099577	But
099578	as
099579	in
099580	everything –
099581	you excel
099582	in faith,
099583	
099584	in speech,
099585	
099586	in knowledge,
099587	
099588	and in all
099589	eagerness
099590	
099591	
099592	from us
099593	
099594	that is in you –
099595	
099596	and in the love
099597	make sure that
099598	
099599	in
099600	
099601	
099602	this act of kindness too.
099603	you excel
099604	I am not
099605	this as
099606	a command,
099607	saying
099608	but
099609	by comparison with
099610	
099611	of others.
099612	the eagerness
099613	
099614	
099615	
099616	of your
099617	love
099618	the genuineness
099619	I am testing
099620	you know
099621	For
099622	
099623	the grace
099624	
099625	of our Lord
099626	
099627	Jesus
099628	Christ,
099629	
099630	for
099631	
099632	he became poor
099633	rich,
099634	that although he was
099635	your sakes, so that you
099636	
099637	
099638	by his
099639	poverty
099640	could become rich.
099641	
099642	my opinion
099643	on
099644	
099645	So here is
099646	
099647	
099648	
099649	this matter: It is to your advantage,
099650	
099651	
099652	both
099653	
099654	in your giving
099655	
099656	
099657	
099658	and your desire to give,
099659	since you made a good start
099660	
099661	last year
099662	
099663	
099664	
099665	
099666	what you started,
099667	to finish
099668	so that
099669	just as
099670	
099671	to do it eagerly,
099672	
099673	you wanted
099674	
099675	
099676	
099677	you can also complete
099678	it according to
099679	
099680	your means.
099681	if
099682	For
099683	
099684	the eagerness
099685	is present,
099686	according to
099687	whatever
099688	one has,
099689	the gift itself is acceptable
099690	not
099691	according to
099692	what he does not
099693	have.
099694	I do not
099695	For
099696	say this so
099697	for others
099698	there would be relief
099699	
099700	and suffering for you,
099701	but
099702	as a matter of
099703	equality.
099704	At
099705	
099706	the present
099707	time,
099708	
099709	
099710	your abundance
099711	
099712	
099713	
099714	will meet their need,
099715	so that
099716	
099717	
099718	
099719	one day their abundance
099720	may also meet
099721	
099722	
099723	
099724	your need,
099725	and thus
099726	there may be
099727	equality,
099728	as
099729	it is written:
099730	
099731	
099732	“The one who gathered much
099733	did not
099734	have too much,
099735	
099736	
099737	
099738	and the one who gathered little
099739	did not
099740	have too little.”
099741	thanks
099742	But
099743	
099744	be to God
099745	
099746	who put
099747	
099748	
099749	the same devotion
099750	I have for you,
099751	
099752	in
099753	
099754	the heart
099755	of Titus
099756	
099757	
099758	because he not only
099759	
099760	accepted
099761	very eager,
099762	our request, but
099763	since he was
099764	of his own accord.
099765	he is coming
099766	to you
099767	
099768	we are sending
099769	And
099770	along with him
099771	
099772	
099773	the brother
099774	who
099775	
099776	is praised
099777	for his work in
099778	
099779	spreading the gospel.
099780	by
099781	all
099782	
099783	the churches
099784	
099785	In addition,
099786	
099787	
099788	
099789	this brother has also been chosen
099790	by
099791	
099792	the churches
099793	as our traveling companion
099794	
099795	
099796	
099797	this generous gift
099798	
099799	
099800	as we administer
099801	
099802	
099803	to
099804	
099805	
099806	
099807	of the Lord himself
099808	the glory
099809	
099810	and to show our readiness to help.
099811	
099812	We did
099813	
099814	this as a precaution so that no
099815	one
099816	
099817	should blame us
099818	in regard to
099819	
099820	this generous gift
099821	
099822	
099823	we are administering.
099824	
099825	
099826	we are concerned
099827	For
099828	about what is right
099829	not
099830	only
099831	before
099832	the Lord
099833	but
099834	
099835	also before
099836	men.
099837	we are sending with them
099838	And
099839	
099840	
099841	our brother
099842	
099843	whom
099844	we have tested
099845	in
099846	many matters,
099847	many times
099848	eager
099849	and found
099850	who now
099851	but
099852	is much
099853	more eager
099854	confidence
099855	than ever because of the great
099856	
099857	he has in you.
099858	
099859	If
099860	there is any question about
099861	Titus,
099862	partner
099863	he is my
099864	
099865	among you;
099866	
099867	and fellow worker
099868	if
099869	there is any question about our brothers,
099870	
099871	they are messengers
099872	of the churches,
099873	a glory
099874	to Christ.
099875	
099876	Therefore
099877	the proof
099878	
099879	of your love
099880	
099881	
099882	
099883	and of our pride
099884	in you.
099885	
099886	before
099887	
099888	show them
099889	
099890	openly
099891	
099892	the churches
099893	about
099894	
099895	For
099896	
099897	this service
099898	
099899	to
099900	
099901	the saints,
099902	not necessary for me
099903	
099904	it is
099905	
099906	to write you
099907	
099908	I know
099909	because
099910	
099911	your eagerness to help.
099912	
099913	
099914	about
099915	
099916	I keep boasting
099917	to the Macedonians
099918	
099919	this eagerness of yours, that Achaia
099920	has been ready
099921	to give since
099922	last year,
099923	
099924	
099925	
099926	and your zeal
099927	to participate has stirred up
099928	
099929	most of them.
099930	I am sending
099931	But
099932	
099933	these brothers
099934	
099935	so that
099936	
099937	our boasting
099938	
099939	
099940	about
099941	
099942	you may not be empty
099943	in
099944	
099945	this case,
099946	
099947	so that
099948	just as
099949	I kept telling them.
099950	ready
099951	you may be
099952	(not
099953	For
099954	if
099955	should come
099956	with me
099957	
099958	any of the Macedonians
099959	
099960	and find that you
099961	
099962	are not ready
099963	to give, we would be humiliated
099964	
099965	
099966	
099967	to mention
099968	
099969	you) by
099970	
099971	this confidence we had in you.
099972	
099973	it necessary
099974	Therefore
099975	I thought
099976	to urge
099977	
099978	these brothers
099979	to
099980	go
099981	to
099982	you in advance
099983	
099984	and to arrange ahead of time
099985	
099986	you had promised,
099987	the generous contribution
099988	
099989	
099990	ready
099991	so this may be
099992	
099993	as
099994	a generous gift
099995	
099996	and not
099997	as
099998	something you feel forced to do.
099999	
100000	
100001	
100002	My point is this: The person who sows
100003	sparingly
100004	sparingly,
100005	
100006	will also reap
100007	
100008	
100009	and the person who sows
100010	
100011	generously
100012	
100013	generously.
100014	
100015	will also reap
100016	Each one
100017	of you should give just as
100018	he has decided
100019	
100020	in his heart,
100021	not
100022	under
100023	reluctantly
100024	or
100025	
100026	compulsion,
100027	a cheerful
100028	because
100029	giver.
100030	loves
100031	
100032	God
100033	is able
100034	And
100035	
100036	God
100037	all
100038	grace
100039	to make
100040	to you
100041	
100042	so that
100043	in
100044	of everything
100045	at all times,
100046	every way
100047	enough
100048	because you have
100049	overflow
100050	you will overflow in
100051	every
100052	work.
100053	good
100054	Just as
100055	it is written,
100056	“He has scattered widely,
100057	he has given
100058	
100059	to the poor;
100060	
100061	his righteousness
100062	
100063	remains
100064	
100065	
100066	forever.”
100067	
100068	Now
100069	God who provides
100070	seed
100071	
100072	for the sower
100073	
100074	and bread
100075	for
100076	food
100077	will provide
100078	
100079	and multiply
100080	
100081	your supply of seed
100082	
100083	
100084	to grow.
100085	
100086	and will cause the harvest
100087	
100088	of your righteousness
100089	
100090	in
100091	every way
100092	You will be enriched
100093	on
100094	every
100095	so that you may be generous
100096	occasion, which
100097	is producing
100098	through us
100099	
100100	thanksgiving
100101	
100102	to God,
100103	
100104	
100105	because the service
100106	
100107	of this ministry
100108	
100109	not
100110	only
100111	is
100112	providing
100113	
100114	for the needs
100115	
100116	of the saints
100117	but
100118	
100119	is also overflowing
100120	with
100121	many
100122	thanks
100123	
100124	to God.
100125	Through
100126	
100127	the evidence
100128	
100129	of this service
100130	
100131	they will glorify
100132	
100133	God
100134	because of
100135	
100136	your obedience
100137	
100138	to your confession
100139	
100140	in
100141	
100142	the gospel
100143	
100144	of Christ
100145	
100146	and the generosity
100147	
100148	of your sharing
100149	with them
100150	
100151	
100152	and with
100153	everyone.
100154	
100155	
100156	And in their prayers
100157	on your behalf
100158	
100159	they long for you
100160	
100161	because of
100162	
100163	the extraordinary
100164	grace
100165	
100166	God
100167	has shown to you.
100168	
100169	Thanks
100170	
100171	be to God
100172	for
100173	
100174	his indescribable
100175	
100176	gift!
100177	
100178	Now
100179	
100180	I, Paul,
100181	appeal to you
100182	
100183	personally by
100184	
100185	the meekness
100186	
100187	and gentleness
100188	
100189	of Christ
100190	(I who
100191	when
100192	present
100193	
100194	am meek
100195	among you,
100196	
100197	you when away!) –
100198	but
100199	am full of courage
100200	toward
100201	
100202	I ask
100203	now
100204	
100205	I may not
100206	that when I am present
100207	have to be bold
100208	
100209	with the confidence
100210	that
100211	(I expect)
100212	I will dare
100213	to use against
100214	some
100215	
100216	who consider us
100217	
100218	
100219	according to
100220	human standards.
100221	to be behaving
100222	as
100223	human beings,
100224	For
100225	though we live
100226	we do not
100227	according to
100228	human standards,
100229	wage war
100230	
100231	for
100232	the weapons
100233	
100234	of our warfare
100235	
100236	are not
100237	human weapons,
100238	but
100239	are made powerful
100240	
100241	by God
100242	for
100243	tearing down
100244	strongholds.
100245	arguments
100246	We tear down
100247	
100248	and every
100249	arrogant obstacle
100250	that is raised up
100251	against
100252	
100253	the knowledge
100254	
100255	of God,
100256	
100257	and we take
100258	every
100259	thought
100260	captive to
100261	
100262	make it obey
100263	
100264	Christ.
100265	
100266	
100267	We are also ready
100268	
100269	to punish
100270	every
100271	act of disobedience,
100272	whenever
100273	is complete.
100274	
100275	
100276	your obedience
100277	
100278	outward
100279	appearances.
100280	You are looking at
100281	If
100282	anyone
100283	is confident
100284	that he
100285	to Christ,
100286	belongs
100287	
100288	he should reflect
100289	on this again:
100290	
100291	
100292	
100293	Just as
100294	
100295	he himself belongs to Christ,
100296	so too do we.
100297	
100298	
100299	if
100300	
100301	For
100302	more
100303	somewhat
100304	I boast
100305	about
100306	
100307	our authority
100308	
100309	that
100310	gave
100311	
100312	the Lord
100313	us for
100314	building
100315	
100316	you up and not
100317	for
100318	tearing you
100319	
100320	down, I will not
100321	be ashamed of doing so.
100322	
100323	I do not
100324	want to seem
100325	as
100326	
100327	though I am trying to terrify you
100328	
100329	with
100330	
100331	my letters,
100332	
100333	
100334	“His letters
100335	
100336	because some say,
100337	are weighty
100338	
100339	and forceful,
100340	
100341	but
100342	presence
100343	
100344	his physical
100345	is weak
100346	
100347	
100348	and his speech
100349	is of no account.”
100350	
100351	consider this:
100352	
100353	Let such a person
100354	
100355	What
100356	we say
100357	
100358	
100359	by
100360	letters
100361	when we are absent,
100362	
100363	
100364	when we are present.
100365	
100366	we also are in actions
100367	we would not
100368	For
100369	dare
100370	to classify
100371	or
100372	compare
100373	ourselves
100374	with some
100375	
100376	themselves.
100377	of those who recommend
100378	But
100379	
100380	
100381	themselves
100382	by themselves
100383	when they measure
100384	
100385	and compare
100386	themselves
100387	with themselves,
100388	they are without
100389	understanding.
100390	
100391	But
100392	we will not
100393	beyond
100394	
100395	certain limits,
100396	boast
100397	but
100398	will confine our boasting according to
100399	
100400	the limits
100401	
100402	of the work
100403	to which
100404	has appointed us,
100405	
100406	
100407	God
100408	
100409	that reaches
100410	even as far as you.
100411	
100412	
100413	we were not
100414	For
100415	as though
100416	we did not
100417	reach
100418	as far as you,
100419	
100420	overextending
100421	ourselves,
100422	as far as
100423	because
100424	
100425	you
100426	we were the first to reach
100427	with
100428	the
100429	gospel
100430	
100431	about Christ.
100432	Nor
100433	beyond
100434	
100435	certain limits
100436	do we boast
100437	done by
100438	others,
100439	in the work
100440	we hope
100441	but
100442	
100443	continues to grow,
100444	
100445	that as your faith
100446	
100447	among you
100448	
100449	our work may be greatly
100450	according to
100451	
100452	our limits,
100453	
100454	
100455	expanded
100456	so that
100457	
100458	in the regions that lie beyond you,
100459	
100460	we may preach the gospel
100461	and not
100462	in
100463	another person’s
100464	area.
100465	
100466	
100467	of work already done
100468	boast
100469	
100470	But
100471	the one who boasts
100472	in
100473	the Lord.
100474	must boast
100475	it is not
100476	For
100477	
100478	himself
100479	who commends
100480	the person
100481	who is
100482	approved,
100483	but
100484	the person
100485	
100486	the Lord
100487	commends.
100488	I wish
100489	that you would be patient with me
100490	
100491	in a little
100492	
100493	foolishness,
100494	but
100495	
100496	indeed you are being patient with me!
100497	
100498	I am jealous for you
100499	For
100500	
100501	with godly
100502	jealousy,
100503	I promised you
100504	because
100505	
100506	in marriage to one
100507	husband,
100508	virgin
100509	you as a pure
100510	to present
100511	
100512	to Christ.
100513	I am afraid
100514	
100515	But
100516	
100517	that just as
100518	
100519	the serpent
100520	deceived
100521	Eve
100522	by
100523	
100524	his treachery,
100525	
100526	may be led astray
100527	
100528	your minds
100529	
100530	from
100531	
100532	a sincere
100533	
100534	
100535	and pure devotion
100536	
100537	to
100538	
100539	Christ.
100540	if
100541	
100542	For
100543	
100544	someone comes
100545	another
100546	Jesus
100547	and proclaims
100548	different from the one
100549	
100550	we proclaimed,
100551	or
100552	spirit
100553	a different
100554	if you receive
100555	than the one
100556	
100557	you received,
100558	or
100559	gospel
100560	a different
100561	than the one
100562	
100563	you accepted,
100564	with it well enough!
100565	you put up
100566	I consider
100567	For
100568	myself not at all
100569	inferior
100570	
100571	
100572	to those “super- apostles.”
100573	even if
100574	And
100575	
100576	I am unskilled
100577	
100578	in speaking,
100579	yet
100580	I am certainly not
100581	
100582	so in knowledge.
100583	Indeed,
100584	in
100585	everything
100586	we have made this plain
100587	in
100588	every way.
100589	to you
100590	
100591	Or
100592	a sin
100593	did I commit
100594	myself
100595	by humbling
100596	so that
100597	
100598	you could be exalted,
100599	
100600	free of charge?
100601	
100602	
100603	of God to you
100604	the gospel
100605	because I proclaimed
100606	
100607	other
100608	churches
100609	I robbed
100610	by receiving
100611	support
100612	from
100613	
100614	
100615	them so that I could serve you!
100616	
100617	When I was
100618	with
100619	
100620	
100621	you and was in need,
100622	I was not
100623	a burden
100624	to anyone,
100625	
100626	for
100627	my needs.
100628	
100629	fully supplied
100630	
100631	the brothers
100632	who came
100633	from
100634	Macedonia
100635	
100636	in
100637	any way,
100638	from being a burden to you
100639	myself
100640	
100641	I kept
100642	
100643	and will continue to do so.
100644	is
100645	As the truth
100646	of Christ
100647	in me,
100648	
100649	
100650	
100651	this boasting
100652	
100653	mine will not
100654	be stopped
100655	of
100656	
100657	in
100658	
100659	the regions
100660	
100661	of Achaia.
100662	
100663	Why?
100664	
100665	Because I do not
100666	love you?
100667	
100668	
100669	God
100670	knows I do!
100671	what
100672	And
100673	I am doing
100674	
100675	I will continue to do,
100676	so that
100677	I may eliminate
100678	
100679	any opportunity
100680	
100681	for those who want
100682	a chance
100683	
100684	our equals in
100685	the things
100686	they boast about.
100687	to be regarded
100688	as
100689	
100690	
100691	
100692	For
100693	such people
100694	are false apostles,
100695	workers,
100696	deceitful
100697	disguising
100698	themselves as
100699	apostles
100700	of Christ.
100701	
100702	And no
100703	wonder,
100704	
100705	for
100706	
100707	even Satan
100708	disguises himself
100709	as
100710	an angel
100711	of light.
100712	it is not
100713	surprising
100714	Therefore
100715	
100716	
100717	
100718	his servants
100719	
100720	also disguise
100721	themselves as
100722	servants
100723	of righteousness,
100724	whose
100725	
100726	end
100727	will correspond
100728	to
100729	
100730	their actions.
100731	
100732	again,
100733	I say
100734	let no
100735	one
100736	
100737	think
100738	a fool.
100739	that I am
100740	if
100741	
100742	But
100743	at least
100744	you do, then
100745	as
100746	a fool,
100747	accept me
100748	
100749	so that
100750	I too
100751	
100752	
100753	may boast a little.
100754	What
100755	I am saying
100756	I do not
100757	the way
100758	the Lord
100759	say
100760	would. Instead
100761	it is, as
100762	with
100763	it were, foolishness.
100764	
100765	
100766	
100767	confidence
100768	
100769	this boastful
100770	Since
100771	many
100772	are boasting
100773	according to
100774	human standards,
100775	I too
100776	will boast.
100777	gladly.
100778	For
100779	you put up
100780	
100781	with fools
100782	so wise,
100783	since you are
100784	you put up with
100785	For
100786	it if
100787	someone
100788	
100789	makes slaves of you,
100790	if
100791	someone
100792	exploits
100793	you, if
100794	someone
100795	takes advantage of you,
100796	if
100797	someone
100798	behaves arrogantly
100799	toward you, if
100800	someone
100801	in
100802	the face.
100803	
100804	strikes you
100805	(To
100806	my disgrace
100807	I must say
100808	
100809	
100810	
100811	that we were too weak
100812	for
100813	that!)
100814	But
100815	whatever
100816	anyone
100817	else dares
100818	
100819	foolishly),
100820	to boast about (I am speaking
100821	dare to boast about the same thing.
100822	I also
100823	they Hebrews?
100824	Are
100825	So am I.
100826	Israelites?
100827	Are they
100828	So am I.
100829	they descendants
100830	of Abraham?
100831	Are
100832	So am I.
100833	they servants
100834	of Christ?
100835	Are
100836	I am out of my mind!)
100837	(I am talking
100838	like
100839	
100840	I am even more so: with
100841	labors,
100842	much greater
100843	with
100844	imprisonments,
100845	far more
100846	with
100847	beatings,
100848	more severe
100849	facing
100850	death
100851	many times.
100852	from
100853	the Jews
100854	Five times
100855	forty
100856	lashes less
100857	one.
100858	I received
100859	Three times
100860	I was beaten with a rod.
100861	Once
100862	I received a stoning.
100863	Three times
100864	I suffered shipwreck.
100865	A night and a day
100866	adrift in
100867	
100868	the open sea.
100869	I spent
100870	I have been on journeys
100871	many times,
100872	in dangers
100873	from rivers,
100874	in dangers
100875	from robbers,
100876	in dangers
100877	from
100878	my own countrymen,
100879	in dangers
100880	from
100881	Gentiles,
100882	in dangers
100883	in
100884	the city,
100885	in dangers
100886	in
100887	the wilderness,
100888	in dangers
100889	at
100890	sea,
100891	in dangers
100892	from
100893	false brothers,
100894	hard work
100895	
100896	and toil,
100897	in
100898	sleepless nights,
100899	many
100900	through
100901	hunger
100902	
100903	and thirst,
100904	in
100905	without food,
100906	many times
100907	in
100908	cold
100909	
100910	and without enough clothing.
100911	Apart from
100912	
100913	other things,
100914	
100915	pressure on me
100916	
100917	
100918	
100919	there is the daily
100920	
100921	of my anxious concern
100922	for all
100923	
100924	the churches.
100925	Who
100926	is weak,
100927	
100928	and I am not
100929	weak?
100930	Who
100931	is led into sin,
100932	
100933	and I do not
100934	
100935	burn with indignation?
100936	If
100937	boast,
100938	I must
100939	
100940	
100941	about the things that show my weakness.
100942	
100943	I will boast
100944	
100945	The God
100946	
100947	and Father
100948	
100949	of the Lord
100950	Jesus,
100951	knows
100952	
100953	who is
100954	blessed
100955	
100956	
100957	forever,
100958	
100959	I am not
100960	lying.
100961	In
100962	Damascus,
100963	
100964	the governor
100965	Aretas
100966	
100967	under King
100968	was guarding
100969	
100970	the city
100971	of Damascus
100972	in order to arrest me,
100973	
100974	
100975	through
100976	a window
100977	in
100978	a rope-basket
100979	but I was let down
100980	in
100981	
100982	the city wall,
100983	
100984	and escaped
100985	
100986	his hands.
100987	
100988	to go on boasting.
100989	It is necessary
100990	it is not
100991	profitable,
100992	Though
100993	I will go on
100994	
100995	to
100996	visions
100997	
100998	and revelations
100999	from the Lord.
101000	I know
101001	a man
101002	in
101003	Christ
101004	ago
101005	years
101006	who fourteen
101007	(whether
101008	in
101009	the body
101010	
101011	
101012	or
101013	out of
101014	
101015	the body
101016	I do not
101017	know,
101018	
101019	God
101020	knows)
101021	was caught up
101022	
101023	
101024	to
101025	the third
101026	heaven.
101027	
101028	And I know
101029	
101030	that this
101031	man
101032	(whether
101033	in
101034	the body
101035	or
101036	apart from
101037	
101038	the body
101039	I do not
101040	know,
101041	
101042	God
101043	knows)
101044	
101045	was caught up
101046	into
101047	
101048	paradise
101049	
101050	and heard
101051	things too sacred
101052	to be put into words,
101053	things that
101054	is not
101055	permitted
101056	a person
101057	to speak.
101058	On behalf of
101059	
101060	such an individual
101061	I will boast,
101062	behalf
101063	but
101064	on my own
101065	I will not
101066	boast,
101067	
101068	except
101069	about
101070	
101071	my weaknesses.
101072	even if
101073	For
101074	I wish
101075	to boast,
101076	I will not
101077	be
101078	a fool,
101079	the truth,
101080	for
101081	I would be telling
101082	I refrain
101083	but
101084	from this so that no
101085	one
101086	
101087	
101088	may regard me
101089	beyond
101090	what
101091	he sees in me
101092	
101093	or
101094	he hears
101095	what
101096	from me,
101097	
101098	
101099	
101100	even because of the extraordinary character
101101	
101102	of the revelations.
101103	Therefore,
101104	so that
101105	I would not
101106	become arrogant,
101107	was given to me,
101108	
101109	a thorn
101110	
101111	in the flesh
101112	a messenger
101113	of Satan
101114	to
101115	
101116	trouble me –
101117	so that
101118	I would not
101119	become arrogant.
101120	about this,
101121	
101122	three times
101123	
101124	the Lord
101125	I asked
101126	that
101127	it would depart
101128	from me.
101129	
101130	
101131	But he said to me,
101132	
101133	is enough for you,
101134	
101135	
101136	“My grace
101137	
101138	
101139	for
101140	my power
101141	in
101142	weakness.”
101143	is made perfect
101144	
101145	So then,
101146	most
101147	I will boast
101148	gladly about
101149	
101150	my weaknesses,
101151	
101152	so that
101153	may reside
101154	in me.
101155	
101156	
101157	the power
101158	
101159	of Christ
101160	Therefore
101161	I am content
101162	with
101163	weaknesses,
101164	with
101165	insults,
101166	with
101167	troubles,
101168	with
101169	persecutions
101170	
101171	and difficulties
101172	for the sake of
101173	Christ,
101174	whenever
101175	for
101176	I am weak,
101177	then
101178	strong.
101179	I am
101180	I have become
101181	a fool.
101182	
101183	
101184	You yourselves forced me
101185	
101186	to do it, for
101187	I should
101188	by you.
101189	
101190	have been commended
101191	nothing in comparison
101192	For
101193	I lack
101194	
101195	to those “super-
101196	apostles,”
101197	even though
101198	
101199	nothing.
101200	I am
101201	
101202	Indeed,
101203	the signs
101204	
101205	of an apostle
101206	were performed
101207	among you
101208	
101209	with
101210	great
101211	perseverance
101212	by signs
101213	
101214	
101215	and wonders
101216	
101217	and powerful deeds.
101218	how
101219	For
101220	were
101221	
101222	you treated worse
101223	than
101224	
101225	the other
101226	churches,
101227	
101228	except
101229	
101230	
101231	
101232	that I myself was not
101233	a burden
101234	
101235	to you? Forgive me
101236	
101237	
101238	this injustice!
101239	
101240	Look,
101241	for the third time
101242	
101243	ready
101244	I am
101245	to come
101246	to you,
101247	
101248	
101249	and I will not
101250	be a burden
101251	I do not
101252	to you, because
101253	want
101254	
101255	
101256	your possessions, but you.
101257	
101258	should not
101259	For
101260	have
101261	
101262	children
101263	
101264	for their parents,
101265	to save up
101266	but
101267	
101268	parents
101269	
101270	for their children.
101271	
101272	Now
101273	
101274	I will most gladly spend
101275	
101276	and be spent
101277	for
101278	
101279	your lives!
101280	
101281	If
101282	more,
101283	
101284	I love you
101285	less?
101286	am I to be loved
101287	be
101288	But
101289	
101290	that as it may, I have not
101291	burdened you.
101292	
101293	Yet
101294	because I was
101295	a crafty person,
101296	in by deceit!
101297	
101298	I took you
101299	I have not
101300	anyone
101301	
101302	I have sent
101303	to you, have I?
101304	
101305	through
101306	
101307	taken advantage of you
101308	
101309	I urged
101310	Titus
101311	
101312	to visit you and I sent
101313	
101314	our brother
101315	did not
101316	take advantage of you,
101317	
101318	along with him. Titus
101319	did he? Did we not
101320	
101321	
101322	ourselves in the same spirit?
101323	conduct
101324	Did we not
101325	
101326	
101327	behave in the same way?
101328	all this time
101329	Have you been thinking
101330	
101331	
101332	that we have been defending
101333	before
101334	God,
101335	in
101336	Christ
101337	ourselves to you? We are speaking
101338	
101339	and
101340	everything
101341	we do, dear friends,
101342	
101343	
101344	
101345	is to build you up.
101346	I am afraid
101347	For
101348	
101349	that somehow
101350	when I come
101351	I will not
101352	what
101353	I wish,
101354	find you
101355	
101356	and
101357	you will find
101358	
101359	what
101360	me not
101361	
101362	you wish.
101363	I am afraid that somehow
101364	there may be quarreling,
101365	jealousy,
101366	intense anger,
101367	selfish ambition,
101368	slander,
101369	gossip,
101370	arrogance,
101371	and disorder.
101372	I am afraid that
101373	again,
101374	when I come
101375	
101376	may humiliate me
101377	
101378	
101379	my God
101380	
101381	before you,
101382	
101383	
101384	and I will grieve
101385	for many
101386	
101387	of those who previously sinned
101388	
101389	and have not
101390	repented
101391	of
101392	
101393	the impurity,
101394	
101395	sexual immorality,
101396	
101397	and licentiousness
101398	that
101399	they have practiced.
101400	This is the third time
101401	
101402	I am coming
101403	to visit you.
101404	
101405	By
101406	the testimony
101407	of two
101408	witnesses
101409	or
101410	three
101411	will be established.
101412	every
101413	matter
101414	I said before
101415	
101416	I say again
101417	when
101418	I was present
101419	
101420	the second time
101421	
101422	though absent,
101423	and now,
101424	
101425	to those who sinned previously
101426	
101427	
101428	the rest,
101429	and to all
101430	
101431	that if
101432	I come
101433	
101434	
101435	again,
101436	I will not
101437	spare anyone,
101438	since
101439	proof
101440	you are demanding
101441	
101442	through me.
101443	
101444	is speaking
101445	that Christ
101446	He
101447	toward you
101448	
101449	is not
101450	weak
101451	but
101452	is powerful
101453	among you.
101454	
101455	
101456	For
101457	indeed he was crucified
101458	by reason of
101459	weakness,
101460	but
101461	he lives
101462	because of
101463	power.
101464	God’s
101465	
101466	For
101467	
101468	we also are weak
101469	in him,
101470	
101471	but
101472	we will live
101473	together with him,
101474	
101475	because of
101476	power
101477	God’s
101478	toward you.
101479	
101480	Put yourselves
101481	to the test
101482	to see if
101483	you are
101484	in
101485	
101486	the faith;
101487	yourselves!
101488	examine
101489	Or
101490	do you not
101491	recognize
101492	regarding yourselves
101493	
101494	that Jesus
101495	Christ
101496	is in
101497	you –
101498	unless,
101499	indeed,
101500	fail the test!
101501	you
101502	I hope
101503	And
101504	
101505	that you will realize
101506	
101507	
101508	not
101509	that we have
101510	failed the test!
101511	we pray
101512	Now
101513	to
101514	
101515	God
101516	may not
101517	do
101518	that you
101519	wrong,
101520	anything
101521	not
101522	so that
101523	
101524	to have passed the test,
101525	we may appear
101526	but
101527	so that
101528	
101529	
101530	what is right
101531	you may do
101532	
101533	even
101534	
101535	to have failed the test.
101536	if we may appear
101537	
101538	For
101539	we cannot
101540	do anything
101541	against
101542	
101543	the truth,
101544	but
101545	only for the sake of
101546	
101547	the truth.
101548	we rejoice
101549	For
101550	whenever
101551	
101552	we are weak,
101553	
101554	but
101555	strong.
101556	you are
101557	
101558	
101559	And we pray for this:
101560	
101561	
101562	that you may become fully qualified.
101563	Because of
101564	
101565	
101566	these things while absent,
101567	this I am writing
101568	so that
101569	when I arrive
101570	I may not
101571	harshly
101572	have to deal
101573	with you by
101574	
101575	using my authority –
101576	
101577	
101578	the Lord
101579	gave it to me
101580	
101581	for
101582	building up,
101583	
101584	not
101585	for
101586	tearing down!
101587	Finally,
101588	brothers
101589	and sisters, rejoice,
101590	set things right,
101591	be encouraged,
101592	
101593	
101594	agree
101595	with one another, live in peace,
101596	
101597	
101598	and the God
101599	
101600	of love
101601	
101602	and peace
101603	will be
101604	with you.
101605	
101606	Greet
101607	one another
101608	with
101609	a holy
101610	kiss.
101611	greet you.
101612	
101613	
101614	the saints
101615	All
101616	
101617	The grace
101618	
101619	of the Lord
101620	Jesus
101621	Christ
101622	
101623	
101624	and the love
101625	
101626	of God
101627	
101628	
101629	and the fellowship
101630	
101631	of the Holy
101632	
101633	Spirit be with you
101634	all.
101635	
101636	From Paul,
101637	an apostle
101638	(not
101639	from
101640	men,
101641	nor
101642	by
101643	human agency,
101644	but
101645	by
101646	Jesus
101647	Christ
101648	
101649	and God
101650	the Father
101651	
101652	who raised him
101653	
101654	from
101655	the dead)
101656	
101657	
101658	with me,
101659	
101660	and all
101661	the brothers
101662	
101663	to the churches
101664	
101665	of Galatia.
101666	Grace
101667	
101668	
101669	and peace to you
101670	from
101671	God
101672	the Father
101673	
101674	
101675	and our Lord
101676	Jesus
101677	Christ,
101678	
101679	who gave
101680	himself
101681	for
101682	
101683	our sins
101684	
101685	to
101686	rescue us
101687	
101688	from
101689	
101690	age
101691	
101692	this present
101693	evil
101694	according to
101695	
101696	the will
101697	
101698	of our God
101699	
101700	and Father,
101701	
101702	to whom
101703	
101704	be glory
101705	
101706	
101707	forever
101708	
101709	and ever!
101710	Amen.
101711	I am astonished
101712	
101713	that you are so
101714	quickly
101715	deserting
101716	
101717	
101718	the one who called you
101719	
101720	by
101721	the grace
101722	of Christ
101723	
101724	and are following a different
101725	gospel –
101726	that
101727	not
101728	there really is
101729	another gospel,
101730	
101731	but
101732	some
101733	there are
101734	who are
101735	disturbing
101736	
101737	
101738	you and wanting
101739	to distort
101740	
101741	the gospel
101742	
101743	of Christ.
101744	But
101745	
101746	even if
101747	
101748	we (or
101749	an angel
101750	from
101751	heaven)
101752	should preach a gospel
101753	
101754	contrary
101755	to the one
101756	we preached to you,
101757	
101758	condemned to hell!
101759	let him be
101760	As
101761	we have said before,
101762	
101763	and now
101764	again,
101765	I say
101766	if
101767	any one
101768	
101769	is preaching to you
101770	a gospel contrary
101771	to what
101772	you received,
101773	condemned to hell!
101774	let him be
101775	Am I now
101776	
101777	of people,
101778	trying to gain the approval
101779	or
101780	
101781	of God?
101782	Or
101783	am I trying
101784	people?
101785	to please
101786	If
101787	I were still
101788	people,
101789	trying to please
101790	of Christ!
101791	a slave
101792	I would not
101793	
101794	be
101795	I want you to know,
101796	Now
101797	
101798	brothers and sisters,
101799	
101800	that the gospel
101801	
101802	I preached
101803	
101804	
101805	
101806	not
101807	is
101808	of
101809	human origin.
101810	I did not
101811	For
101812	
101813	it from
101814	any human source;
101815	receive it
101816	
101817	or
101818	learn
101819	instead
101820	I received it by
101821	a revelation
101822	of Jesus
101823	Christ.
101824	you have heard
101825	For
101826	
101827	of my
101828	way of life
101829	former
101830	in
101831	
101832	Judaism,
101833	
101834	
101835	savagely
101836	how I was
101837	
101838	persecuting the church
101839	
101840	of God
101841	
101842	and trying to destroy it.
101843	
101844	
101845	I was advancing
101846	in
101847	
101848	Judaism
101849	beyond
101850	many
101851	of my contemporaries
101852	in
101853	
101854	my nation,
101855	
101856	extremely
101857	zealous
101858	and was
101859	
101860	of my ancestors.
101861	
101862	for the traditions
101863	when
101864	But
101865	was pleased
101866	
101867	
101868	
101869	the one who set me
101870	
101871	apart from
101872	birth
101873	
101874	
101875	
101876	and called me
101877	by
101878	
101879	his grace
101880	
101881	to reveal
101882	
101883	his Son
101884	
101885	in me
101886	
101887	so that
101888	I could preach him
101889	
101890	among
101891	
101892	the Gentiles,
101893	
101894	I did not
101895	go to ask advice
101896	
101897	
101898	from any human being,
101899	nor
101900	did I go up
101901	to
101902	Jerusalem
101903	to
101904	
101905	before me,
101906	
101907	see those who were apostles
101908	but
101909	right away I departed
101910	to
101911	Arabia,
101912	
101913	and then
101914	returned
101915	to
101916	Damascus.
101917	Then
101918	after
101919	years
101920	three
101921	I went up
101922	to
101923	Jerusalem
101924	to visit
101925	Cephas
101926	
101927	and get information from him, and I stayed
101928	with him
101929	
101930	days.
101931	fifteen
101932	of the other
101933	But
101934	
101935	apostles
101936	none
101937	I saw
101938	
101939	except
101940	James
101941	
101942	brother.
101943	
101944	the Lord’s
101945	lying about what
101946	
101947	I am writing to you!
101948	
101949	
101950	you that, before
101951	
101952	God,
101953	
101954	I am not
101955	I assure
101956	Afterward
101957	I went
101958	to
101959	
101960	the regions
101961	
101962	of Syria
101963	
101964	
101965	and Cilicia.
101966	I was
101967	But
101968	unknown
101969	
101970	personally
101971	
101972	to the churches
101973	
101974	of Judea
101975	
101976	that are in
101977	Christ.
101978	only
101979	
101980	hearing,
101981	They were
101982	
101983	
101984	persecuted us
101985	
101986	“The one who once
101987	is now
101988	proclaiming the good news
101989	
101990	of the faith
101991	
101992	he once
101993	tried to destroy.”
101994	
101995	So they glorified
101996	because of me.
101997	
101998	
101999	God
102000	Then
102001	after
102002	fourteen
102003	years
102004	again
102005	I went up
102006	to
102007	Jerusalem
102008	with
102009	Barnabas,
102010	taking
102011	
102012	Titus along too.
102013	I went
102014	
102015	there because of
102016	a revelation
102017	
102018	and presented to them
102019	
102020	
102021	the gospel
102022	that
102023	I preach
102024	among
102025	
102026	the Gentiles.
102027	I did so only in
102028	a private meeting with
102029	But
102030	
102031	the influential people,
102032	to make sure that I was not
102033	
102034	in
102035	vain.
102036	running –
102037	or had not
102038	run –
102039	Yet
102040	not even
102041	Titus,
102042	
102043	who was with me,
102044	
102045	although he was a Greek.
102046	was
102047	compelled
102048	to be circumcised,
102049	because of
102050	Now
102051	
102052	this matter arose
102053	the false brothers
102054	with false pretenses who
102055	slipped in unnoticed
102056	to spy on
102057	
102058	our freedom
102059	
102060	that
102061	we have
102062	in
102063	Christ
102064	Jesus,
102065	to
102066	
102067	make us slaves.
102068	to them
102069	But we did not
102070	even for
102071	a moment,
102072	surrender
102073	
102074	
102075	in order that
102076	
102077	the truth
102078	
102079	of the gospel
102080	would remain
102081	with you.
102082	
102083	from
102084	But
102085	
102086	influential
102087	those who were
102088	
102089	(whatever
102090	
102091	they were
102092	makes no
102093	to me;
102094	difference
102095	
102096	
102097	God
102098	between people) –
102099	shows no
102100	favoritism
102101	to my message.
102102	
102103	
102104	those influential leaders
102105	nothing
102106	added
102107	
102108	On the contrary,
102109	when they saw
102110	
102111	that I was entrusted
102112	
102113	with the gospel
102114	
102115	to the uncircumcised
102116	just as
102117	Peter
102118	
102119	was entrusted with the gospel to the circumcised
102120	
102121	(for
102122	he who empowered
102123	Peter
102124	for
102125	his apostleship
102126	
102127	to the circumcised
102128	also empowered me
102129	
102130	
102131	for
102132	
102133	my apostleship to the Gentiles)
102134	
102135	recognized
102136	
102137	the grace
102138	
102139	that had been given to me,
102140	
102141	and when James,
102142	
102143	Cephas,
102144	
102145	and John,
102146	
102147	who had a reputation
102148	pillars,
102149	as
102150	and me the right hand
102151	they gave
102152	
102153	
102154	to Barnabas
102155	of fellowship,
102156	agreeing that
102157	
102158	we would go to
102159	
102160	the Gentiles
102161	
102162	and
102163	they to
102164	
102165	the circumcised.
102166	They requested only
102167	
102168	the poor,
102169	that
102170	we remember
102171	
102172	
102173	the very thing I also was eager
102174	
102175	
102176	to do.
102177	when
102178	But
102179	came
102180	Cephas
102181	to
102182	Antioch,
102183	him to
102184	his face,
102185	
102186	I opposed
102187	
102188	clearly done wrong.
102189	because he had
102190	Until
102191	
102192	
102193	came
102194	certain people
102195	from
102196	James,
102197	with
102198	
102199	the Gentiles.
102200	he had been eating
102201	when
102202	But
102203	they arrived,
102204	he stopped doing
102205	
102206	this and separated
102207	himself
102208	because he was afraid
102209	
102210	
102211	of those who were pro-circumcision.
102212	
102213	also joined with him
102214	
102215	
102216	
102217	And the rest
102218	of the Jews
102219	in this hypocrisy, so that
102220	
102221	even Barnabas
102222	was led astray with them
102223	
102224	
102225	by their hypocrisy.
102226	But
102227	when
102228	I saw
102229	
102230	that they were not
102231	behaving consistently
102232	with
102233	
102234	the truth
102235	
102236	of the gospel,
102237	I said
102238	
102239	to Cephas
102240	in front of
102241	them all,
102242	“If you,
102243	
102244	although you are a Jew,
102245	live
102246	like a Gentile
102247	
102248	and not
102249	like a Jew,
102250	
102251	how
102252	
102253	the Gentiles
102254	can you try to force
102255	to live like Jews?”
102256	
102257	by birth
102258	We are Jews
102259	
102260	and not
102261	
102262	Gentile
102263	sinners,
102264	we know
102265	yet
102266	that
102267	no
102268	is justified
102269	one
102270	by
102271	the works
102272	of the law
102273	
102274	but
102275	by
102276	the faithfulness
102277	of Jesus
102278	Christ.
102279	
102280	
102281	in
102282	Christ
102283	Jesus,
102284	And we have come to believe
102285	so that
102286	we may be justified
102287	by
102288	the faithfulness
102289	of Christ
102290	
102291	and not
102292	by
102293	the works
102294	of the law,
102295	
102296	because by
102297	the works
102298	of the law
102299	no
102300	will be justified.
102301	
102302	one
102303	if
102304	But
102305	while seeking
102306	to be justified
102307	in
102308	Christ
102309	we ourselves have also been found
102310	
102311	
102312	to be sinners,
102313	then
102314	is Christ
102315	sin?
102316	one who encourages
102317	not!
102318	Absolutely
102319	if
102320	But
102321	those things
102322	I once destroyed,
102323	
102324	again
102325	I build up
102326	who breaks God’s law.
102327	that I am one
102328	I demonstrate
102329	
102330	For
102331	through
102332	the law
102333	to the law
102334	I died
102335	so that
102336	to God.
102337	I may live
102338	with Christ,
102339	I have been crucified
102340	I who live,
102341	and
102342	it is no longer
102343	
102344	lives
102345	but
102346	in me.
102347	
102348	Christ
102349	the life
102350	So
102351	I now
102352	live
102353	in
102354	the body,
102355	because of
102356	the faithfulness
102357	I live
102358	
102359	of the
102360	Son
102361	
102362	of God,
102363	who
102364	loved me
102365	
102366	
102367	and gave
102368	himself
102369	for me.
102370	
102371	I do not
102372	set aside
102373	
102374	grace,
102375	
102376	God’s
102377	if
102378	because
102379	could come through
102380	the law,
102381	righteousness
102382	then
102383	Christ
102384	for nothing!
102385	died
102386	
102387	You foolish
102388	Galatians!
102389	Who
102390	
102391	has cast a spell on you?
102392	
102393	Before
102394	your eyes
102395	Jesus
102396	Christ
102397	was vividly portrayed
102398	as crucified!
102399	
102400	The only
102401	thing I want
102402	to learn
102403	from
102404	
102405	by
102406	doing the works
102407	of the law
102408	
102409	the Spirit
102410	you is this: Did you receive
102411	or
102412	by
102413	what you heard?
102414	believing
102415	you so
102416	foolish?
102417	Are
102418	Although you began
102419	with the Spirit,
102420	are you now
102421	by human effort?
102422	trying to finish
102423	so many things
102424	Have you suffered
102425	for nothing? –
102426	if
102427	
102428	indeed
102429	it was for nothing.
102430	
102431	God then
102432	Does
102433	
102434	
102435	give you the Spirit
102436	
102437	and work
102438	miracles
102439	among you
102440	
102441	by
102442	your doing the works
102443	of the law
102444	or
102445	by
102446	what you heard?
102447	your believing
102448	Just as
102449	Abraham
102450	believed
102451	
102452	God,
102453	
102454	and it was credited to him
102455	
102456	as
102457	righteousness,
102458	understand
102459	so then,
102460	
102461	
102462	
102463	that those who believe
102464	
102465	the sons
102466	are
102467	of Abraham.
102468	foreseeing
102469	And
102470	
102471	the scripture,
102472	
102473	by
102474	faith,
102475	would justify
102476	
102477	the Gentiles
102478	
102479	that God
102480	proclaimed the gospel
102481	
102482	to Abraham
102483	
102484	will be blessed
102485	in you.”
102486	
102487	ahead of time, saying, “All
102488	
102489	the nations
102490	So then
102491	
102492	
102493	those who believe
102494	are blessed
102495	along with
102496	
102497	the believer.
102498	Abraham
102499	all
102500	For
102501	
102502	doing the works
102503	of the law
102504	who rely on
102505	under
102506	a curse,
102507	are
102508	it is written,
102509	because
102510	
102511	“Cursed
102512	is everyone
102513	who
102514	does not
102515	keep on doing
102516	everything
102517	
102518	written
102519	in
102520	
102521	the book
102522	
102523	of the law.”
102524	
102525	
102526	
102527	
102528	Now
102529	by
102530	the law,
102531	no one
102532	is justified
102533	before
102534	
102535	God
102536	it is clear
102537	
102538	
102539	because the righteous
102540	by
102541	faith.
102542	one will live
102543	
102544	But
102545	the law
102546	not
102547	is
102548	based on
102549	faith,
102550	but
102551	
102552	the one who does
102553	
102554	the works of the law will live
102555	by them.
102556	
102557	Christ
102558	
102559	redeemed us
102560	from
102561	
102562	the curse
102563	
102564	of the law
102565	by becoming
102566	for us
102567	
102568	a curse
102569	
102570	(because it is written,
102571	“Cursed
102572	is everyone
102573	
102574	who hangs
102575	on
102576	a tree”)
102577	in order that
102578	to
102579	
102580	the Gentiles,
102581	
102582	the blessing
102583	
102584	of Abraham
102585	would come
102586	in
102587	Christ
102588	Jesus
102589	so that
102590	
102591	the promise
102592	
102593	of the Spirit
102594	we could receive
102595	by
102596	
102597	faith.
102598	Brothers and sisters,
102599	
102600	an example from everyday life:
102601	I offer
102602	even though
102603	it is only a human
102604	has been ratified,
102605	When a covenant
102606	contract, no one
102607	can set
102608	it aside or
102609	add anything to it.
102610	
102611	Now
102612	to Abraham
102613	say,
102614	
102615	the promises
102616	
102617	
102618	and to his descendant.
102619	
102620	Scripture does not
102621	were spoken
102622	
102623	
102624	“and to the descendants,”
102625	referring
102626	to
102627	many,
102628	but
102629	referring
102630	to
102631	one,
102632	
102633	
102634	“and to your descendant,”
102635	
102636	who
102637	is
102638	Christ.
102639	
102640	
102641	What I am saying is this:
102642	a covenant
102643	previously ratified
102644	by
102645	
102646	God,
102647	
102648	later
102649	four hundred
102650	
102651	thirty
102652	years
102653	that came
102654	The law
102655	does not
102656	cancel
102657	so as
102658	
102659	to invalidate
102660	
102661	the promise.
102662	if
102663	For
102664	is based on
102665	the law,
102666	
102667	the inheritance
102668	it is no longer
102669	based on
102670	the promise,
102671	
102672	but
102673	it to Abraham
102674	through
102675	the promise.
102676	graciously gave
102677	
102678	God
102679	Why
102680	then
102681	
102682	was the law
102683	
102684	transgressions,
102685	because of
102686	given? It was added
102687	until
102688	to whom
102689	the arrival
102690	
102691	of the descendant
102692	
102693	the promise
102694	had been made. It was administered
102695	through
102696	angels
102697	by
102698	
102699	an intermediary.
102700	
102701	Now
102702	an intermediary
102703	for one
102704	not
102705	is
102706	
102707	party alone, but
102708	God
102709	one.
102710	is
102711	
102712	therefore
102713	Is the law
102714	opposed
102715	
102716	to the promises
102717	
102718	of God?
102719	not!
102720	Absolutely
102721	if
102722	For
102723	had been given
102724	a law
102725	
102726	that was able
102727	to give life,
102728	would certainly
102729	by
102730	the law.
102731	
102732	have come
102733	
102734	then righteousness
102735	But
102736	imprisoned
102737	
102738	the scripture
102739	
102740	everything
102741	under
102742	sin
102743	so that
102744	
102745	the promise
102746	because of
102747	the faithfulness
102748	of Jesus
102749	Christ –
102750	could be given –
102751	
102752	to those who believe.
102753	before
102754	
102755	Now
102756	came
102757	
102758	faith
102759	under
102760	the law,
102761	we were held in custody
102762	being kept as prisoners
102763	until
102764	
102765	the coming
102766	faith
102767	would be revealed.
102768	Thus
102769	
102770	the law
102771	our guardian
102772	
102773	had become
102774	until
102775	Christ,
102776	so that
102777	by
102778	faith.
102779	we could be declared righteous
102780	has come,
102781	But
102782	
102783	now that faith
102784	no longer
102785	under
102786	a guardian.
102787	we are
102788	all
102789	For
102790	sons
102791	of God
102792	you are
102793	through
102794	
102795	faith.
102796	in
102797	Christ
102798	Jesus
102799	all
102800	For
102801	into
102802	Christ
102803	of you who were baptized
102804	yourselves with Christ.
102805	have clothed
102806	neither
102807	There is
102808	Jew
102809	nor
102810	Greek,
102811	neither
102812	there is
102813	slave
102814	nor
102815	free,
102816	neither
102817	there is
102818	male
102819	
102820	nor female –
102821	all
102822	for
102823	
102824	one
102825	of you are
102826	in
102827	Christ
102828	Jesus.
102829	if you
102830	And
102831	
102832	belong to Christ,
102833	then
102834	
102835	Abraham’s
102836	descendants,
102837	you are
102838	according to
102839	the promise.
102840	heirs
102841	I mean
102842	Now
102843	
102844	
102845	as long as
102846	
102847	that the heir,
102848	a minor,
102849	he is
102850	no
102851	different
102852	from a slave,
102853	though he is the owner
102854	of everything.
102855	is
102856	But
102857	under
102858	guardians
102859	he is
102860	
102861	and managers
102862	until
102863	
102864	the date set
102865	
102866	by his father.
102867	So
102868	
102869	
102870	also we, when
102871	we were
102872	minors,
102873	under
102874	
102875	the basic forces
102876	
102877	of the world.
102878	were
102879	enslaved
102880	when
102881	But
102882	had come,
102883	
102884	the appropriate
102885	
102886	time
102887	sent out
102888	
102889	God
102890	
102891	his Son,
102892	
102893	born
102894	of
102895	a woman,
102896	born
102897	under
102898	the law,
102899	to
102900	
102901	those who were under
102902	the law,
102903	redeem
102904	so that
102905	
102906	adopted as sons with full rights.
102907	we may be
102908	
102909	And
102910	because you are
102911	sons,
102912	sent
102913	
102914	God
102915	
102916	the Spirit
102917	
102918	of his Son
102919	
102920	into
102921	
102922	our hearts,
102923	
102924	who calls
102925	“Abba!
102926	
102927	Father!”
102928	So
102929	no longer
102930	you are
102931	a slave
102932	but
102933	a son,
102934	if
102935	and
102936	you are a son,
102937	
102938	then you are also an heir
102939	through
102940	God.
102941	
102942	Formerly
102943	
102944	when you did not
102945	know
102946	God,
102947	you were enslaved
102948	
102949	to beings that by nature
102950	not
102951	are
102952	gods at all.
102953	now
102954	But
102955	that you have come to know
102956	God
102957	rather
102958	(or
102959	to be known
102960	by
102961	God),
102962	how
102963	can you turn back
102964	again
102965	to
102966	
102967	the weak
102968	
102969	and worthless
102970	basic forces?
102971	to them
102972	again?
102973	all over
102974	to be enslaved
102975	Do you want
102976	days
102977	You are observing religious
102978	
102979	and months
102980	
102981	and seasons
102982	
102983	and years.
102984	I fear
102985	
102986	
102987	
102988	may have been in vain.
102989	for you that my work
102990	for you
102991	
102992	become
102993	like me,
102994	
102995	
102996	because I
102997	have become like you.
102998	
102999	brothers and sisters,
103000	I beg you,
103001	
103002	no wrong!
103003	
103004	You have done me
103005	you know
103006	But
103007	
103008	it was because of
103009	illness
103010	
103011	a physical
103012	proclaimed the gospel to you,
103013	
103014	
103015	that I first
103016	
103017	
103018	to the test,
103019	
103020	
103021	
103022	and though my physical condition put you
103023	
103024	you did not
103025	despise
103026	or
103027	reject
103028	me. Instead,
103029	as though
103030	I were an angel
103031	of God,
103032	you welcomed me
103033	
103034	as though
103035	I were Christ
103036	Jesus himself!
103037	Where
103038	then
103039	
103040	is your sense of happiness
103041	
103042	I testify about you
103043	now? For
103044	
103045	
103046	that if
103047	it were possible,
103048	
103049	your eyes
103050	
103051	you would have pulled out
103052	and given them to me!
103053	
103054	So then,
103055	your enemy
103056	
103057	have I become
103058	by telling you the truth?
103059	
103060	They court
103061	you eagerly,
103062	for no
103063	good purpose;
103064	but
103065	to exclude you,
103066	
103067	they want
103068	so that
103069	them eagerly.
103070	you would seek
103071	it is good
103072	However,
103073	to be sought eagerly
103074	for
103075	a good
103076	purpose at all times,
103077	
103078	and not
103079	only
103080	when
103081	
103082	I am present
103083	
103084	with you.
103085	
103086	My children –
103087	
103088	
103089	I am again
103090	undergoing birth pains
103091	until
103092	
103093	is formed
103094	Christ
103095	in you!
103096	
103097	I wish
103098	
103099	I could be
103100	with you
103101	
103102	now
103103	
103104	and change
103105	
103106	my tone of voice,
103107	
103108	
103109	because I am perplexed
103110	about you.
103111	
103112	Tell me,
103113	
103114	
103115	under
103116	the law,
103117	you who want
103118	to be
103119	
103120	the law?
103121	do you not
103122	understand
103123	it is written
103124	For
103125	
103126	that Abraham
103127	two
103128	sons,
103129	had
103130	one
103131	by
103132	
103133	the slave woman
103134	
103135	and the other
103136	by
103137	
103138	the free woman.
103139	But
103140	
103141	
103142	one, the son by
103143	
103144	the slave woman,
103145	by
103146	natural descent,
103147	was born
103148	
103149	while
103150	the other, the son by
103151	
103152	the free woman,
103153	was born through
103154	the promise.
103155	These things
103156	may be
103157	treated as an allegory,
103158	
103159	for
103160	these women represent
103161	two
103162	covenants.
103163	One
103164	
103165	is from
103166	Mount
103167	Sinai
103168	for
103169	slavery;
103170	bearing children
103171	this
103172	is
103173	Hagar.
103174	
103175	Now
103176	Hagar
103177	Sinai
103178	Mount
103179	represents
103180	in
103181	
103182	Arabia
103183	corresponds
103184	and
103185	
103186	to the present
103187	Jerusalem,
103188	she is in slavery
103189	for
103190	with
103191	
103192	her children.
103193	
103194	
103195	But
103196	above
103197	the Jerusalem
103198	free,
103199	is
103200	and she
103201	is
103202	our mother.
103203	
103204	it is written:
103205	For
103206	“Rejoice,
103207	O barren woman
103208	who
103209	does not
103210	bear children;
103211	break forth
103212	
103213	and shout,
103214	you who have
103215	no
103216	birth pains,
103217	
103218	
103219	
103220	because the children
103221	
103222	of the desolate
103223	woman are more
103224	numerous than
103225	
103226	those of the woman who has
103227	
103228	a husband.”
103229	
103230	But
103231	you, brothers and sisters,
103232	like
103233	Isaac.
103234	of the promise
103235	children
103236	are
103237	But
103238	just as
103239	at that time
103240	
103241	by
103242	natural descent
103243	the one born
103244	persecuted
103245	
103246	the one born according to
103247	the Spirit,
103248	so
103249	
103250	it is now.
103251	But
103252	what
103253	say?
103254	
103255	does the scripture
103256	“Throw out
103257	
103258	the slave woman
103259	
103260	
103261	and her son,
103262	
103263	
103264	for
103265	will not
103266	share the inheritance
103267	
103268	the son
103269	
103270	of the slave woman
103271	with
103272	
103273	the son”
103274	
103275	of the free woman.
103276	Therefore,
103277	brothers and sisters,
103278	not
103279	we are
103280	of the slave woman
103281	children
103282	but
103283	
103284	of the free woman.
103285	
103286	For freedom
103287	
103288	Christ
103289	has set us
103290	free. Stand firm,
103291	then,
103292	
103293	and do not
103294	again
103295	to the yoke
103296	of slavery.
103297	be subject
103298	Listen!
103299	
103300	I, Paul,
103301	tell you
103302	
103303	
103304	that if
103305	you let yourselves be circumcised,
103306	Christ
103307	
103308	of no benefit to you at all!
103309	will be
103310	I testify
103311	And
103312	again
103313	to every
103314	man
103315	who lets himself be circumcised
103316	
103317	obligated
103318	that he is
103319	the whole
103320	
103321	law.
103322	to obey
103323	have been alienated
103324	from
103325	Christ;
103326	You who
103327	by
103328	the law
103329	are trying to be declared righteous
103330	
103331	from grace!
103332	you have fallen away
103333	
103334	For
103335	through the Spirit,
103336	by
103337	faith,
103338	the hope
103339	of righteousness.
103340	we wait expectantly for
103341	in
103342	For
103343	Christ
103344	Jesus
103345	neither
103346	circumcision
103347	any weight –
103348	carries
103349	nor
103350	uncircumcision
103351	the only thing that matters is
103352	faith
103353	through
103354	love.
103355	working
103356	You were running
103357	well;
103358	who
103359	
103360	prevented
103361	
103362	
103363	the truth?
103364	you from obeying
103365	
103366	This persuasion
103367	does not
103368	come from
103369	
103370	the one who calls you!
103371	
103372	A little
103373	yeast
103374	makes the whole
103375	
103376	batch of dough
103377	rise!
103378	
103379	I am confident
103380	
103381	
103382	in
103383	the Lord
103384	
103385	no
103386	other
103387	that you will accept
103388	
103389	view. But
103390	the one who is confusing
103391	
103392	you will pay
103393	
103394	the penalty,
103395	whoever
103396	
103397	he may be.
103398	
103399	Now,
103400	brothers and sisters,
103401	if
103402	circumcision,
103403	I am still
103404	preaching
103405	why
103406	am I still
103407	being persecuted?
103408	In that case
103409	has been removed.
103410	
103411	the offense
103412	
103413	of the cross
103414	I wish
103415	
103416	to castrate themselves!
103417	those agitators would go so far as
103418	
103419	
103420	
103421	For
103422	to
103423	freedom,
103424	you were called
103425	brothers and sisters;
103426	only
103427	do not
103428	
103429	use your freedom
103430	as
103431	an opportunity
103432	
103433	to indulge your flesh,
103434	but
103435	through
103436	
103437	love
103438	serve
103439	one another.
103440	
103441	For
103442	the whole
103443	law
103444	in
103445	a single
103446	commandment,
103447	can be summed up
103448	
103449	
103450	namely, “You must love
103451	
103452	your neighbor
103453	
103454	as
103455	yourself.”
103456	if
103457	However,
103458	one another,
103459	you continually bite
103460	
103461	and devour
103462	beware
103463	that you are not
103464	by
103465	one another.
103466	consumed
103467	I say,
103468	But
103469	by the Spirit
103470	live
103471	
103472	the desires
103473	of the flesh.
103474	
103475	and you will not
103476	carry out
103477	
103478	For
103479	the flesh
103480	has desires
103481	that are opposed
103482	
103483	to the Spirit,
103484	
103485	and
103486	the Spirit
103487	has desires that are opposed
103488	
103489	to the flesh,
103490	
103491	for
103492	to each other,
103493	these are in opposition
103494	so that
103495	you cannot
103496	what
103497	
103498	you want.
103499	
103500	do
103501	if
103502	But
103503	by the Spirit,
103504	led
103505	you are not
103506	you are
103507	under
103508	the law.
103509	are obvious:
103510	Now
103511	
103512	
103513	the works
103514	
103515	of the flesh
103516	
103517	
103518	sexual immorality,
103519	impurity,
103520	depravity,
103521	idolatry,
103522	sorcery,
103523	hostilities,
103524	strife,
103525	jealousy,
103526	outbursts of anger,
103527	selfish rivalries,
103528	dissensions,
103529	factions,
103530	envying, murder,
103531	drunkenness,
103532	carousing,
103533	
103534	
103535	and similar
103536	things.
103537	
103538	I am warning you,
103539	
103540	as
103541	I had warned you before:
103542	
103543	
103544	
103545	such things
103546	Those who practice
103547	the kingdom
103548	of God!
103549	will not
103550	inherit
103551	
103552	But
103553	the fruit
103554	
103555	of the Spirit
103556	is
103557	love,
103558	joy,
103559	peace,
103560	patience,
103561	kindness,
103562	goodness,
103563	faithfulness,
103564	gentleness,
103565	and self-control.
103566	Against
103567	
103568	such things
103569	no
103570	there is
103571	law.
103572	
103573	Now
103574	
103575	those who belong to Christ
103576	
103577	
103578	the flesh
103579	have crucified
103580	with
103581	
103582	its passions
103583	
103584	
103585	and desires.
103586	If
103587	we live
103588	by the Spirit,
103589	the Spirit.
103590	
103591	let us also behave in accordance with
103592	Let us not
103593	become
103594	conceited,
103595	one another,
103596	provoking
103597	of one another.
103598	being jealous
103599	Brothers and sisters,
103600	if
103601	
103602	is discovered
103603	a person
103604	in
103605	some
103606	sin, you
103607	
103608	
103609	who are spiritual
103610	restore
103611	
103612	such a person
103613	in
103614	a spirit
103615	of gentleness.
103616	Pay close attention
103617	to yourselves, so that you
103618	are not
103619	
103620	
103621	tempted too.
103622	one another’s
103623	
103624	burdens,
103625	Carry
103626	
103627	and in this way
103628	you will fulfill
103629	
103630	the law
103631	
103632	of Christ.
103633	if
103634	For
103635	thinks
103636	anyone
103637	he is
103638	something
103639	nothing,
103640	when he is
103641	he deceives
103642	himself.
103643	
103644	
103645	work.
103646	his own
103647	examine
103648	Let each one
103649	
103650	Then
103651	in
103652	himself
103653	
103654	
103655	pride
103656	he can take
103657	
103658	and not
103659	compare himself with

103661	someone else.
103662	each one
103663	For
103664	
103665	his own
103666	load.
103667	will carry
103668	must share
103669	Now
103670	
103671	the one who receives instruction
103672	
103673	in the word
103674	
103675	things with the one who teaches it.
103676	
103677	all
103678	good
103679	Do not
103680	be deceived.
103681	God
103682	will not
103683	be made a fool.
103684	what
103685	For
103686	
103687	he sows,
103688	a person
103689	
103690	
103691	will reap
103692	
103693	
103694	because the person who sows
103695	to
103696	
103697	flesh
103698	his own
103699	from
103700	
103701	the flesh,
103702	will reap
103703	corruption
103704	
103705	but
103706	the one who sows
103707	to
103708	
103709	the Spirit
103710	from
103711	
103712	the Spirit.
103713	will reap
103714	life
103715	eternal
103716	
103717	So
103718	good,
103719	in doing
103720	we must not
103721	grow weary
103722	in due time
103723	for
103724	
103725	we will reap,
103726	if we do not
103727	give up.
103728	then,
103729	So
103730	whenever
103731	an opportunity,
103732	we have
103733	let us do
103734	
103735	good
103736	to
103737	all
103738	especially
103739	people, and
103740	to
103741	
103742	those who belong to the family
103743	
103744	of faith.
103745	See
103746	what big
103747	
103748	letters
103749	I make as I write to you
103750	
103751	with my own
103752	hand!
103753	Those who
103754	want
103755	to make a good showing
103756	in
103757	external matters
103758	
103759	are trying to force
103760	
103761	you to be circumcised.
103762	only
103763	They do so
103764	
103765	for the cross
103766	
103767	of Christ.
103768	to avoid
103769	being persecuted
103770	do not
103771	For
103772	
103773	those who are circumcised
103774	
103775	the law themselves,
103776	obey
103777	but
103778	they want
103779	
103780	you to be circumcised
103781	so that
103782	about
103783	
103784	your
103785	flesh.
103786	they can boast
103787	
103788	But
103789	may I never
103790	
103791	boast
103792	
103793	except
103794	in

103798	of our Lord
103799	
103800	Jesus
103801	Christ,
103802	through
103803	which
103804	
103805	the world
103806	has been crucified to me,
103807	and I
103808	to the world.
103809	neither
103810	For
103811	circumcision
103812	anything;
103813	counts for
103814	nor
103815	uncircumcision
103816	the only thing that matters is
103817	a new
103818	creation!
103819	
103820	And all
103821	
103822	with this rule,
103823	
103824	who will behave in accordance
103825	peace
103826	be on them,

103881	in
103882	Christ
103883	Jesus.
103884	Grace
103885	
103886	
103887	and peace to you
103888	from
103889	God
103890	our Father
103891	
103892	
103893	and the Lord
103894	Jesus
103895	Christ!
103896	Blessed
103897	
103898	is the God
103899	
103900	and Father
103901	
103902	of our Lord
103903	
103904	Jesus
103905	Christ,
103906	
103907	who has blessed us
103908	
103909	with
103910	every
103911	blessing
103912	spiritual
103913	in
103914	
103915	the heavenly realms
103916	in
103917	Christ.
103918	For
103919	he chose us
103920	
103921	in
103922	
103923	Christ before
103924	the foundation
103925	of the world
103926	that we should be
103927	
103928	holy
103929	
103930	and blameless
103931	before him
103932	
103933	in
103934	love.
103935	He did this by predestining us
103936	
103937	to
103938	adoption as
103939	his legal heirs through
103940	Jesus
103941	Christ,
103942	
103943	
103944	according to
103945	
103946	the pleasure
103947	
103948	of his will –
103949	
103950	to
103951	the praise
103952	of the glory
103953	
103954	of his grace
103955	
103956	that
103957	he has freely bestowed on us
103958	
103959	in
103960	
103961	his dearly loved Son.
103962	In
103963	him
103964	we have
103965	
103966	redemption
103967	through
103968	
103969	his blood,
103970	
103971	
103972	the forgiveness
103973	
103974	of our offenses,
103975	according to
103976	
103977	the riches
103978	
103979	of his grace
103980	
103981	that
103982	he lavished
103983	on us
103984	
103985	in
103986	all
103987	wisdom
103988	
103989	and insight.
103990	He did this when he revealed to us
103991	
103992	
103993	the mystery
103994	
103995	of his will,
103996	
103997	according to
103998	
103999	his good pleasure
104000	
104001	that
104002	he set forth
104003	in Christ,
104004	
104005	toward
104006	the administration
104007	
104008	of the fullness
104009	
104010	of the times,
104011	to head up
104012	
104013	all things
104014	in
104015	
104016	Christ –
104017	
104018	the things in
104019	
104020	heaven
104021	
104022	
104023	and the things on
104024	
104025	earth.
104026	
104027	
104028	In
104029	Christ
104030	we too
104031	have been claimed as God’s own possession,
104032	since we were predestined
104033	according to
104034	the purpose
104035	
104036	
104037	all things
104038	of him who accomplishes
104039	according to
104040	
104041	the counsel
104042	
104043	of his will
104044	
104045	so that
104046	
104047	we, who were
104048	
104049	would be to
104050	the praise
104051	of his glory.
104052	
104053	
104054	the first to set
104055	our hope on
104056	
104057	Christ,
104058	in
104059	
104060	
104061	
104062	And when you heard
104063	
104064	the word
104065	
104066	of truth
104067	
104068	(the gospel
104069	
104070	of your salvation) –
104071	
104072	Christ –
104073	
104074	
104075	when you believed
104076	you were marked with the seal
104077	
104078	Spirit,
104079	
104080	of the promised
104081	
104082	Holy
104083	who
104084	is
104085	the down payment
104086	
104087	of our inheritance,
104088	
104089	until
104090	the redemption
104091	
104092	of God’s own possession,
104093	to
104094	the praise
104095	
104096	of his glory.
104097	
104098	For
104099	
104100	this reason, because I
104101	have heard
104102	
104103	of
104104	
104105	your faith
104106	in
104107	
104108	the Lord
104109	Jesus
104110	
104111	
104112	and your love
104113	
104114	for
104115	all
104116	
104117	the saints,
104118	I do not
104119	cease
104120	to give thanks
104121	for you
104122	
104123	when I remember
104124	
104125	you in
104126	
104127	my prayers.
104128	
104129	I pray that
104130	
104131	the God
104132	
104133	of our Lord
104134	
104135	Jesus
104136	Christ,
104137	
104138	Father,
104139	
104140	the glorious
104141	will give you
104142	
104143	spiritual
104144	wisdom
104145	
104146	and revelation
104147	in
104148	your growing knowledge of him,
104149	
104150	have been enlightened –
104151	
104152	– since the eyes
104153	
104154	of your heart
104155	
104156	so that
104157	
104158	you can know
104159	
104160	what
104161	is
104162	
104163	the hope
104164	
104165	of his calling,
104166	
104167	what
104168	
104169	is the wealth
104170	
104171	of his glorious
104172	
104173	inheritance
104174	
104175	in
104176	
104177	the saints,
104178	
104179	and what
104180	
104181	is the incomparable
104182	greatness
104183	
104184	of his power
104185	
104186	toward us
104187	
104188	
104189	who believe,
104190	as displayed in
104191	
104192	the exercise
104193	
104194	of his immense
104195	
104196	strength.
104197	
104198	This power
104199	he exercised
104200	in
104201	
104202	Christ
104203	when he raised him
104204	
104205	from
104206	the dead
104207	
104208	and seated him
104209	at
104210	his right hand
104211	
104212	in
104213	
104214	the heavenly realms
104215	far above
104216	every
104217	rule
104218	
104219	and authority
104220	
104221	and power
104222	
104223	and dominion
104224	
104225	and every
104226	name
104227	that is named,
104228	not
104229	only
104230	in
104231	
104232	this age
104233	
104234	but
104235	
104236	also in
104237	
104238	the one to come.
104239	
104240	all things
104241	And God put
104242	under
104243	
104244	Christ’s feet,
104245	
104246	
104247	
104248	and gave him
104249	as head
104250	over
104251	all things.
104252	
104253	to the church
104254	
104255	Now the church is
104256	
104257	his body,
104258	
104259	
104260	the fullness
104261	
104262	
104263	all
104264	in
104265	all.
104266	of him who fills
104267	
104268	
104269	And although you were
104270	dead
104271	
104272	in your offenses
104273	
104274	
104275	and sins,
104276	
104277	in
104278	which
104279	you formerly
104280	lived
104281	according to
104282	
104283	present
104284	
104285	this world’s
104286	
104287	path, according to
104288	
104289	the ruler
104290	
104291	of the domain
104292	
104293	of the air,
104294	
104295	the ruler of the spirit
104296	
104297	that is now
104298	energizing
104299	
104300	
104301	the sons
104302	
104303	of disobedience,
104304	among
104305	whom
104306	
104307	
104308	all of us
104309	lived out
104310	also formerly
104311	our lives in
104312	
104313	the cravings
104314	
104315	of our flesh,
104316	
104317	indulging
104318	
104319	the desires
104320	
104321	of the flesh
104322	
104323	
104324	and the mind,
104325	
104326	and were
104327	children
104328	by nature
104329	of wrath
104330	even as
104331	
104332	
104333	the rest…
104334	
104335	But
104336	God,
104337	rich
104338	being
104339	in
104340	mercy,
104341	because of
104342	
104343	his great
104344	love
104345	
104346	with which
104347	he loved us,
104348	
104349	
104350	even though we were
104351	
104352	dead
104353	
104354	in offenses,
104355	made
104356	
104357	us alive together with Christ –
104358	by grace
104359	you are
104360	saved! –
104361	
104362	and he raised us up together with him
104363	and
104364	seated us together with him
104365	in
104366	the
104367	heavenly realms
104368	in
104369	Christ
104370	Jesus,
104371	to
104372	demonstrate
104373	in
104374	
104375	ages
104376	
104377	the coming
104378	
104379	the surpassing
104380	wealth
104381	
104382	of his grace
104383	
104384	in
104385	kindness
104386	toward us
104387	
104388	in
104389	Christ
104390	Jesus.
104391	
104392	For
104393	by grace
104394	you are
104395	saved
104396	through
104397	faith,
104398	
104399	
104400	and this is not
104401	from
104402	
104403	of God;
104404	
104405	yourselves, it is the gift
104406	it is not
104407	from
104408	works,
104409	so that
104410	no
104411	one
104412	can boast.
104413	
104414	For
104415	we are
104416	his creative work,
104417	having been created
104418	in
104419	Christ
104420	Jesus
104421	for
104422	works
104423	good
104424	that
104425	prepared beforehand
104426	
104427	God
104428	so
104429	
104430	
104431	we can do them.
104432	Therefore
104433	remember
104434	
104435	that formerly you,
104436	
104437	
104438	the Gentiles
104439	in
104440	the flesh –
104441	
104442	who are called
104443	“uncircumcision”
104444	by
104445	
104446	the so-called
104447	“circumcision”
104448	that is performed on
104449	the body
104450	by human hands –
104451	
104452	that you were
104453	
104454	time
104455	at that
104456	without
104457	the Messiah,
104458	alienated
104459	
104460	from the citizenship
104461	
104462	of Israel
104463	
104464	and strangers
104465	
104466	to the covenants
104467	
104468	of promise,
104469	hope
104470	no
104471	having
104472	
104473	and without God
104474	in
104475	
104476	the world.
104477	now
104478	But
104479	in
104480	Christ
104481	Jesus you
104482	
104483	
104484	who used
104485	to be
104486	far away
104487	have been brought
104488	near
104489	by
104490	
104491	the blood
104492	
104493	of Christ.
104494	
104495	For
104496	he is
104497	
104498	our peace,
104499	
104500	
104501	the one who made
104502	
104503	both
104504	groups into one
104505	
104506	
104507	the middle wall of partition,
104508	
104509	
104510	and who destroyed
104511	
104512	the hostility,
104513	in
104514	
104515	his flesh
104516	
104517	
104518	the law
104519	
104520	of commandments
104521	in
104522	decrees.
104523	when he nullified
104524	He did this to
104525	
104526	out of two,
104527	create
104528	in himself
104529	
104530	
104531	one
104532	new
104533	man
104534	thus making
104535	peace,
104536	
104537	and to reconcile
104538	
104539	them both
104540	in
104541	one
104542	body
104543	
104544	to God
104545	through
104546	
104547	the cross,
104548	has been killed.
104549	
104550	which the hostility
104551	by
104552	
104553	
104554	And he came
104555	and preached
104556	peace to you
104557	
104558	
104559	who were far off
104560	
104561	and peace
104562	
104563	to those who were near,
104564	
104565	so that through him
104566	
104567	have
104568	
104569	access
104570	
104571	we both
104572	in
104573	one
104574	Spirit
104575	to
104576	
104577	the Father.
104578	So
104579	then
104580	no longer
104581	you are
104582	foreigners
104583	
104584	and noncitizens,
104585	but
104586	you are
104587	fellow citizens
104588	
104589	with the saints
104590	
104591	and members of God’s household,
104592	
104593	
104594	because you have been built
104595	on
104596	
104597	the foundation
104598	
104599	of the apostles
104600	
104601	and prophets,
104602	
104603	as the cornerstone.
104604	
104605	with Christ
104606	Jesus himself
104607	In
104608	him
104609	the whole
104610	building,
104611	being joined together,
104612	grows
104613	into
104614	temple
104615	a holy
104616	in
104617	the Lord,
104618	in
104619	whom
104620	
104621	
104622	you also are being built together
104623	into
104624	a dwelling place
104625	
104626	of God
104627	in
104628	the Spirit.
104629	
104630	For this reason
104631	
104632	I, Paul,
104633	
104634	the prisoner
104635	
104636	of Christ
104637	Jesus
104638	for the sake of you
104639	
104640	
104641	Gentiles
104642	if
104643	indeed
104644	you have heard
104645	
104646	of the stewardship
104647	
104648	grace
104649	
104650	of God’s
104651	
104652	that was given to me
104653	
104654	for you,
104655	
104656	
104657	that by
104658	revelation
104659	was made known to me,
104660	
104661	
104662	the mystery
104663	as
104664	I wrote before
104665	
104666	briefly.
104667	
104668	
104669	this, you will be able
104670	When reading
104671	to understand
104672	
104673	my insight
104674	
104675	into
104676	
104677	the mystery
104678	
104679	of Christ
104680	(which
104681	in former
104682	generations
104683	was not
104684	disclosed
104685	
104686	
104687	
104688	to people
104689	as
104690	it has now
104691	been revealed
104692	
104693	to his holy
104694	apostles
104695	
104696	
104697	and prophets
104698	by
104699	the Spirit),
104700	are
104701	
104702	the Gentiles
104703	fellow heirs,
104704	
104705	fellow members of the body,
104706	
104707	and fellow partakers
104708	
104709	of the promise
104710	in
104711	Christ
104712	Jesus.
104713	namely, that through
104714	
104715	the gospel
104716	of this gospel
104717	I became
104718	a servant
104719	according to
104720	
104721	the gift
104722	
104723	grace
104724	
104725	of God’s
104726	
104727	that was given to me
104728	
104729	by
104730	
104731	the exercise
104732	
104733	of his power.
104734	
104735	
104736	
104737	To me – less than the least
104738	of all
104739	the saints –
104740	was given,
104741	
104742	this grace
104743	
104744	
104745	to the Gentiles
104746	to proclaim
104747	
104748	the unfathomable
104749	riches
104750	
104751	of Christ
104752	
104753	and to enlighten
104754	all things.
104755	everyone
104756	
104757	plan –
104758	
104759	about God’s secret
104760	
104761	the mystery that has been hidden
104762	for
104763	
104764	ages
104765	in
104766	
104767	God
104768	
104769	
104770	
104771	who has created
104772	The purpose of this enlightenment is that
104773	be disclosed
104774	should now
104775	
104776	to the rulers
104777	
104778	
104779	and the authorities
104780	in
104781	
104782	the heavenly realms.
104783	through
104784	
104785	the church
104786	
104787	the multifaceted
104788	wisdom
104789	
104790	of God
104791	This was according to
104792	purpose
104793	
104794	the eternal
104795	that
104796	he accomplished
104797	in
104798	
104799	Christ
104800	Jesus
104801	
104802	our Lord,
104803	
104804	in
104805	whom
104806	we have
104807	
104808	boldness
104809	
104810	access
104811	
104812	and confident
104813	to God by way of
104814	
104815	Christ’s faithfulness.
104816	
104817	For this reason
104818	I ask
104819	you not
104820	to lose heart
104821	because of
104822	
104823	what I am suffering
104824	
104825	for you,
104826	
104827	which
104828	is
104829	your glory.
104830	
104831	
104832	For this reason
104833	
104834	
104835	I kneel
104836	
104837	before
104838	
104839	the Father,
104840	from
104841	whom
104842	every
104843	family
104844	in
104845	heaven
104846	
104847	and on
104848	earth
104849	is named.
104850	I pray that
104851	he will grant
104852	
104853	according to
104854	
104855	the wealth
104856	
104857	of his glory
104858	
104859	with power
104860	you to be strengthened
104861	through
104862	
104863	his Spirit
104864	
104865	in
104866	
104867	the inner
104868	person,
104869	will dwell
104870	
104871	that Christ
104872	through
104873	
104874	faith,
104875	in
104876	
104877	your hearts
104878	
104879	in
104880	love,
104881	so that, because you have been rooted
104882	
104883	and grounded
104884	
104885	you will be able
104886	to comprehend
104887	with
104888	all
104889	
104890	the saints
104891	what
104892	
104893	is the breadth
104894	
104895	and length
104896	
104897	and height
104898	
104899	and depth,
104900	to know
104901	and thus
104902	
104903	surpasses
104904	
104905	knowledge,
104906	the love
104907	
104908	of Christ
104909	that
104910	so that you will be filled up
104911	to
104912	all
104913	
104914	the fullness
104915	
104916	of God.
104917	
104918	Now
104919	is able
104920	far beyond
104921	all
104922	to do
104923	
104924	that
104925	we ask
104926	or
104927	think,
104928	to him who by
104929	
104930	the power
104931	
104932	that is working
104933	within us
104934	
104935	
104936	
104937	to him be the glory
104938	in
104939	
104940	the church
104941	
104942	and in
104943	Christ
104944	Jesus
104945	to
104946	all
104947	
104948	generations,
104949	
104950	forever
104951	
104952	and ever.
104953	Amen.
104954	urge
104955	I, therefore,
104956	
104957	
104958	
104959	the prisoner
104960	for
104961	the Lord,
104962	worthily
104963	you to live
104964	
104965	of the calling
104966	with which
104967	you have been called,
104968	with
104969	all
104970	humility
104971	
104972	and gentleness,
104973	with
104974	patience,
104975	putting up with
104976	one another
104977	in
104978	love,
104979	making every effort
104980	to keep
104981	
104982	the unity
104983	
104984	of the Spirit
104985	in
104986	
104987	the bond
104988	
104989	of peace.
104990	There is one
104991	body
104992	
104993	and one
104994	Spirit,
104995	just as
104996	
104997	you too were called
104998	to
104999	the one
105000	hope
105001	
105002	of your calling,
105003	
105004	one
105005	Lord,
105006	one
105007	faith,
105008	one
105009	baptism,
105010	one
105011	God
105012	
105013	and Father
105014	of all,
105015	
105016	who is over
105017	all
105018	
105019	and through
105020	all
105021	
105022	and in
105023	all.
105024	one of us
105025	But
105026	to each
105027	
105028	was given
105029	
105030	grace
105031	according to
105032	
105033	the measure
105034	
105035	gift.
105036	
105037	of Christ’s
105038	Therefore
105039	it says,
105040	“When he ascended
105041	on
105042	high
105043	he captured
105044	captives;
105045	he gave
105046	gifts
105047	
105048	to men.”
105049	
105050	Now
105051	
105052	what
105053	is
105054	
105055	except
105056	
105057	
105058	the meaning of “he ascended,”
105059	that he also descended to
105060	
105061	the lower
105062	regions,
105063	
105064	namely, the earth?
105065	
105066	He, the very one who descended,
105067	
105068	is
105069	
105070	
105071	also the one who ascended
105072	above
105073	all
105074	
105075	the heavens,
105076	in order to
105077	fill
105078	
105079	all things.
105080	
105081	
105082	And he himself gave
105083	
105084	
105085	some as apostles,
105086	
105087	
105088	some as prophets,
105089	
105090	
105091	some as evangelists,
105092	
105093	and
105094	some as pastors
105095	
105096	and teachers,
105097	to
105098	
105099	equip
105100	
105101	the saints
105102	for
105103	the work
105104	of ministry,
105105	that is, to
105106	build up
105107	
105108	the body
105109	
105110	of Christ,
105111	until
105112	attain
105113	
105114	we all
105115	to
105116	
105117	the unity
105118	
105119	of the faith
105120	
105121	
105122	and of the knowledge
105123	
105124	of the Son
105125	
105126	of God –
105127	attaining to
105128	person,
105129	a mature
105130	
105131	the measure
105132	stature.
105133	
105134	full
105135	
105136	of Christ’s
105137	So
105138	no longer
105139	we are
105140	to be children,
105141	tossed back and forth by waves
105142	
105143	and carried about
105144	every
105145	wind
105146	
105147	of teaching
105148	by
105149	
105150	the trickery
105151	
105152	of people
105153	by
105154	who craftily carry out
105155	
105156	
105157	schemes.
105158	
105159	their deceitful
105160	practicing the truth
105161	But
105162	in
105163	love,
105164	grow up
105165	into
105166	
105167	
105168	we will in all things
105169	who
105170	is
105171	
105172	the head.
105173	Christ,
105174	From
105175	him
105176	the whole
105177	
105178	body
105179	grows, fitted
105180	
105181	and held together
105182	through
105183	every
105184	ligament.
105185	
105186	supporting
105187	
105188	
105189	
105190	
105191	one
105192	As each
105193	its part,
105194	
105195	
105196	
105197	the body
105198	does
105199	
105200	builds
105201	itself up
105202	in
105203	love.
105204	
105205	So
105206	I say this,
105207	
105208	and insist
105209	in
105210	the Lord, that you
105211	no longer
105212	
105213	live
105214	as
105215	
105216	
105217	the Gentiles
105218	do,
105219	in
105220	the futility
105221	
105222	of their thinking.
105223	
105224	They are darkened
105225	
105226	in their understanding,
105227	being
105228	alienated
105229	
105230	from the life
105231	
105232	of God
105233	because of
105234	
105235	the ignorance
105236	
105237	that is
105238	in them
105239	
105240	due to
105241	
105242	the hardness
105243	
105244	of their hearts.
105245	
105246	Because they
105247	are callous,
105248	themselves
105249	they have given
105250	over
105251	to indecency
105252	for
105253	the practice
105254	of impurity
105255	of every kind
105256	with
105257	greediness.
105258	
105259	But you
105260	did not
105261	like this,
105262	learn
105263	
105264	about Christ
105265	if
105266	indeed
105267	
105268	you heard about him
105269	
105270	in him,
105271	
105272	and were taught
105273	just as
105274	is
105275	the truth
105276	in
105277	
105278	Jesus.
105279	to lay aside
105280	
105281	You were taught with reference to
105282	
105283	your former
105284	way of life
105285	
105286	the old
105287	man
105288	
105289	who is being corrupted
105290	in accordance with
105291	
105292	desires,
105293	
105294	deceitful
105295	to be renewed
105296	
105297	
105298	in the spirit
105299	
105300	of your mind,
105301	
105302	
105303	and to put on
105304	
105305	the new
105306	man
105307	
105308	in
105309	God’s image –
105310	who has been created
105311	in
105312	righteousness
105313	
105314	and holiness
105315	
105316	that comes from truth.
105317	Therefore,
105318	having laid aside
105319	
105320	falsehood,
105321	of you speak
105322	the truth
105323	each one
105324	with
105325	
105326	his neighbor,
105327	
105328	
105329	because we are
105330	of one another.
105331	members
105332	Be angry
105333	
105334	and do not
105335	sin;
105336	
105337	let the sun
105338	do not
105339	go down
105340	on
105341	
105342	the cause of your anger.
105343	
105344	Do not
105345	give
105346	an opportunity.
105347	
105348	the devil
105349	
105350	The one who steals
105351	no longer;
105352	must steal
105353	
105354	instead
105355	he must labor,
105356	doing
105357	
105358	with his own
105359	hands,
105360	
105361	good
105362	so that
105363	he will have
105364	something to share
105365	
105366	need.
105367	with the one who has
105368	
105369	word
105370	unwholesome
105371	of
105372	
105373	your mouth,
105374	
105375	You must let no
105376	come out
105377	but
105378	only
105379	what
105380	is beneficial
105381	for
105382	the building up
105383	
105384	of the one in need,
105385	that
105386	it would give
105387	grace
105388	
105389	to those who hear.
105390	
105391	And do not
105392	grieve
105393	
105394	Spirit
105395	
105396	the Holy
105397	
105398	of God,
105399	by
105400	whom
105401	you were sealed
105402	for
105403	the day
105404	of redemption.
105405	all
105406	bitterness,
105407	
105408	anger,
105409	
105410	wrath,
105411	
105412	quarreling,
105413	
105414	and slanderous talk –
105415	You must put away
105416	
105417	
105418	
105419	indeed all
105420	malice.
105421	Instead, be
105422	
105423	to
105424	one another,
105425	kind
105426	compassionate,
105427	forgiving
105428	one another,
105429	just as
105430	
105431	
105432	God
105433	in
105434	Christ
105435	also forgave you.
105436	
105437	be
105438	Therefore,
105439	imitators
105440	
105441	of God
105442	as
105443	children
105444	dearly loved
105445	
105446	and live
105447	in
105448	love,
105449	just as
105450	
105451	
105452	Christ
105453	also loved us
105454	
105455	
105456	and gave
105457	himself
105458	for us,
105459	
105460	offering
105461	
105462	a sacrificial
105463	
105464	to God.
105465	
105466	
105467	and fragrant
105468	be either sexual immorality,
105469	But
105470	
105471	impurity
105472	of any kind,
105473	or
105474	greed,
105475	there must not
105476	
105477	among you
105478	
105479	as
105480	these are not fitting
105481	for the saints.
105482	
105483	Neither should there be vulgar speech,
105484	
105485	foolish talk,
105486	or
105487	coarse jesting –
105488	all of which
105489	
105490	are out of character –
105491	but
105492	rather
105493	thanksgiving.
105494	of this one thing:
105495	For
105496	
105497	you can be confident
105498	that
105499	person who is
105500	immoral,
105501	
105502	impure,
105503	or
105504	greedy
105505	(such a person
105506	is
105507	an idolater)
105508	no
105509	has
105510	any inheritance
105511	in
105512	
105513	the kingdom
105514	
105515	of Christ
105516	
105517	and God.
105518	Let nobody
105519	
105520	deceive you
105521	with empty
105522	words,
105523	because of
105524	
105525	for
105526	comes
105527	
105528	wrath
105529	
105530	these things God’s
105531	on
105532	
105533	the sons
105534	
105535	of disobedience.
105536	do not
105537	Therefore
105538	be
105539	sharers with them,
105540	
105541	you were
105542	for
105543	at one time
105544	darkness,
105545	now
105546	but
105547	you are light
105548	in
105549	the Lord.
105550	like
105551	children
105552	of light –
105553	Live
105554	
105555	for
105556	the fruit
105557	
105558	of the light
105559	consists in
105560	all
105561	goodness,
105562	
105563	righteousness,
105564	
105565	and truth –
105566	trying to learn
105567	what
105568	is
105569	pleasing
105570	
105571	to the Lord.
105572	
105573	Do not
105574	participate
105575	
105576	deeds
105577	
105578	in the unfruitful
105579	
105580	of darkness,
105581	rather
105582	but
105583	
105584	expose them.
105585	
105586	For
105587	in secret
105588	the things they do
105589	
105590	
105591	shameful
105592	are
105593	
105594	even to mention.
105595	
105596	But
105597	all things
105598	being exposed
105599	by
105600	
105601	the light
105602	are made visible.
105603	everything
105604	For
105605	
105606	made visible
105607	light,
105608	is
105609	and for this reason
105610	it says:
105611	“Awake,
105612	
105613	O sleeper!
105614	
105615	Rise
105616	from
105617	
105618	the dead,
105619	
105620	will shine on you!”
105621	
105622	
105623	and Christ
105624	consider
105625	Therefore
105626	carefully
105627	how
105628	you live –
105629	not
105630	as
105631	unwise
105632	but
105633	as
105634	wise,
105635	taking advantage
105636	
105637	of every opportunity,
105638	
105639	
105640	because the days
105641	evil.
105642	are
105643	For
105644	
105645	this reason do not
105646	be
105647	foolish,
105648	but
105649	be wise by understanding
105650	what
105651	
105652	will is.
105653	
105654	the Lord’s
105655	
105656	And do not
105657	get drunk
105658	with wine,
105659	by
105660	which
105661	is
105662	debauchery,
105663	but
105664	be filled
105665	
105666	the Spirit,
105667	speaking
105668	to one another
105669	
105670	in psalms,
105671	
105672	hymns,
105673	
105674	songs,
105675	and spiritual
105676	singing
105677	
105678	and making music
105679	
105680	in your hearts
105681	
105682	
105683	to the Lord,
105684	giving thanks
105685	always
105686	for
105687	each other
105688	in
105689	the name
105690	
105691	of our Lord
105692	
105693	Jesus
105694	Christ,
105695	
105696	to God
105697	
105698	the Father
105699	and submitting to
105700	one another
105701	out of
105702	reverence
105703	for Christ.
105704	
105705	Wives,
105706	
105707	submit to your
105708	husbands
105709	as
105710	
105711	to the Lord,
105712	
105713	because the husband
105714	is
105715	the head
105716	
105717	of the wife
105718	as
105719	
105720	
105721	also Christ
105722	is the head
105723	
105724	of the church (he himself
105725	
105726	being the savior
105727	
105728	of the body).
105729	But
105730	as
105731	
105732	the church
105733	submits
105734	
105735	to Christ,
105736	so
105737	
105738	
105739	also wives
105740	
105741	should submit to their husbands
105742	in
105743	everything.
105744	
105745	Husbands,
105746	love
105747	
105748	your wives
105749	just as
105750	
105751	
105752	Christ
105753	loved
105754	
105755	the church
105756	
105757	himself
105758	and gave
105759	for her
105760	
105761	to
105762	
105763	sanctify her
105764	by cleansing her
105765	
105766	with the washing
105767	
105768	of the water
105769	by
105770	the word,
105771	so that
105772	he may present
105773	
105774	to himself
105775	as glorious –
105776	
105777	the church
105778	not
105779	having
105780	a stain
105781	or
105782	wrinkle,
105783	or
105784	any
105785	
105786	such blemish,
105787	but
105788	
105789	
105790	holy
105791	
105792	and blameless.
105793	In the same way
105794	ought
105795	
105796	
105797	husbands
105798	to love
105799	
105800	their
105801	wives
105802	as
105803	
105804	their own
105805	bodies.
105806	
105807	He who loves
105808	
105809	his
105810	wife
105811	himself.
105812	loves
105813	no one
105814	For
105815	has ever
105816	
105817	his own
105818	body,
105819	hated
105820	but
105821	he feeds
105822	
105823	it and takes care of it,
105824	
105825	just as
105826	
105827	
105828	Christ
105829	
105830	also does the church,
105831	
105832	members
105833	because we are
105834	
105835	of his body.
105836	
105837	For
105838	
105839	will leave
105840	this reason a man
105841	
105842	his father
105843	
105844	
105845	and mother
105846	
105847	and will be joined
105848	to
105849	
105850	his wife,
105851	
105852	
105853	will become
105854	
105855	and the two
105856	
105857	flesh.
105858	one
105859	
105860	This mystery
105861	
105862	great –
105863	is
105864	
105865	but
105866	I am actually speaking
105867	with reference to
105868	Christ
105869	
105870	
105871	
105872	and the church.
105873	Nevertheless,
105874	
105875	
105876	
105877	
105878	one
105879	each
105880	
105881	his own
105882	wife
105883	
105884	of you must also love
105885	as
105886	he loves himself,
105887	
105888	and
105889	the wife
105890	
105891	must respect
105892	
105893	her husband.
105894	
105895	Children,
105896	obey
105897	
105898	your parents
105899	
105900	in
105901	the Lord,
105902	
105903	for
105904	this is
105905	right.
105906	“Honor
105907	
105908	your father
105909	
105910	
105911	
105912	and mother,”
105913	which
105914	is
105915	commandment
105916	the first
105917	accompanied by
105918	a promise, namely,
105919	“that
105920	go well with you
105921	
105922	it will
105923	
105924	and that you will
105925	live a long time
105926	on
105927	
105928	the earth.”
105929	
105930	
105931	Fathers,
105932	do not
105933	provoke
105934	
105935	your children to anger,
105936	
105937	but
105938	raise
105939	them up
105940	in
105941	the discipline
105942	
105943	and instruction
105944	of the Lord.
105945	
105946	Slaves,
105947	obey
105948	
105949	
105950	your human
105951	masters
105952	with
105953	fear
105954	
105955	and trembling,
105956	in
105957	the sincerity
105958	
105959	of your heart,
105960	
105961	as
105962	
105963	to Christ,
105964	not
105965	like
105966	those who do their work only when someone is watching –
105967	as
105968	people-pleasers –
105969	but
105970	as
105971	slaves
105972	of Christ
105973	doing
105974	
105975	the will
105976	
105977	of God
105978	from
105979	the heart.
105980	Obey with
105981	enthusiasm,
105982	though serving
105983	as
105984	
105985	the Lord
105986	
105987	and not
105988	people,
105989	because you know
105990	
105991	that each person,
105992	if
105993	something
105994	he does
105995	good,
105996	
105997	this will be rewarded
105998	by
105999	the Lord.
106000	whether
106001	slave
106002	or
106003	free,
106004	
106005	
106006	Masters,
106007	the same way,
106008	your slaves
106009	treat
106010	
106011	
106012	giving up
106013	
106014	the use of threats,
106015	because you know
106016	
106017	
106018	
106019	
106020	
106021	
106022	that both you and they have the same master
106023	and there is

106029	
106030	with him.
106031	
106032	
106033	
106034	Finally, be strengthened
106035	in
106036	the Lord
106037	
106038	and in
106039	
106040	the strength
106041	
106042	of his power.
106043	
106044	Clothe
106045	
106046	yourselves with the full armor
106047	
106048	of God,
106049	so that
106050	
106051	you will be able
106052	
106053	to stand
106054	against
106055	
106056	the schemes
106057	
106058	of the devil.
106059	
106060	not
106061	is
106062	
106063	
106064	For our struggle

106068	flesh
106069	but
106070	against
106071	
106072	the rulers,
106073	against
106074	
106075	the powers,
106076	against
106077	
106078	the world rulers
106079	
106080	of this darkness,
106081	
106082	against
106083	
106084	the spiritual forces
106085	
106086	of evil
106087	in
106088	
106089	the heavens.
106090	For
106091	
106092	this reason, take up
106093	
106094	the full armor
106095	
106096	of God
106097	so that
106098	you may be able
106099	to stand

106112	
106113	around your waist,

106116	truth

106118	by putting on
106119	
106120	the breastplate
106121	
106122	of righteousness,
106123	
106124	by fitting
106125	
106126	your feet
106127	with
106128	the preparation
106129	
106130	that comes from the good news
106131	
106132	of peace,
106133	and in
106134	all
106135	of this, by taking up
106136	
106137	the shield
106138	
106139	of faith
106140	with
106141	which
106142	you can

106144	
106145	arrows
106146	
106147	of the evil one.
106148

106151	
106152	
106153	the helmet

106163	is
106164	the word
106165	of God).
106166	With
106167	every
106168	prayer
106169	
106170	and petition,
106171	pray

106178	and to
106179	
106180	this end be alert,

106352	day
106353	until
106354	
106355	now.
106356	For I am sure
106357	
106358	
106359	
106360	
106361	of this very thing, that the one who began

106367	it until
106368	the day

106370	Jesus.
106371	For
106372	it is
106373	right for me

106452	filled
106453	with the fruit
106454	of righteousness
106455	
106456	that comes through
106457	Jesus
106458	Christ
106459	to

106469	
106470	
106471	that my situation
106472	
106473	
106474	to
106475	advance
106476	
106477	the gospel:
106478	has actually turned out
106479	
106480	
106481	that I am in prison
106482	
106483	
106484	for the sake of
106485	Christ,
106486	knows
106487	
106488	The whole
106489	
106490	imperial guard
106491	
106492	
106493	else
106494	and everyone
106495	
106496	
106497	and most
106498	
106499	of the brothers and sisters,
106500	in
106501	the Lord because of my
106502	having confidence
106503	
106504	imprisonment,
106505	
106506	now more than ever
106507	dare
106508	fearlessly.
106509	
106510	the word
106511	to speak
106512	Some,
106513	
106514	to be sure,
106515	from
106516	envy
106517	
106518	and rivalry,
106519	others
106520	but
106521	
106522	from
106523	goodwill.
106524	
106525	Christ
106526	are preaching
106527	
106528	
106529	The latter do so from
106530	love
106531	because they know
106532	
106533	here for
106534	the defense
106535	
106536	of the gospel.
106537	that I am placed
106538	
106539	
106540	from
106541	selfish ambition,
106542	
106543	Christ
106544	The former proclaim
106545	not
106546	sincerely,
106547	because they think
106548	trouble for me in my
106549	they can cause
106550	
106551	imprisonment.
106552	
106553	What
106554	is the result?
106555	Only
106556	
106557	that in every
106558	way,
106559	whether
106560	in pretense
106561	or
106562	in truth,
106563	Christ
106564	is being proclaimed,
106565	
106566	and in
106567	
106568	this I rejoice.
106569	Yes,
106570	
106571	and I will continue to rejoice,
106572	I know
106573	for
106574	
106575	
106576	
106577	that this will turn out
106578	for
106579	my deliverance
106580	through
106581	
106582	
106583	your prayers
106584	
106585	and the help
106586	
106587	of the Spirit
106588	of Jesus
106589	Christ.
106590	
106591	
106592	My confident
106593	
106594	hope
106595	
106596	
106597	is that I will in
106598	no way
106599	be ashamed
106600	but
106601	that with
106602	complete
106603	boldness,
106604	as
106605	always,
106606	
106607	even now
106608	will be exalted
106609	Christ
106610	in
106611	
106612	my body,
106613	
106614	whether
106615	
106616	I live
106617	or
106618	
106619	die.
106620	
106621	For to me,
106622	
106623	living
106624	is Christ
106625	
106626	
106627	and dying
106628	is gain.
106629	if
106630	Now
106631	
106632	I am to go on living
106633	in
106634	the body,
106635	
106636	
106637	this will mean productive
106638	work for me,
106639	
106640	which
106641	I prefer:
106642	yet I don’t
106643	know
106644	I feel torn
106645	
106646	between
106647	
106648	the two,
106649	
106650	a desire
106651	because I have
106652	to
106653	
106654	depart
106655	
106656	with
106657	Christ,
106658	and be
106659	
106660	
106661	by far,
106662	which is better
106663	
106664	but
106665	your sake that I remain
106666	in
106667	
106668	the body.
106669	it is more vital
106670	for
106671	
106672	
106673	
106674	And since I am sure of this,
106675	I know
106676	
106677	that I will remain
106678	
106679	and continue
106680	with all of you
106681	
106682	for the sake
106683	
106684	
106685	of your progress
106686	
106687	and joy
106688	
106689	in the faith,
106690	so that what you
106691	
106692	can be proud
106693	
106694	of may increase
106695	because of me
106696	Christ
106697	Jesus,
106698	in
106699	
106700	
106701	
106702	when I
106703	come
106704	back
106705	to you.
106706	
106707	Only
106708	yourselves in a manner worthy
106709	
106710	of the gospel
106711	
106712	of Christ
106713	conduct
106714	so that –
106715	whether
106716	I come
106717	
106718	and see you
106719	
106720	or whether
106721	I remain absent –
106722	I should hear
106723	
106724	
106725	
106726	
106727	that you are standing firm
106728	in
106729	one
106730	spirit,
106731	with one
106732	mind,
106733	by contending side by side
106734	
106735	for the faith
106736	
106737	of the gospel,
106738	
106739	not
106740	being intimidated
106741	in
106742	any way
106743	and by
106744	
106745	by your opponents.
106746	This
106747	is
106748	
106749	a sign
106750	of their destruction,
106751	
106752	but
106753	of your salvation –
106754	
106755	
106756	a sign which is from
106757	God.
106758	
106759	
106760	For it has been granted to you
106761	
106762	for him,
106763	in Christ
106764	not
106765	only
106766	
106767	
106768	
106769	to believe
106770	but
106771	
106772	
106773	
106774	
106775	also to suffer
106776	
106777	
106778	the same conflict
106779	since you are encountering
106780	that
106781	you saw me
106782	
106783	
106784	
106785	face and now
106786	hear that I am facing.
106787	
106788	
106789	if
106790	there is any
106791	Therefore,
106792	encouragement
106793	in
106794	Christ,
106795	
106796	any
106797	comfort
106798	provided by love,
106799	
106800	any
106801	fellowship
106802	in the Spirit,
106803	
106804	any
106805	affection
106806	
106807	or mercy,
106808	complete
106809	
106810	
106811	my joy
106812	
106813	
106814	
106815	and be of the same mind,
106816	
106817	
106818	the same love,
106819	by having
106820	being united in spirit,
106821	
106822	one purpose.
106823	and having
106824	
106825	Instead of being motivated by
106826	selfish ambition
106827	or
106828	
106829	vanity,
106830	
106831	
106832	each of you should, in humility,
106833	one another
106834	be moved to treat
106835	as more important
106836	than yourself.
106837	not
106838	
106839	only about your own
106840	Each
106841	of you should be concerned
106842	interests, but
106843	
106844	
106845	about the interests of others as well.
106846	
106847	
106848	You should have
106849	the same attitude toward
106850	
106851	one another that
106852	
106853	
106854	Christ
106855	Jesus had,
106856	who
106857	in
106858	the form
106859	of God
106860	though he existed
106861	did not
106862	grasped,
106863	regard
106864	
106865	as something to be
106866	equality
106867	with God
106868	but
106869	himself
106870	emptied
106871	on the form
106872	of a slave,
106873	by taking
106874	by
106875	looking like
106876	other men,
106877	
106878	
106879	and by sharing
106880	
106881	in
106882	human nature.
106883	He humbled
106884	himself,
106885	by becoming
106886	obedient
106887	to the point of
106888	death –
106889	death
106890	even
106891	on a cross!
106892	As a result
106893	
106894	
106895	God
106896	
106897	highly exalted him
106898	
106899	and gave him
106900	
106901	
106902	the name
106903	
106904	that is above
106905	every
106906	name,
106907	so that
106908	at
106909	
106910	the name
106911	of Jesus
106912	every
106913	knee
106914	will bow –
106915	in heaven
106916	
106917	and on earth
106918	
106919	and under the earth –
106920	
106921	and every
106922	tongue
106923	confess
106924	
106925	is Lord
106926	that Jesus
106927	Christ
106928	to
106929	the glory
106930	of God
106931	the Father.
106932	So then,
106933	my dear friends,
106934	
106935	just as
106936	you have always
106937	obeyed,
106938	not
106939	
106940	in
106941	
106942	my presence
106943	
106944	only
106945	but
106946	
106947	even
106948	more
106949	in
106950	
106951	my absence,
106952	
106953	with
106954	awe
106955	
106956	and reverence,
106957	
106958	your
106959	salvation
106960	continue working out
106961	God.
106962	for
106963	is
106964	
106965	the one bringing forth
106966	in
106967	
106968	
106969	
106970	you both the desire
106971	
106972	
106973	and the effort –
106974	for the sake of
106975	
106976	his good pleasure –
106977	everything
106978	Do
106979	without
106980	grumbling
106981	
106982	or arguing,
106983	so that
106984	you may be
106985	blameless
106986	
106987	and pure,
106988	children
106989	of God
106990	without blemish
106991	though you live in
106992	society,
106993	a crooked
106994	
106995	and perverse
106996	in
106997	which
106998	you shine
106999	as
107000	lights
107001	in
107002	the world
107003	to the word
107004	of life
107005	by holding on
107006	so that on
107007	I will have a reason to boast
107008	
107009	in
107010	the day
107011	of Christ
107012	
107013	that I did not
107014	in
107015	vain
107016	run
107017	nor
107018	
107019	vain.
107020	labor
107021	But
107022	even if
107023	
107024	I am being poured out like a drink offering
107025	on
107026	
107027	the sacrifice
107028	
107029	and service
107030	
107031	of your faith,
107032	
107033	I am glad
107034	
107035	and rejoice together
107036	with all of you.
107037	
107038	
107039	And
107040	
107041	
107042	
107043	in the same way you also should be glad
107044	
107045	and rejoice together with me.
107046	
107047	I hope
107048	Now
107049	in
107050	the Lord
107051	Jesus
107052	Timothy to you
107053	soon,
107054	to send
107055	
107056	so that
107057	I too
107058	may be encouraged
107059	by hearing news
107060	
107061	about you.
107062	
107063	there is no one
107064	For
107065	
107066	here like
107067	him who
107068	will readily
107069	
107070	his deep concern for you.
107071	
107072	demonstrate
107073	
107074	Others
107075	
107076	
107077	their own
107078	are busy with
107079	concerns, not
107080	
107081	those of Jesus
107082	Christ.
107083	
107084	But
107085	his qualifications,
107086	
107087	you know
107088	
107089	that like
107090	working with his father,
107091	a son
107092	with me
107093	
107094	he served
107095	in advancing
107096	
107097	the gospel.
107098	
107099	
107100	So
107101	I hope
107102	to send
107103	
107104	
107105	I know
107106	
107107	more about my situation,
107108	
107109	him as soon as
107110	I am confident
107111	though
107112	in
107113	the Lord
107114	
107115	
107116	
107117	to see you soon.
107118	that I too will be coming
107119	it necessary
107120	But
107121	for now I have considered
107122	Epaphroditus
107123	
107124	For he is my brother,
107125	
107126	coworker
107127	
107128	and fellow soldier,
107129	
107130	
107131	
107132	and your messenger
107133	
107134	and minister to me in my
107135	
107136	need.
107137	
107138	to send
107139	to you.
107140	
107141	Indeed,
107142	he greatly missed
107143	
107144	all
107145	
107146	
107147	of you and was distressed
107148	because
107149	you heard
107150	
107151	that he had been ill.
107152	
107153	In fact
107154	he became so ill
107155	that he nearly
107156	died.
107157	But
107158	
107159	God
107160	showed mercy to him –
107161	
107162	not to him
107163	
107164	and
107165	only,
107166	but
107167	
107168	
107169	also to me – so that
107170	I would not
107171	grief
107172	on top of
107173	grief.
107174	have
107175	
107176	Therefore
107177	I am all the more eager to send him,
107178	
107179	so that
107180	when you see him
107181	
107182	again
107183	you can rejoice
107184	and I
107185	free from anxiety.
107186	can be
107187	welcome him
107188	So
107189	
107190	in
107191	the Lord
107192	with
107193	great
107194	joy,
107195	
107196	
107197	people like him,
107198	and honor
107199	
107200	
107201	since it was because of
107202	
107203	the work
107204	of Christ
107205	
107206	died.
107207	
107208	that he almost
107209	
107210	He risked his life
107211	so that
107212	he could make up
107213	
107214	
107215	for your inability
107216	
107217	to
107218	
107219	serve me.
107220	
107221	Finally,
107222	my brothers and sisters,
107223	
107224	rejoice
107225	in
107226	the Lord!
107227	
107228	
107229	To write
107230	
107231	
107232	
107233	this again is no
107234	trouble to me,
107235	
107236	and
107237	it is a safeguard for you.
107238	Beware
107239	
107240	of the dogs,
107241	beware
107242	
107243	of the evil
107244	workers,
107245	beware
107246	
107247	of those who mutilate the flesh!
107248	
107249	For
107250	we are
107251	
107252	the circumcision,
107253	
107254	by the Spirit
107255	of God,
107256	the ones who worship
107257	
107258	exult
107259	in
107260	Christ
107261	Jesus,
107262	
107263	and do not
107264	on
107265	human credentials
107266	rely
107267	– though
107268	
107269	he has
107270	good reasons
107271	
107272	in
107273	human credentials,
107274	mine too are significant. If
107275	someone
107276	thinks
107277	
107278	to put confidence
107279	
107280	
107281	
107282	I have more:
107283	I was circumcised
107284	on the eighth day,
107285	from
107286	the people
107287	of Israel
107288	and the tribe
107289	of Benjamin,
107290	a Hebrew
107291	of
107292	Hebrews.
107293	I lived according to
107294	the law
107295	as a Pharisee.
107296	In
107297	my zeal
107298	for God I persecuted
107299	
107300	the church.
107301	According to
107302	the righteousness
107303	
107304	stipulated in
107305	the law
107306	I was
107307	blameless.
107308	But
107309	
107310	
107311	
107312	these assets
107313	
107314	I have come to regard
107315	because of
107316	
107317	Christ.
107318	as liabilities
107319	
107320	More than that,
107321	
107322	I now regard
107323	all things
107324	as liabilities
107325	compared
107326	for
107327	
107328	to the far greater value
107329	
107330	of knowing
107331	Christ
107332	Jesus
107333	
107334	my Lord,
107335	
107336	
107337	whom
107338	
107339	of all things –
107340	I have suffered the loss
107341	
107342	indeed, I regard
107343	them as dung! –
107344	that
107345	Christ,
107346	I may gain
107347	
107348	and be found
107349	in him,
107350	
107351	not
107352	because I have
107353	my own
107354	righteousness
107355	
107356	derived from
107357	the law,
107358	but
107359	I have the righteousness that
107360	because
107361	faithfulness –
107362	comes by way of Christ’s
107363	
107364	from
107365	God
107366	a righteousness
107367	that is in fact based on
107368	
107369	Christ’s faithfulness.
107370	
107371	My aim is to know him,
107372	
107373	
107374	
107375	to experience the power
107376	
107377	of his resurrection,
107378	
107379	
107380	
107381	to share
107382	
107383	in his sufferings,
107384	
107385	and to be like him
107386	
107387	death,
107388	in his
107389	
107390	and so, somehow,
107391	to attain
107392	to
107393	
107394	the resurrection
107395	
107396	from
107397	the dead.
107398	Not
107399	
107400	that I have already
107401	attained this –
107402	that is,
107403	I have not already
107404	been perfected –
107405	I strive
107406	but
107407	
107408	
107409	to lay hold
107410	of
107411	that for which
107412	
107413	also laid hold of me.
107414	
107415	Christ
107416	Jesus
107417	Brothers and sisters,
107418	
107419	myself
107420	I do not
107421	consider
107422	to have attained
107423	I am single-minded:
107424	this. Instead
107425	
107426	
107427	the things that are behind
107428	Forgetting
107429	
107430	and
107431	for the things that are ahead,
107432	reaching out
107433	with
107434	this goal in mind,
107435	I strive
107436	toward
107437	
107438	the prize
107439	
107440	of the upward
107441	call
107442	
107443	of God
107444	in
107445	Christ
107446	Jesus.
107447	let those of us who
107448	Therefore
107449	are “perfect”
107450	
107451	embrace
107452	
107453	this point of view. If
107454	
107455	otherwise,
107456	you think
107457	
107458	
107459	
107460	God
107461	
107462	will reveal to you the error of your ways.
107463	Nevertheless,
107464	to
107465	
107466	the standard that we have already attained.
107467	
107468	
107469	let us live up
107470	imitators of me,
107471	
107472	Be
107473	brothers and sisters,
107474	
107475	and watch carefully
107476	
107477	this way,
107478	those who are living
107479	just as
107480	you have us
107481	as an example.
107482	
107483	many
107484	For
107485	live,
107486	about whom
107487	I have often
107488	told you,
107489	
107490	now,
107491	and
107492	
107493	with tears,
107494	I tell
107495	
107496	you that they are the enemies
107497	
107498	of the cross
107499	
107500	of Christ.
107501	Their
107502	
107503	end
107504	is destruction,
107505	their
107506	
107507	god
107508	
107509	is the belly,
107510	
107511	
107512	they exult
107513	in
107514	
107515	their shame,
107516	
107517	
107518	
107519	earthly things.
107520	and they think about
107521	
107522	But
107523	
107524	our citizenship
107525	in
107526	heaven –
107527	is
107528	from
107529	there,
107530	
107531	a savior
107532	and we also eagerly await
107533	the Lord
107534	Jesus
107535	Christ,
107536	who
107537	will transform
107538	
107539	bodies
107540	
107541	these humble
107542	
107543	of ours into the likeness
107544	
107545	body
107546	
107547	of his glorious
107548	
107549	by means of
107550	
107551	that power
107552	
107553	by which he is able
107554	
107555	
107556	to subject
107557	
107558	
107559	all things to himself.
107560	So then,
107561	my brothers and sisters,
107562	
107563	dear friends
107564	
107565	whom I long to see,
107566	my joy
107567	
107568	and crown,
107569	
107570	in this way,
107571	stand
107572	in
107573	the Lord
107574	my dear friends!
107575	to Euodia
107576	I appeal
107577	
107578	and to Syntyche
107579	
107580	
107581	
107582	to agree
107583	in
107584	the Lord.
107585	Yes,
107586	I say
107587	
107588	
107589	also to you, true
107590	companion,
107591	help them.
107592	
107593	They
107594	in
107595	
107596	the gospel ministry along with me
107597	have struggled together
107598	
107599	
107600	
107601	and Clement
107602	
107603	
107604	and my other
107605	coworkers,
107606	
107607	whose
107608	
107609	names
107610	are in
107611	the book
107612	of life.
107613	Rejoice
107614	in
107615	the Lord
107616	always.
107617	Again
107618	I say,
107619	rejoice!
107620	
107621	gentleness.
107622	see your
107623	Let
107624	
107625	everyone
107626	
107627	The Lord
107628	is near!
107629	Do not
107630	be anxious
107631	about anything. Instead,
107632	in
107633	every situation,
107634	
107635	through prayer
107636	
107637	
107638	and petition
107639	with
107640	thanksgiving,
107641	
107642	your requests
107643	
107644	tell
107645	to
107646	
107647	God.
107648	
107649	
107650	And the peace
107651	
107652	of God
107653	
107654	that surpasses
107655	all
107656	understanding
107657	will guard
107658	
107659	your hearts
107660	
107661	
107662	
107663	and minds
107664	
107665	in
107666	Christ
107667	Jesus.
107668	
107669	Finally,
107670	brothers and sisters,
107671	whatever
107672	is
107673	true,
107674	whatever
107675	is worthy of respect,
107676	whatever
107677	is just,
107678	whatever
107679	is pure,
107680	whatever
107681	is lovely,
107682	whatever
107683	is commendable,
107684	if
107685	something
107686	is excellent
107687	
107688	
107689	
107690	or praiseworthy,
107691	
107692	think about these things.
107693	And what
107694	
107695	you learned
107696	
107697	and received
107698	
107699	and heard
107700	
107701	and saw
107702	in me,
107703	
107704	
107705	do
107706	
107707	
107708	these things. And the God
107709	
107710	of peace
107711	will be
107712	with you.
107713	
107714	I have
107715	
107716	joy in
107717	the Lord
107718	great
107719	
107720	because now
107721	at last
107722	you have again expressed
107723	
107724	for me.
107725	
107726	your concern
107727	
107728	
107729	
107730	(Now I know you were concerned before
107731	had no opportunity to do anything.)
107732	but
107733	I am not
107734	
107735	
107736	this because I am in need,
107737	saying
107738	
107739	for
107740	I have learned
107741	in
107742	any circumstance.
107743	to be
107744	content
107745	
107746	I have experienced
107747	
107748	times of need
107749	
107750	
107751	and times of abundance.
107752	In
107753	any
107754	
107755	
107756	and every circumstance
107757	I have learned the secret of contentment,
107758	
107759	whether I go satisfied
107760	
107761	or hungry,
107762	
107763	have plenty
107764	
107765	or nothing.
107766	to do all things
107767	I am able
107768	through
107769	
107770	the one who strengthens me.
107771	
107772	Nevertheless,
107773	well
107774	you did
107775	to share with me
107776	
107777	
107778	in my trouble.
107779	know,
107780	And as you
107781	
107782	
107783	Philippians
107784	
107785	at
107786	the beginning
107787	
107788	of my gospel ministry,
107789	when
107790	I left
107791	
107792	Macedonia,
107793	no
107794	
107795	church
107796	shared with me
107797	in
107798	this matter
107799	of giving
107800	
107801	and receiving
107802	
107803	except you
107804	
107805	alone.
107806	
107807	
107808	For even in
107809	Thessalonica
107810	
107811	on more than one occasion
107812	
107813	
107814	something for
107815	
107816	my need.
107817	
107818	you sent
107819	I do not
107820	
107821	say this because I am seeking
107822	
107823	a gift.
107824	Rather,
107825	I seek
107826	
107827	the credit
107828	
107829	that abounds
107830	to
107831	your account.
107832	
107833	I have received
107834	For
107835	everything,
107836	
107837	and I have plenty.
107838	I have all
107839	I need because I received
107840	from
107841	Epaphroditus what you
107842	
107843	
107844	
107845	offering,
107846	sent – a fragrant
107847	sacrifice,
107848	an acceptable
107849	very pleasing
107850	
107851	to God.
107852	
107853	And
107854	my God
107855	
107856	will supply
107857	your every
107858	need
107859	
107860	according to
107861	
107862	riches
107863	
107864	in
107865	his glorious
107866	
107867	Christ
107868	Jesus.
107869	
107870	
107871	be given to God
107872	
107873	our Father
107874	
107875	
107876	May glory
107877	
107878	
107879	forever
107880	
107881	and ever.
107882	Amen.
107883	Give greetings
107884	to all
107885	the saints
107886	in
107887	Christ
107888	Jesus.

107953	Christ,
107954	We always
107955	for you,
107956	
107957	when we pray
107958	since we heard
107959	
107960	about your faith
107961	
107962	in
107963	Christ
107964	Jesus
107965	
107966	
107967	and the love
107968	that
107969	you have
107970	for
107971	all
107972	
107973	the saints.
107974	Your faith and love have arisen from
107975	
107976	the hope
107977	
107978	laid up for you
107979	
107980	in
107981	
107982	heaven,
107983	which
107984	you have heard about
107985	in
107986	
107987	the message
107988	
107989	of truth,
107990	
107991	the gospel
107992	
107993	that has come
107994	to you.
107995	
107996	Just as
107997	
107998	in
107999	the entire
108000	
108001	world
108002	this gospel is
108003	bearing fruit
108004	
108005	and growing,
108006	so
108007	it has also been bearing fruit and growing
108008	among you
108009	
108010	from
108011	
108012	the first day
108013	you heard
108014	
108015	it and understood
108016	
108017	the grace
108018	
108019	of God
108020	in
108021	truth.
108022	
108023	You learned
108024	the gospel from
108025	Epaphras,
108026	
108027	our dear
108028	fellow slave –

108030	
108031	
108032	a faithful

108041	
108042	
108043	
108044	of your love
108045	in
108046	the Spirit.
108047	For
108048	
108049	
108050

108052

108100	
108101	his glorious

108126	He
108127	delivered us
108128	
108129	from
108130	
108131	the power
108132	
108133	of darkness

108166	were created

108204	and all things

108206	
108207	are held together
108208	
108209	
108210	He is
108211	
108212	the head
108213	
108214	of the body,
108215	
108216	the church,
108217	
108218	
108219	as well as the beginning,
108220	the firstborn
108221	from
108222	
108223	the dead,
108224	so that he himself
108225	may become
108226	in
108227	all things.
108228	
108229	first
108230	
108231	in the Son
108232	
108233	For God was pleased
108234	to have all
108235	
108236	his fullness
108237	dwell
108238	
108239	and through him
108240	
108241	to reconcile
108242	
108243	all things
108244	to himself
108245	
108246	by making peace
108247	through
108248	
108249	the blood
108250	
108251	of his cross –
108252	
108253	through him,
108254	
108255	whether
108256	
108257	things on
108258	
108259	earth
108260	or
108261	
108262	things in
108263	
108264	heaven.
108265	
108266	
108267	at one time
108268	And you were
108269	strangers
108270	
108271	and enemies
108272	
108273	in your minds
108274	as expressed through
108275	
108276	deeds,
108277	
108278	your evil
108279	now
108280	but
108281	he has reconciled
108282	you by
108283	
108284	body
108285	
108286	his physical
108287	
108288	through
108289	
108290	death
108291	to present you
108292	
108293	holy,
108294	
108295	without blemish,
108296	
108297	and blameless
108298	before him –
108299	
108300	if
108301	indeed
108302	you remain
108303	in the
108304	faith,
108305	established
108306	
108307	and firm,
108308	
108309	without
108310	shifting
108311	from
108312	
108313	the hope
108314	
108315	of the gospel
108316	that
108317	you heard.
108318	
108319	This gospel has also been preached
108320	in
108321	all
108322	creation
108323	
108324	under
108325	
108326	heaven,
108327	
108328	have become
108329	
108330	and I, Paul,
108331	its servant.
108332	Now
108333	I rejoice
108334	in
108335	
108336	my sufferings
108337	for you,
108338	
108339	
108340	and I fill up
108341	
108342	what is lacking
108343	
108344	in the sufferings
108345	
108346	of Christ.
108347	in
108348	
108349	my physical body –
108350	
108351	for the sake of
108352	
108353	his body,
108354	
108355	
108356	
108357	
108358	the church –
108359	
108360	I became
108361	
108362	a servant
108363	of the church according to
108364	
108365	the stewardship
108366	
108367	from God –
108368	
108369	given to me
108370	
108371	for
108372	
108373	you – in order to complete
108374	
108375	the word
108376	
108377	of God,
108378	
108379	that is, the mystery
108380	
108381	that has been kept hidden
108382	from
108383	
108384	ages
108385	
108386	
108387	
108388	and generations,
108389	has now
108390	but
108391	been revealed
108392	
108393	to his saints.
108394	
108395	which
108396	wanted
108397	
108398	God
108399	to make known
108400	
108401	
108402	riches
108403	
108404	to them the glorious
108405	
108406	of this mystery
108407	
108408	among
108409	
108410	the Gentiles,
108411	
108412	is
108413	Christ
108414	in you,
108415	
108416	
108417	the hope
108418	
108419	of glory.
108420	him
108421	
108422	We proclaim
108423	by instructing
108424	all
108425	people
108426	
108427	and teaching
108428	all
108429	person
108430	with
108431	every
108432	wisdom
108433	so that
108434	we may present
108435	
108436	
108437	mature
108438	in
108439	Christ.
108440	Toward
108441	this goal
108442	
108443	I also labor,
108444	struggling
108445	according to
108446	
108447	his power
108448	
108449	
108450	works
108451	in me.
108452	
108453	
108454	that powerfully
108455	I want
108456	For
108457	
108458	you to know
108459	how great
108460	a struggle
108461	I have
108462	for you,
108463	
108464	
108465	
108466	and for those in
108467	Laodicea,
108468	
108469	and for those
108470	who have not
108471	met me
108472	
108473	face to face.
108474	
108475	
108476	
108477	My goal is that
108478	may be encouraged,
108479	
108480	their hearts,
108481	
108482	having been knit together
108483	in
108484	love,
108485	
108486	
108487	and that they may have all
108488	the riches
108489	
108490	that assurance
108491	
108492	brings in their understanding
108493	
108494	of the knowledge
108495	
108496	of the mystery
108497	
108498	of God,
108499	namely, Christ,
108500	in
108501	whom
108502	are
108503	all
108504	
108505	the treasures
108506	
108507	of wisdom
108508	
108509	and knowledge.
108510	hidden
108511	
108512	I say
108513	this so that
108514	no one
108515	
108516	will deceive you
108517	through
108518	arguments that sound reasonable.
108519	though
108520	For
108521	
108522	
108523	in body,
108524	I am absent from you
108525	
108526	
108527	in spirit,
108528	with you
108529	
108530	I am present
108531	rejoicing
108532	
108533	to see
108534	
108535	
108536	your morale
108537	
108538	
108539	and the firmness
108540	
108541	in
108542	Christ.
108543	of your faith
108544	
108545	just as
108546	Therefore,
108547	you received
108548	
108549	Christ
108550	Jesus
108551	
108552	as Lord,
108553	your lives in him,
108554	
108555	continue to live
108556	rooted
108557	
108558	and built up
108559	in him
108560	
108561	
108562	and firm
108563	
108564	in your faith
108565	just as
108566	you were taught,
108567	and overflowing
108568	with
108569	thankfulness.
108570	Be careful
108571	not
108572	to allow anyone
108573	
108574	
108575	
108576	to captivate you
108577	through
108578	
108579	philosophy
108580	
108581	an empty,
108582	deceitful
108583	that is according to
108584	
108585	traditions
108586	
108587	human
108588	according to
108589	
108590	and the elemental spirits
108591	
108592	of the world,
108593	
108594	and not
108595	
108596	Christ.
108597	
108598	For in him
108599	
108600	lives
108601	all
108602	
108603	the fullness
108604	
108605	of deity
108606	in bodily form,
108607	
108608	and you have been
108609	in him,
108610	
108611	filled
108612	who
108613	is
108614	
108615	the head
108616	over every
108617	ruler
108618	
108619	and authority.
108620	In
108621	him
108622	
108623	you also were circumcised –
108624	however, with a circumcision
108625	not,
108626	performed by human hands, but by
108627	
108628	the removal
108629	
108630	body,
108631	
108632	of the fleshly
108633	that is, through
108634	
108635	the circumcision
108636	
108637	done by Christ.
108638	Having been buried with him
108639	
108640	in
108641	
108642	
108643	
108644	him
108645	
108646	baptism, you also have been raised with
108647	through
108648	
108649	your faith
108650	
108651	in the power
108652	
108653	of God
108654	
108655	who raised him
108656	
108657	from
108658	the dead.
108659	
108660	
108661	dead
108662	And even though you were
108663	in
108664	
108665	your transgressions
108666	
108667	
108668	and in the uncircumcision
108669	
108670	of your flesh,
108671	
108672	he nevertheless made you
108673	
108674	alive with him,
108675	
108676	having forgiven
108677	
108678	all
108679	
108680	your transgressions.
108681	He has destroyed
108682	
108683	what was against us,
108684	
108685	a certificate
108686	
108687	of indebtedness expressed in decrees
108688	
108689	
108690	opposed to us.
108691	
108692	
108693	
108694	He has taken
108695	
108696	
108697	
108698	it away by nailing it
108699	
108700	
108701	to the cross.
108702	Disarming
108703	
108704	the rulers
108705	
108706	
108707	and authorities,
108708	he has made a
108709	by the cross.
108710	public
108711	disgrace of them, triumphing over them
108712	
108713	
108714	
108715	do not
108716	Therefore
108717	let anyone
108718	
108719	judge you
108720	with respect to
108721	food
108722	or
108723	in
108724	drink,
108725	or
108726	
108727	the matter
108728	of a feast,
108729	
108730	new moon,
108731	or
108732	Sabbath days –
108733	these
108734	are
108735	only the shadow
108736	
108737	of the things to come,
108738	
108739	but
108740	the reality
108741	
108742	is Christ!
108743	Let no one
108744	
108745	pass judgment on you.
108746	who delights
108747	in
108748	false humility
108749	
108750	and the worship
108751	
108752	of angels
108753	That person
108754	he has supposedly seen,
108755	goes on at great lengths about what
108756	with empty notions
108757	but he is puffed up
108758	by
108759	
108760	mind.
108761	
108762	his fleshly
108763	
108764	
108765	He has not
108766	held fast
108767	
108768	to the head
108769	from
108770	whom
108771	the whole
108772	
108773	body,
108774	through
108775	
108776	and sinews,
108777	
108778	its ligaments
108779	supported
108780	
108781	and knit together
108782	grows
108783	
108784	with a growth
108785	
108786	that is from God.
108787	If
108788	you have died
108789	with
108790	Christ
108791	to
108792	
108793	the elemental spirits
108794	
108795	of the world,
108796	why
108797	to them as though
108798	you lived
108799	in
108800	the world?
108801	do you submit
108802	“Do not
108803	handle!
108804	Do not
108805	taste!
108806	Do not
108807	touch!”
108808	These
108809	are
108810	all
108811	destined to
108812	perish
108813	
108814	with use,
108815	founded as they are on
108816	
108817	commands
108818	
108819	and teachings.
108820	
108821	human
108822	though they
108823	
108824	the appearance
108825	Even
108826	have
108827	of wisdom
108828	with
108829	their self-imposed worship
108830	
108831	and humility
108832	
108833	achieved by an unsparing treatment
108834	of the body –
108835	no
108836	a wisdom with
108837	value –
108838	true
108839	they in reality result in
108840	indulgence.
108841	
108842	fleshly
108843	if
108844	Therefore,
108845	you have been raised
108846	
108847	with Christ,
108848	
108849	the things above,
108850	keep seeking
108851	where
108852	
108853	Christ
108854	is,
108855	at
108856	the right hand
108857	
108858	of God.
108859	seated
108860	
108861	about things above,
108862	Keep thinking
108863	not
108864	
108865	things on
108866	
108867	the earth,
108868	you have died
108869	for
108870	
108871	
108872	and your life
108873	
108874	is hidden
108875	with
108876	
108877	Christ
108878	in
108879	
108880	God.
108881	When
108882	
108883	Christ
108884	appears,
108885	
108886	(who is your life)
108887	
108888	then
108889	
108890	
108891	with him.
108892	
108893	you too will be revealed
108894	in
108895	glory
108896	put to deat
108897	So
108898	
108899	h whatever in your nature
108900	
108901	belongs to
108902	
108903	the earth:
108904	sexual immorality,
108905	impurity,
108906	shameful passion,
108907	desire,
108908	evil
108909	
108910	
108911	and greed
108912	which
108913	is
108914	idolatry.
108915	Because of
108916	these things
108917	is coming
108918	
108919	the wrath
108920	
108921	of God
108922	
108923	
108924	on the sons
108925	
108926	of disobedience.
108927	your lives in
108928	this way
108929	
108930	
108931	You also lived
108932	at one time,
108933	when
108934	you used to live
108935	among them.
108936	
108937	now,
108938	But
108939	put off
108940	
108941	
108942	
108943	all such things
108944	as anger,
108945	rage,
108946	malice,
108947	slander,
108948	abusive language
108949	from
108950	
108951	your mouth.
108952	
108953	Do not
108954	lie
108955	to
108956	one another
108957	since you have put off
108958	
108959	the old
108960	man
108961	with
108962	
108963	its practices
108964	
108965	
108966	and have been clothed
108967	
108968	with the new man
108969	
108970	that is being renewed
108971	in
108972	knowledge
108973	according to
108974	the image
108975	
108976	of the one who created it.
108977	
108978	Here
108979	there is neither
108980	
108981	Greek
108982	
108983	nor Jew,
108984	circumcised
108985	
108986	or uncircumcised,
108987	barbarian,
108988	Scythian,
108989	slave
108990	or free,
108991	but
108992	
108993	is all
108994	
108995	and in
108996	all.
108997	Christ
108998	clothe
108999	Therefore,
109000	as
109001	the elect
109002	
109003	of God,
109004	holy
109005	
109006	and dearly loved,
109007	yourselves with a heart
109008	of mercy,
109009	kindness,
109010	humility,
109011	gentleness,
109012	and patience,
109013	bearing
109014	with one another
109015	
109016	and forgiving
109017	one another,
109018	if
109019	someone
109020	against
109021	anyone else.
109022	happens to have
109023	a complaint
109024	Just as
109025	
109026	
109027	the Lord
109028	has forgiven you,
109029	
109030	so you also forgive others.
109031	
109032	
109033	to
109034	all these
109035	And
109036	
109037	
109038	virtues add love,
109039	which
109040	is
109041	bond.
109042	
109043	the perfect
109044	
109045	
109046	Let the peace
109047	
109048	of Christ
109049	be in control
109050	in
109051	
109052	your heart
109053	
109054	(for
109055	
109056	
109057	you were in fact called
109058	as
109059	one
109060	body to this peace),
109061	
109062	thankful.

109126	love
109127	
109128	your wives
109129	
109130	and do not
109131	be embittered
109132	against them.
109133	
109134	
109135	Children,
109136	obey
109137	
109138	your parents
109139	in

109186	to the Lord
109187	
109188	and not

109191	
109192	from
109193	the Lord
109194	that you will receive
109195	
109196	as the reward.

109226	
109227	that you also have
109228	a master

109248	
109249	a door
109250

109256	of Christ,
109257	for
109258	which

109260	I am in chains.
109261	Pray that
109262	I may make it

109531	you constantly
109532	because we recall
109533	
109534	
109535	your work
109536	
109537	of faith
109538	
109539	
109540	and labor
109541	
109542	of love
109543	
109544	
109545	and endurance
109546	
109547	of hope
109548	
109549	in our Lord
109550	
109551	Jesus
109552	Christ.
109553	in the presence
109554	
109555	of our God
109556	
109557	and Father
109558	
109559	We know,
109560	brothers and sisters
109561	loved
109562	by
109563	
109564	God,
109565	
109566	that he has chosen you,
109567	
109568	
109569	
109570	in that our gospel
109571	
109572	did not
109573	come
109574	to you
109575	
109576	in
109577	words,
109578	merely
109579	but
109580	
109581	in
109582	power
109583	
109584	and in
109585	Spirit
109586	the Holy
109587	
109588	and with
109589	conviction
109590	deep
109591	
109592	(surely you recall
109593	
109594	the character we displayed when we came
109595	among you
109596	
109597	to help you).
109598	
109599	
109600	
109601	imitators of us
109602	
109603	And you became
109604	
109605	
109606	and of the Lord,
109607	when you received
109608	
109609	the message
109610	
109611	affliction.
109612	despite great
109613	with
109614	joy
109615	Spirit,
109616	that comes from the Holy
109617	As a result
109618	you became
109619	
109620	an example
109621	to all
109622	
109623	the believers
109624	in
109625	
109626	Macedonia
109627	
109628	and in
109629	
109630	Achaia.
109631	from you
109632	
109633	For
109634	has echoed forth
109635	
109636	the message
109637	
109638	of the Lord
109639	not
109640	just
109641	in
109642	
109643	Macedonia
109644	
109645	in
109646	
109647	and Achaia,
109648	but
109649	
109650	every
109651	place
109652	
109653	reports of your faith
109654	
109655	
109656	in
109657	
109658	God
109659	have spread,
109660	so that
109661	we do not
109662	need
109663	
109664	
109665	to say
109666	anything.
109667	
109668	For
109669	
109670	
109671	people everywhere report
109672	
109673	how
109674	you welcomed us
109675	to
109676	
109677	
109678	and how
109679	you turned
109680	
109681	
109682	God
109683	from
109684	
109685	idols
109686	to serve
109687	God
109688	the living
109689	
109690	and true
109691	
109692	and to wait for
109693	
109694	his Son
109695	
109696	from
109697	
109698	heaven,
109699	whom
109700	he raised
109701	from
109702	
109703	the dead,
109704	Jesus
109705	
109706	our deliverer
109707	
109708	from
109709	
109710	wrath.
109711	
109712	the coming
109713	
109714	For
109715	you yourselves know,
109716	brothers and sisters,
109717	
109718	about our coming
109719	
109720	
109721	to you –
109722	
109723	
109724	it has not
109725	to be purposeless.
109726	proven
109727	But
109728	although we suffered earlier
109729	
109730	and were mistreated
109731	as
109732	you know,
109733	in
109734	Philippi,
109735	we had the courage
109736	in
109737	
109738	our God
109739	
109740	declare
109741	to
109742	
109743	
109744	to you the gospel
109745	
109746	of God
109747	in
109748	spite of much
109749	opposition.
109750	
109751	For
109752	the appeal
109753	
109754	we make does not
109755	come from
109756	error
109757	or
109758	
109759	impurity
109760	or
109761	with
109762	deceit,
109763	but
109764	just as
109765	we have been approved
109766	by
109767	
109768	God
109769	to be entrusted
109770	
109771	with the gospel,
109772	so
109773	we declare
109774	it, not
109775	
109776	people
109777	to please
109778	but
109779	God,
109780	
109781	who examines
109782	
109783	our hearts.
109784	
109785	we never
109786	For
109787	
109788	with
109789	speech,
109790	flattering
109791	appeared
109792	as
109793	you know,
109794	nor
109795	with
109796	a pretext
109797	for greed –
109798	God
109799	is our witness –
109800	nor
109801	to seek
109802	from
109803	people,
109804	glory
109805	either
109806	from you
109807	
109808	or
109809	from
109810	others,
109811	although we could have imposed
109812	
109813	our weight
109814	
109815	as
109816	of Christ;
109817	apostles
109818	instead
109819	we became
109820	little children
109821	
109822	among you.
109823	
109824	Like
109825	
109826	a nursing mother
109827	caring
109828	
109829	for her own
109830	children,
109831	with such
109832	affection
109833	
109834	for you we were happy
109835	to share with you
109836	
109837	not
109838	only
109839	
109840	the gospel
109841	
109842	of God
109843	but
109844	
109845	
109846	also our own
109847	lives,
109848	because
109849	dear to us.
109850	
109851	you had become
109852	you recall,
109853	For
109854	brothers and sisters,
109855	
109856	our toil
109857	
109858	
109859	
109860	and drudgery:
109861	night
109862	
109863	and day
109864	By working
109865	so as
109866	
109867	not
109868	to impose a burden
109869	on any of you,
109870	
109871	we preached
109872	to you
109873	
109874	
109875	the gospel
109876	
109877	of God.
109878	
109879	You are witnesses,
109880	
109881	
109882	and so is God,
109883	as
109884	to how holy
109885	
109886	and righteous
109887	
109888	and blameless
109889	
109890	
109891	toward you who believe.
109892	our conduct was
109893	As
109894	you know,
109895	as
109896	one of you
109897	we treated each
109898	
109899	
109900	a father
109901	children,
109902	treats his own
109903	exhorting
109904	
109905	
109906	and encouraging
109907	
109908	you and insisting
109909	that
109910	
109911	you live
109912	
109913	in a way worthy
109914	
109915	of God
109916	
109917	who calls you
109918	
109919	to
109920	
109921	his own
109922	kingdom
109923	
109924	and his glory.
109925	
109926	And so
109927	
109928	
109929	
109930	thank
109931	
109932	God
109933	we too constantly
109934	
109935	that when you received
109936	message
109937	that you heard
109938	from us,
109939	
109940	
109941	God’s
109942	you accepted
109943	it not
109944	message,
109945	as a human
109946	but
109947	as
109948	is,
109949	it truly
109950	message,
109951	God’s
109952	which
109953	
109954	is at work
109955	among
109956	
109957	
109958	you who believe.
109959	
109960	For
109961	imitators,
109962	you became
109963	brothers and sisters,
109964	
109965	churches
109966	
109967	of God’s
109968	
109969	that are
109970	in
109971	
109972	Judea,
109973	in
109974	Christ
109975	Jesus
109976	
109977	
109978	
109979	because you too suffered
109980	
109981	
109982	the same things from
109983	
109984	your own
109985	countrymen
109986	as
109987	
109988	
109989	they in fact did from
109990	
109991	the Jews,
109992	
109993	
109994	
109995	both the Lord
109996	who killed
109997	Jesus
109998	
109999	
110000	and the prophets
110001	
110002	
110003	and persecuted us
110004	
110005	
110006	to God
110007	severely. They are displeasing
110008	
110009	to all
110010	people,
110011	and are opposed
110012	because they hinder us
110013	
110014	
110015	to the Gentiles
110016	from speaking
110017	so that
110018	they may be saved.
110019	Thus
110020	
110021	fill up
110022	
110023	
110024	their measure of sins,
110025	they constantly
110026	has come
110027	but
110028	upon them
110029	
110030	
110031	wrath
110032	
110033	completely.
110034	
110035	But
110036	brothers and sisters,
110037	when we were separated
110038	from you,
110039	
110040	for
110041	time
110042	a short
110043	(in presence,
110044	not
110045	in affection)
110046	we became all the more
110047	fervent
110048	
110049	in person.
110050	
110051	to see you
110052	in
110053	our great
110054	desire
110055	For
110056	we wanted
110057	to come
110058	to you
110059	
110060	
110061	
110062	(I, Paul,
110063	
110064	in fact tried again
110065	
110066	and again)
110067	
110068	thwarted us.
110069	
110070	
110071	but Satan
110072	who
110073	For
110074	
110075	is our hope
110076	or
110077	joy
110078	or
110079	crown
110080	to boast of
110081	
110082	Is it not of course you?
110083	
110084	
110085	before
110086	
110087	our Lord
110088	
110089	Jesus
110090	at
110091	
110092	
110093	his coming?
110094	
110095	For
110096	you are
110097	
110098	our glory
110099	
110100	
110101	
110102	and joy!
110103	So
110104	it no longer,
110105	when we could bear
110106	we decided
110107	to stay on
110108	in
110109	Athens
110110	alone.
110111	
110112	We sent
110113	Timothy,
110114	
110115	our brother
110116	
110117	
110118	and fellow worker
110119	
110120	for God
110121	in
110122	
110123	the gospel
110124	
110125	of Christ,
110126	to
110127	
110128	strengthen
110129	
110130	
110131	you and encourage
110132	you about
110133	
110134	your faith,
110135	
110136	
110137	so that no one
110138	would be shaken
110139	by
110140	
110141	these afflictions.
110142	
110143	
110144	For
110145	you yourselves know
110146	
110147	for this.
110148	
110149	that we are destined
110150	
110151	For
110152	in fact when
110153	with you,
110154	
110155	we were
110156	we were telling
110157	
110158	
110159	you in advance that we would
110160	suffer affliction,
110161	and so
110162	
110163	it has happened,
110164	
110165	as you well know.
110166	
110167	So
110168	when I
110169	it no longer,
110170	could bear
110171	I sent
110172	to
110173	
110174	find out
110175	
110176	about your faith,
110177	
110178	for fear that
110179	somehow
110180	the tempter
110181	
110182	
110183	tempted you
110184	
110185	
110186	useless.
110187	had proven
110188	
110189	and our toil
110190	
110191	now
110192	But
110193	has come
110194	Timothy
110195	to us
110196	
110197	from
110198	
110199	
110200	you and given us
110201	
110202	
110203	the good news of your faith
110204	
110205	
110206	and love
110207	
110208	
110209	
110210	
110211	think of us
110212	
110213	with affection
110214	and that you always
110215	and long
110216	
110217	to see us
110218	just as we also long to see you!
110219	
110220	
110221	
110222	through
110223	So
110224	we were reassured
110225	brothers and sisters,
110226	in
110227	
110228	about you,
110229	all
110230	
110231	our distress
110232	
110233	and affliction,
110234	
110235	
110236	
110237	
110238	your faith.
110239	
110240	For now
110241	we are alive
110242	again, if
110243	
110244	you stand firm
110245	in

110255	
110256	for you,
110257	for all
110258	
110259	the joy
110260	
110261	we feel
110262	because of you
110263	
110264	before
110265	
110266	our God?
110267	
110268	earnestly night
110269	
110270	and day

110272	We pray
110273	to
110274	
110275	see you

110278	in person
110279	
110280	and make up
110281	
110282	what may be lacking
110283	
110284	in your faith.
110285	
110286	
110287	Now
110288	
110289	may God

110301	
110302	to you.

110304	
110305	And
110306	
110307	may the Lord
110308	cause
110309	
110310	you to increase and abound
110311	
110312	in love
110313	for
110314	one another
110315	
110316	and for
110317	all,
110318	just as
110319	
110320	
110321	we do for you,
110322	
110323	so that
110324	
110325	are strengthened
110326	
110327	
110328	your hearts
110329	to be blameless
110330	in
110331	holiness
110332	before
110333	
110334	our God
110335	
110336	and Father
110337	
110338	at
110339	
110340	the coming
110341	
110342	of our Lord
110343	
110344	Jesus
110345	with
110346	all
110347	
110348	his saints.
110349	
110350	
110351	Finally
110352	then,
110353	brothers and sisters,
110354	we ask
110355	
110356	
110357	you and urge
110358	you in
110359	the Lord
110360	Jesus,
110361	that
110362	as
110363	you received
110364	instruction from us
110365	
110366	
110367	about how
110368	you must
110369	
110370	live
110371	
110372	and please
110373	God
110374	(as you are
110375	in fact
110376	living)
110377	that
110378	you do so more
110379	and more.
110380	you know
110381	For
110382	what
110383	commands
110384	we gave you
110385	
110386	through
110387	
110388	the Lord
110389	Jesus.
110390	
110391	For
110392	this is
110393	will: that you
110394	
110395	God’s
110396	
110397	become holy,
110398	
110399	that you keep away
110400	
110401	from
110402	
110403	sexual immorality,
110404	of you know
110405	that each
110406	
110407	
110408	his own
110409	body
110410	how to possess
110411	in
110412	holiness
110413	
110414	and honor,
110415	not
110416	in
110417	passion
110418	lustful
110419	like
110420	
110421	
110422	the Gentiles
110423	
110424	who do not
110425	know
110426	
110427	God.
110428	
110429	no one
110430	should violate the rights
110431	
110432	or take advantage
110433	In
110434	
110435	this matter
110436	
110437	of his brother
110438	
110439	of him, because
110440	is the avenger
110441	the Lord
110442	in
110443	all
110444	
110445	these cases, as
110446	
110447	we also told you
110448	earlier
110449	
110450	and warned you solemnly.
110451	did not
110452	For
110453	call us
110454	
110455	
110456	God
110457	to
110458	impurity
110459	but
110460	in
110461	holiness.
110462	Consequently
110463	
110464	the one who rejects
110465	this is not
110466	human authority
110467	rejecting
110468	but
110469	
110470	God,
110471	
110472	
110473	who gives
110474	
110475	Spirit
110476	
110477	
110478	his Holy
110479	to you.
110480	
110481	on the topic of
110482	Now
110483	
110484	brotherly love
110485	no
110486	need
110487	you have
110488	for anyone to write
110489	you,
110490	yourselves
110491	for
110492	you
110493	taught by God
110494	are
110495	to
110496	
110497	love
110498	one another.
110499	
110500	And indeed
110501	you are practicing it
110502	
110503	toward
110504	
110505	
110506	the brothers and sisters
110507	
110508	in
110509	all
110510	
110511	all of Macedonia.
110512	we urge you,
110513	But
110514	
110515	brothers and sisters,
110516	to do so more
110517	and more,
110518	
110519	to aspire
110520	to lead a quiet life,
110521	
110522	to attend
110523	
110524	to your own business,
110525	
110526	and to work
110527	
110528	with your own
110529	hands,
110530	
110531	as
110532	
110533	we commanded you.
110534	In this way
110535	you will live
110536	a decent
110537	life before
110538	
110539	outsiders
110540	
110541	and not
110542	in need.
110543	be
110544	we do not
110545	want
110546	Now
110547	
110548	you to be uninformed,
110549	brothers and sisters,
110550	about
110551	
110552	those who are asleep,
110553	so that
110554	you will not
110555	grieve
110556	like
110557	
110558	
110559	the rest
110560	
110561	no
110562	who have
110563	hope.
110564	if
110565	For
110566	we believe
110567	
110568	that Jesus
110569	died
110570	
110571	and rose
110572	again, so
110573	
110574	
110575	also we believe that God
110576	
110577	those who have fallen asleep
110578	as
110579	
110580	Christians.
110581	will bring
110582	with him
110583	
110584	
110585	For
110586	
110587	we tell you
110588	this by
110589	the word
110590	of the Lord,
110591	
110592	
110593	
110594	that we who are alive,
110595	
110596	who are left
110597	until
110598	
110599	the coming
110600	
110601	of the Lord,
110602	
110603	will surely not
110604	go ahead
110605	
110606	of those who have fallen asleep.
110607	
110608	
110609	
110610	For the Lord himself
110611	with
110612	a shout of command,
110613	with
110614	the voice
110615	of the archangel,
110616	
110617	and with
110618	the trumpet
110619	of God,
110620	will come down
110621	from
110622	heaven
110623	
110624	
110625	and the dead
110626	in
110627	Christ
110628	will rise
110629	first.
110630	Then
110631	
110632	
110633	we who are alive,
110634	
110635	who are left,
110636	together
110637	with them
110638	
110639	will be suddenly caught up
110640	in
110641	the clouds
110642	to
110643	meet
110644	
110645	the Lord
110646	in
110647	the air.
110648	
110649	And so
110650	we will always
110651	with
110652	the Lord.
110653	be
110654	Therefore
110655	encourage
110656	one another
110657	with
110658	
110659	these words.
110660	
110661	on the topic of
110662	Now
110663	
110664	times
110665	
110666	
110667	and seasons,
110668	brothers and sisters,
110669	no
110670	need
110671	you have
110672	
110673	for anything to be written to you.
110674	
110675	For
110676	quite well
110677	you know
110678	
110679	that the day
110680	of the Lord
110681	as
110682	a thief
110683	in
110684	the night.
110685	in the same way
110686	will come
110687	Now when
110688	they are saying,
110689	“There is peace
110690	
110691	and security,”
110692	then
110693	sudden
110694	
110695	comes on them,
110696	destruction
110697	like
110698	
110699	labor pains
110700	
110701	on
110702	
110703	a pregnant woman,
110704	
110705	
110706	and they will surely not
110707	escape.
110708	
110709	But you,
110710	brothers and sisters,
110711	not
110712	are
110713	in
110714	the darkness
110715	for
110716	
110717	the day
110718	
110719	like
110720	a thief would.
110721	to overtake you
110722	all
110723	For you
110724	
110725	sons
110726	of the light
110727	are
110728	
110729	and sons
110730	of the day.
110731	not
110732	We are
110733	of the night
110734	nor
110735	of the darkness.
110736	So
110737	then
110738	we must not
110739	sleep
110740	as
110741	
110742	the rest,
110743	but
110744	must stay alert
110745	
110746	and sober.
110747	
110748	For
110749	those who sleep,
110750	at night
110751	sleep
110752	
110753	
110754	
110755	are drunk at night.
110756	and those who get drunk
110757	
110758	But
110759	of the day,
110760	since we are
110761	we must stay sober
110762	by putting on
110763	the breastplate
110764	of faith
110765	
110766	and love
110767	
110768	and as a helmet
110769	our hope
110770	for salvation.
110771	
110772	did not
110773	destine us
110774	
110775	
110776	For God
110777	for
110778	wrath
110779	but
110780	for
110781	gaining
110782	salvation
110783	through
110784	
110785	our Lord
110786	
110787	Jesus
110788	Christ.
110789	
110790	He died
110791	for us
110792	
110793	so that
110794	whether
110795	we are alert
110796	or
110797	asleep
110798	together
110799	with him.
110800	
110801	we will come to life
110802	Therefore
110803	encourage
110804	one another
110805	
110806	and build up
110807	each
110808	
110809	other,
110810	just as
110811	
110812	you are in fact doing.
110813	we ask you,
110814	Now
110815	
110816	brothers and sisters,
110817	to acknowledge
110818	
110819	those who labor
110820	among
110821	
110822	
110823	you and preside over you
110824	
110825	in
110826	the Lord
110827	
110828	and admonish you,
110829	
110830	
110831	and to esteem them
110832	
110833	
110834	most highly in
110835	love
110836	because of
110837	
110838	their work.
110839	
110840	Be at peace
110841	among
110842	yourselves.
110843	we urge you,
110844	And
110845	
110846	brothers and sisters,
110847	admonish
110848	
110849	the undisciplined,
110850	comfort
110851	
110852	the discouraged,
110853	help
110854	
110855	the weak,
110856	be patient
110857	toward
110858	all.
110859	See
110860	that no
110861	one
110862	evil
110863	
110864	evil
110865	to anyone,
110866	pays back

110873	for
110874	one another
110875	
110876	for
110877	and for all.
110878	Always
110879	rejoice,
110880	constantly
110881	pray,
110882	in
110883	everything
110884	give thanks.

110890	Christ
110891	Jesus.

110893	
110894	
110895	the Spirit.
110896	Do not
110897	extinguish
110898	prophecies with contempt.
110899	Do not
110900	treat
110901	all things;

111021	
111022	because your faith
111023	
111024	
111025	is ever greater.
111026	
111027	and the love
111028	one of you
111029	of each
111030	all
111031	
111032	for you,
111033	for one another
111034	As a result
111035	
111036	
111037	we ourselves boast about you
111038	
111039	
111040	in
111041

111056	
111057	
111058	and afflictions
111059	
111060	you are enduring.
111061	This is evidence
111062	
111063	righteous
111064	judgment,
111065	
111066	of God’s
111067	to
111068	
111069	make you
111070

111074	of God,
111075	for
111076	which
111077	
111078	in fact you are suffering.
111079	For
111080	it is right
111081	for
111082	God
111083	to repay
111084	
111085	those who afflict you,
111086	
111087	with affliction
111088

111091	and to you who are being afflicted

111093	together with us
111094	
111095	
111096	
111097	is revealed
111098	
111099	when the Lord
111100	Jesus

111106	
111107	With
111108	fire
111109	flaming
111110	he will mete out
111111	punishment
111112	
111113	on those who do not
111114	know
111115	God
111116	
111117	
111118	and do not
111119	obey
111120	
111121	the gospel
111122	
111123	of our Lord
111124	
111125	Jesus.
111126	They
111127	will undergo
111128	the penalty
111129	destruction,
111130	of eternal
111131	away from
111132	the presence
111133	
111134	of the Lord
111135	
111136	and from
111137	
111138	the glory
111139	
111140	of his strength,
111141	
111142	when
111143	he comes
111144	to be glorified
111145	among
111146	
111147	his saints
111148	
111149	
111150	and admired
111151	on
111152	all
111153	
111154	who have believed –
111155	
111156	and you did in fact believe
111157	
111158	our testimony.
111159	
111160	
111161	
111162	among
111163	
111164	day
111165	that
111166	
111167	And in this regard
111168	
111169	we pray
111170	always,
111171	for you
111172	
111173	that
111174	
111175	will make you
111176	
111177	worthy of his calling

111182	and fulfill
111183	your every
111184	desire

111186	
111187	and every work
111188	of faith,
111189	by
111190	his power
111191	that
111192	may be glorified
111193	
111194	the name
111195	
111196	of our Lord
111197	
111198	Jesus
111199	in you,
111200	
111201	
111202	
111203	and you in him,
111204	
111205	according to
111206	
111207	the grace
111208	
111209	of our God
111210	
111211	
111212	and the Lord
111213	Jesus
111214	Christ.
111215	we ask you,
111216	Now
111217	
111218	brothers and sisters,
111219	regarding
111220	
111221	the arrival
111222	
111223	of our Lord
111224	
111225	Jesus
111226	Christ
111227	
111228	
111229	and our being gathered
111230	to be with him,
111231	
111232	
111233	
111234	not
111235	to be easily
111236	shaken
111237	
111238	from
111239	
111240	your composure
111241	or
111242	disturbed
111243	
111244	by
111245	any kind of spirit
111246	or
111247	
111248	message
111249	or
111250	
111251	letter
111252	allegedly
111253	from us,
111254	
111255	to the effect
111256	
111257	is already here.
111258	
111259	that the day
111260	
111261	of the Lord
111262	Let no
111263	one
111264	
111265	deceive you
111266	in
111267	any
111268	way.
111269	
111270	
111271	For that day will not
111272	arrive
111273	
111274	until the rebellion
111275	
111276	
111277	is revealed,
111278	
111279	comes and the man
111280	
111281	of lawlessness
111282	
111283	the son
111284	
111285	of destruction.
111286	
111287	He opposes
111288	
111289	and exalts
111290	himself above
111291	every
111292	so-called
111293	god
111294	or
111295	object of worship,
111296	and as a result
111297	his seat
111298	in
111299	
111300	temple,
111301	
111302	God’s
111303	he takes
111304	displaying
111305	himself
111306	
111307	as
111308	God.
111309	Surely
111310	you recall
111311	that
111312	still
111313	while I was
111314	with you.
111315	
111316	these things
111317	I used to tell you
111318	
111319	
111320	And so
111321	
111322	what holds
111323	you know
111324	him back, so that
111325	
111326	he will be revealed
111327	
111328	in
111329	
111330	his own
111331	time.
111332	
111333	For
111334	the hidden power
111335	is already
111336	at work.
111337	
111338	of lawlessness
111339	However,
111340	
111341	the one who holds
111342	
111343	him back will do so until
111344	out of
111345	the way,
111346	he is taken
111347	
111348	and then
111349	will be revealed,
111350	
111351	the lawless one
111352	whom
111353	
111354	the Lord
111355	
111356	will destroy
111357	
111358	by the breath
111359	
111360	of his mouth
111361	
111362	
111363	and wipe out
111364	
111365	by the manifestation
111366	
111367	of his arrival.
111368	
111369	of the lawless one
111370	will be
111371	
111372	The arrival
111373	by
111374	working
111375	
111376	Satan’s
111377	with
111378	all kinds
111379	of miracles
111380	
111381	and signs
111382	
111383	wonders,
111384	and false
111385	
111386	and with
111387	every kind
111388	deception
111389	of evil
111390	
111391	directed against those who are perishing,
111392	because
111393	
111394	
111395	place in their hearts
111396	
111397	for the truth
111398	no
111399	they found
111400	so as to
111401	
111402	be saved.
111403	
111404	
111405	
111406	Consequently
111407	sends on them
111408	
111409	
111410	God
111411	influence
111412	a deluding
111413	so that
111414	
111415	they will believe
111416	
111417	
111418	what is false.
111419	And so
111420	will be condemned.
111421	all
111422	
111423	of them who have not
111424	believed
111425	
111426	the truth
111427	but
111428	have delighted
111429	
111430	in evil
111431	
111432	But
111433	we ought
111434	to thank
111435	
111436	God
111437	always
111438	for you,
111439	
111440	brothers and sisters
111441	loved
111442	by
111443	the Lord,
111444	
111445	chose you
111446	
111447	
111448	because God
111449	from the beginning
111450	for
111451	salvation
111452	through
111453	sanctification
111454	by the Spirit
111455	
111456	and faith
111457	in the truth.
111458	to
111459	this salvation
111460	
111461	He called you
111462	
111463	through
111464	
111465	our gospel,
111466	
111467	so that
111468	you may possess
111469	the glory
111470	
111471	of our Lord
111472	
111473	Jesus
111474	Christ.
111475	
111476	Therefore,
111477	brothers and sisters,
111478	stand firm
111479	
111480	and hold on
111481	
111482	to the traditions
111483	that
111484	we taught
111485	you, whether
111486	by
111487	speech
111488	or
111489	by
111490	letter.
111491	
111492	
111493	Now
111494	
111495	may our Lord
111496	
111497	Jesus
111498	Christ himself
111499	
111500	
111501	and God
111502	
111503	our Father,
111504	
111505	
111506	who loved us
111507	
111508	
111509	gave
111510	comfort
111511	us eternal
111512	
111513	hope,
111514	and good
111515	and by
111516	grace
111517	encourage
111518	
111519	
111520	your hearts
111521	
111522	and strengthen
111523	you in
111524	every
111525	you do
111526	
111527	or say.
111528	good thing
111529	
111530	Finally,
111531	pray
111532	brothers and sisters,
111533	for us,
111534	
111535	that
111536	
111537	message
111538	
111539	the Lord’s
111540	may spread quickly
111541	
111542	and be honored
111543	as
111544	
111545	in fact it was among you,
111546	
111547	
111548	and that
111549	we may be delivered
111550	from
111551	
111552	perverse
111553	
111554	and evil
111555	people.
111556	not
111557	For
111558	all
111559	
111560	have faith.
111561	faithful,
111562	But
111563	is
111564	
111565	the Lord
111566	and he
111567	will strengthen
111568	
111569	
111570	you and protect
111571	you from
111572	
111573	the evil one.
111574	we are confident
111575	And
111576	in
111577	the Lord
111578	about you
111579	
111580	
111581	what
111582	we are commanding.
111583	
111584	that you are both doing –
111585	
111586	and will do –
111587	
111588	Now
111589	may the Lord
111590	direct
111591	
111592	
111593	your hearts
111594	toward
111595	
111596	the love
111597	
111598	of God
111599	
111600	
111601	
111602	and the endurance
111603	
111604	of Christ.
111605	we command you,
111606	But
111607	
111608	brothers and sisters,
111609	in
111610	the name
111611	
111612	of our Lord
111613	
111614	Jesus
111615	Christ,
111616	to keep away
111617	
111618	from
111619	any
111620	brother
111621	an undisciplined
111622	who lives
111623	
111624	life and not
111625	according to
111626	
111627	the tradition
111628	
111629	they received
111630	from us.
111631	
111632	
111633	For
111634	you know
111635	yourselves how
111636	you must
111637	imitate us,
111638	
111639	
111640	because we did not
111641	behave without discipline
111642	among you,
111643	
111644	and
111645	without paying.
111646	food
111647	we did not eat
111648	
111649	anyone’s
111650	Instead,
111651	in
111652	toil
111653	
111654	and drudgery
111655	night
111656	
111657	and day
111658	we worked
111659	in order
111660	
111661	not
111662	to burden
111663	any of you.
111664	
111665	It was not
111666	
111667	because we do not
111668	have
111669	that right,
111670	but
111671	to
111672	ourselves
111673	as an example for you
111674	give
111675	
111676	to
111677	
111678	imitate.
111679	
111680	
111681	For
111682	even when
111683	we were
111684	with you,
111685	
111686	
111687	we used to give you
111688	
111689	
111690	this command: “If
111691	anyone
111692	is not
111693	willing
111694	to work,
111695	neither
111696	should he eat.”
111697	we hear
111698	For
111699	that some
111700	you are living
111701	among
111702	
111703	an undisciplined life,
111704	not
111705	doing
111706	their own work but
111707	meddling in the work of others.
111708	
111709	Now
111710	such people
111711	we command
111712	
111713	and urge
111714	in
111715	the Lord
111716	Jesus
111717	Christ
111718	to
111719	
111720	quietly
111721	work
111722	
111723	and so provide their own
111724	food
111725	to eat.
111726	
111727	But you,
111728	brothers and sisters,
111729	do not
111730	grow weary
111731	in doing what is right.
111732	if
111733	But
111734	anyone
111735	does not
111736	obey
111737	
111738	our message
111739	
111740	through
111741	
111742	this letter,
111743	
111744	take note of him
111745	and do not
111746	associate closely with him,
111747	
111748	so that
111749	he may be ashamed.
111750	
111751	Yet do not
111752	him as
111753	an enemy,
111754	regard
111755	but
111756	admonish
111757	him as
111758	a brother.
111759	
111760	Now
111761	
111762	may the Lord
111763	
111764	of peace himself
111765	give you
111766	
111767	
111768	peace
111769	at
111770	all times
111771	and in
111772	every
111773	way.
111774	
111775	The Lord
111776	be with you
111777	all.
111778	
111779	
111780	this greeting
111781	
111782	with my own
111783	hand,
111784	I, Paul,
111785	which
111786	is
111787	
111788	I write in
111789	every
111790	letter.
111791	how
111792	write
111793	
111794	The grace
111795	
111796	of our Lord
111797	
111798	Jesus
111799	Christ
111800	be with you
111801	all.
111802	
111803	From Paul,
111804	an apostle
111805	of Christ
111806	Jesus
111807	by
111808	the command
111809	of God
111810	our Savior
111811	
111812	
111813	and of Christ
111814	Jesus
111815	
111816	our hope,
111817	
111818	to Timothy,
111819	my genuine
111820	child
111821	in
111822	the faith.
111823	Grace,
111824	mercy,
111825	and peace
111826	from
111827	God
111828	the Father
111829	
111830	and Christ
111831	Jesus
111832	
111833	our Lord!
111834	
111835	As
111836	I urged
111837	
111838	stay on
111839	in
111840	Ephesus
111841	you when I was leaving
111842	for
111843	Macedonia,
111844	to
111845	instruct
111846	certain people
111847	not
111848	to spread false teachings,
111849	nor
111850	to occupy
111851	themselves with myths
111852	
111853	genealogies.
111854	and interminable
111855	Such things
111856	
111857	promote
111858	useless speculations rather
111859	than
111860	redemptive plan
111861	God’s
111862	
111863	that operates by
111864	faith.
111865	
111866	But
111867	the aim
111868	
111869	of our instruction
111870	is
111871	love
111872	that comes from
111873	a pure
111874	heart,
111875	
111876	conscience,
111877	a good
111878	
111879	faith.
111880	and a sincere
111881	
111882	Some
111883	have strayed
111884	from these and turned away
111885	to
111886	empty discussion.
111887	They want
111888	to be
111889	teachers of the law,
111890	but they do not
111891	understand
111892	
111893	what
111894	they are saying
111895	or
111896	
111897	the things
111898	they insist on so confidently.
111899	we know
111900	But
111901	
111902	is good
111903	
111904	that the law
111905	if
111906	someone
111907	
111908	legitimately,
111909	uses it
111910	realizing
111911	
111912	
111913	for a righteous person,
111914	that law
111915	is not
111916	intended
111917	for lawless
111918	but
111919	
111920	and rebellious people,
111921	for the ungodly
111922	
111923	and sinners,
111924	for the unholy
111925	
111926	and profane,
111927	for those who kill their fathers
111928	
111929	or mothers,
111930	for murderers,
111931	sexually immoral people,
111932	practicing homosexuals,
111933	kidnappers,
111934	liars,
111935	perjurers –
111936	
111937	
111938	in fact, for any
111939	
111940	
111941	to sound
111942	teaching.
111943	who live contrary
111944	This accords with
111945	
111946	gospel
111947	
111948	the glorious
111949	
111950	of the blessed
111951	God
111952	that
111953	was entrusted to me.
111954	
111955	grateful
111956	I am
111957	
111958	to the one who has strengthened me,
111959	
111960	Christ
111961	Jesus
111962	
111963	our Lord,
111964	
111965	
111966	faithful
111967	
111968	because he considered me
111969	in putting
111970	me into
111971	ministry,
111972	
111973	formerly
111974	even though I was
111975	a blasphemer
111976	
111977	and a persecutor,
111978	
111979	and an arrogant
111980	man. But
111981	I was treated with mercy
111982	
111983	ignorantly
111984	because I acted
111985	in
111986	unbelief,
111987	was abundant,
111988	and
111989	
111990	grace
111991	
111992	our Lord’s
111993	
111994	bringing
111995	faith
111996	
111997	and love
111998	
111999	in
112000	Christ
112001	Jesus.
112002	is trustworthy
112003	
112004	This saying
112005	
112006	full
112007	acceptance:
112008	and deserves
112009	
112010	“Christ
112011	Jesus
112012	came
112013	into
112014	
112015	the world
112016	sinners” –
112017	to save
112018	of them!
112019	the worst
112020	and I am
112021	
112022	But
112023	
112024	here is why
112025	I was treated with mercy:
112026	so that
112027	in me
112028	
112029	as the worst,
112030	could demonstrate
112031	Christ
112032	Jesus
112033	
112034	his utmost
112035	patience,
112036	as
112037	an example
112038	
112039	for those who are going to
112040	believe
112041	in him
112042	
112043	for
112044	life.
112045	eternal
112046	
112047	Now
112048	king,
112049	
112050	to the eternal
112051	immortal,
112052	invisible,
112053	the only
112054	God,
112055	be honor
112056	
112057	and glory
112058	
112059	
112060	forever
112061	
112062	and ever!
112063	Amen.
112064	this charge
112065	
112066	I put
112067	before you,
112068	
112069	my child,
112070	Timothy
112071	in keeping with
112072	
112073	once spoken
112074	about you,
112075	
112076	the prophecies
112077	in order that
112078	you may fight
112079	with
112080	such encouragement
112081	
112082	the good
112083	fight.
112084	To do this you must hold firmly
112085	to faith
112086	
112087	and a good
112088	conscience,
112089	which
112090	some
112091	have rejected
112092	in regard to
112093	
112094	the faith.
112095	and so have suffered shipwreck
112096	Among these
112097	are
112098	Hymenaeus
112099	
112100	and Alexander,
112101	whom
112102	I handed over
112103	
112104	to Satan
112105	to
112106	be taught
112107	not
112108	to blaspheme.
112109	I urge
112110	then,
112111	First
112112	of all,
112113	be offered
112114	that requests,
112115	prayers,
112116	intercessions,
112117	and thanks
112118	on behalf of
112119	all
112120	people,
112121	even for
112122	kings
112123	
112124	and all
112125	
112126	in
112127	authority,
112128	who are
112129	that
112130	a peaceful
112131	
112132	and quiet
112133	life
112134	we may lead
112135	in
112136	all
112137	godliness
112138	
112139	and dignity.
112140	
112141	Such prayer for all is good
112142	
112143	and welcomed
112144	before
112145	
112146	our Savior,
112147	
112148	God
112149	since he
112150	all
112151	people
112152	wants
112153	to be saved
112154	
112155	to
112156	a knowledge
112157	of the truth.
112158	and to come
112159	there is one
112160	For
112161	God
112162	and one
112163	
112164	intermediary
112165	between God
112166	
112167	and humanity,
112168	himself human,
112169	Christ
112170	Jesus,
112171	
112172	who gave
112173	himself
112174	as a ransom
112175	for
112176	all,
112177	
112178	revealing
112179	appointed time.
112180	God’s purpose at his
112181	For
112182	this
112183	I was appointed
112184	
112185	a preacher
112186	
112187	and apostle –
112188	the truth;
112189	I am telling
112190	I am not
112191	lying –
112192	and a teacher
112193	of the Gentiles
112194	in
112195	faith
112196	
112197	and truth.
112198	I want
112199	So
112200	to pray,
112201	
112202	the men
112203	in
112204	every
112205	place

112209	without
112210	anger
112211	
112212	or dispute.
112213	Likewise
112214	
112215	the women
112216	are to dress in
112217	suitable
112218	apparel,

112222	and self-control.

112231	pearls
112232	or
112233	clothing,
112234	expensive
112235	but
112236	
112237	as is proper
112238	for women
112239	who profess
112240	reverence for God.
112241	with
112242	deeds,
112243	good
112244	A woman

112249	all
112250	submissiveness.
112251	to teach
112252	But
112253	a woman
112254	I do not
112255	allow
112256	or
112257	exercise authority
112258	over a man.

112354	
112355	
112356	or he may become arrogant
112357	into
112358	the punishment
112359	and fall
112360	
112361	that the devil will exact.
112362	he must
112363	And
112364	
112365	thought
112366	be well
112367	
112368	of by
112369	
112370	those outside
112371	the faith, so that
112372	he may not
112373	into
112374	disgrace
112375	fall
112376	
112377	trap.
112378	
112379	and be caught by the devil’s
112380	Deacons
112381	likewise
112382	must be dignified,
112383	not
112384	two-faced,
112385	not
112386	drinking,
112387	to excessive
112388	given
112389	not
112390	greedy for gain,
112391	holding
112392	
112393	to the mystery
112394	
112395	of the faith
112396	with
112397	a clear
112398	conscience.
112399	
112400	
112401	And
112402	these also must be tested
112403	first
112404	and then
112405	let them serve as deacons
112406	found blameless.
112407	if they are
112408	also their wives
112409	Likewise
112410	must be dignified,
112411	not
112412	slanderous,
112413	temperate,
112414	faithful
112415	in
112416	every respect.
112417	Deacons
112418	must be

112420	wife
112421	husbands
112422	of their children
112423	and good
112424	managers
112425	
112426	
112427	and their own

112429	
112430	For
112431	well
112432	those who have served
112433	standing
112434	for themselves
112435	a good
112436	as deacons gain
112437	
112438	and great
112439	boldness
112440	in
112441	the faith
112442	
112443	that is in
112444	Christ
112445	Jesus.
112446	
112447	
112448	but I am writing these instructions to you
112449	I hope
112450	to come
112451	to you
112452	
112453	
112454	soon,
112455	in case
112456	
112457	I am delayed,
112458	to
112459	let you know
112460	how
112461	people ought
112462	themselves in
112463	the household
112464	of God,
112465	to conduct
112466	because
112467	it is
112468	the church
112469	God,
112470	of the living
112471	the support
112472	
112473	and bulwark
112474	
112475	of the truth.
112476	
112477	And we all agree,
112478	amazing
112479	contains
112480	
112481	
112482	our religion
112483	revelation:
112484	He
112485	was revealed
112486	in
112487	the flesh,
112488	vindicated
112489	by
112490	the Spirit,
112491	seen
112492	by angels,
112493	proclaimed
112494	among
112495	Gentiles,
112496	believed on
112497	in
112498	the world,
112499	taken up
112500	in
112501	glory.
112502	
112503	Now
112504	the Spirit
112505	explicitly
112506	says
112507	
112508	that in
112509	the later
112510	times
112511	will desert
112512	some
112513	
112514	the faith
112515	and occupy
112516	spirits
112517	themselves with deceiving
112518	
112519	teachings,
112520	and demonic
112521	influenced by
112522	the hypocrisy
112523	of liars
112524	are seared.
112525	
112526	whose
112527	consciences
112528	They will prohibit
112529	marriage
112530	and require abstinence
112531	from foods
112532	that
112533	
112534	God
112535	created
112536	to
112537	be received
112538	with
112539	thanksgiving
112540	
112541	by those who believe
112542	
112543	and know
112544	
112545	the truth.
112546	
112547	For every
112548	creation
112549	of God
112550	is good
112551	
112552	and no
112553	food is to be rejected
112554	with
112555	thanksgiving.
112556	if it is received
112557	it is sanctified
112558	For
112559	by
112560	word
112561	God’s
112562	
112563	and by prayer.
112564	
112565	By pointing out
112566	
112567	such things to the brothers and sisters,

112576	
112577	of the faith
112578	
112579	
112580	and of the good
112581	teaching
112582	that
112583	you have followed.

113045	
113046	not
113047	and the ones that are
113048	remain hidden.
113049	
113050	cannot
113051	Those
113052	who are
113053	under
113054	the yoke
113055	as slaves
113056	
113057	their own
113058	masters
113059	of full
113060	respect.
113061	as deserving
113062	must regard
113063	
113064	This will prevent
113065	
113066	the name
113067	
113068	of God
113069	
113070	
113071	and Christian teaching
113072	from being discredited.
113073	
113074	But
113075	believing
113076	those who have
113077	masters
113078	must not
113079	show
113080	
113081	brothers.
113082	them less respect because they are
113083	Instead
113084	all the more,
113085	they are to serve
113086	
113087	believers
113088	are
113089	
113090	and dearly loved.
113091	
113092	
113093	from their service
113094	because those who benefit
113095	
113096	Teach
113097	
113098	them and exhort them about these things.
113099	If
113100	someone
113101	spreads false teachings
113102	
113103	and does not
113104	agree with
113105	sound
113106	words
113107	
113108	
113109	(that is, those of our Lord
113110	
113111	Jesus
113112	Christ)
113113	
113114	
113115	that accords with
113116	godliness,
113117	and with the teaching
113118	he is conceited
113119	nothing,
113120	and understands
113121	but
113122	has an unhealthy interest
113123	in
113124	controversies
113125	
113126	and verbal disputes.
113127	
113128	This
113129	gives rise
113130	to envy,
113131	dissension,
113132	slanders,
113133	suspicions,
113134	evil
113135	and constant bickering
113136	corrupted
113137	by people
113138	
113139	in their minds
113140	
113141	and deprived
113142	
113143	of the truth,
113144	who suppose
113145	a way of making a profit.
113146	is
113147	
113148	that godliness
113149	brings
113150	Now
113151	profit.
113152	great
113153	
113154	godliness
113155	combined with
113156	contentment
113157	nothing
113158	For
113159	we have brought
113160	into
113161	this
113162	world
113163	and so
113164	we cannot
113165	take
113166	a single thing out either.
113167	
113168	if we have
113169	But
113170	food
113171	
113172	and shelter,
113173	
113174	we will be satisfied with that.
113175	
113176	however,
113177	Those who long
113178	to be rich,
113179	stumble
113180	into
113181	temptation
113182	
113183	and a trap
113184	
113185	desires
113186	and many
113187	senseless
113188	
113189	and harmful
113190	that
113191	plunge
113192	
113193	people
113194	into
113195	ruin
113196	
113197	and destruction.
113198	the root
113199	For
113200	of all
113201	
113202	evils.
113203	is
113204	
113205	the love of money
113206	
113207	Some people
113208	in reaching for
113209	it have strayed
113210	from
113211	
113212	the faith
113213	
113214	themselves
113215	and stabbed
113216	pains.
113217	with many
113218	
113219	But you,
113220	
113221	as a person
113222	dedicated to God,
113223	
113224	keep away
113225	pursue
113226	from all that. Instead
113227	righteousness,
113228	godliness,
113229	faithfulness,
113230	love,
113231	endurance, and gentleness.
113232	
113233	Compete
113234	
113235	well
113236	
113237	
113238	for the faith
113239	and lay hold
113240	
113241	of that eternal
113242	life
113243	for
113244	
113245	you were called
113246	
113247	and made
113248	
113249	your good
113250	confession
113251	for in the presence of
113252	many
113253	witnesses.
113254	I charge
113255	
113256	you before
113257	
113258	God
113259	
113260	who gives life
113261	
113262	to all things
113263	
113264	and Christ
113265	Jesus
113266	
113267	who made
113268	before
113269	Pontius
113270	Pilate,
113271	
113272	his good
113273	confession
113274	to obey
113275	
113276	
113277	this command
113278	without fault
113279	or failure
113280	until
113281	
113282	the appearing
113283	
113284	of our Lord
113285	
113286	Jesus
113287	Christ
113288	– whose appearing
113289	time.
113290	at the right
113291	will reveal

113297	
113298	the King

113300	of kings
113301	
113302	and Lord
113303	
113304	of lords,
113305	
113306	He alone
113307	possesses
113308	immortality
113309	light,
113310	and lives
113311	in unapproachable
113312	whom
113313	has ever seen
113314	no
113315	human
113316	or

113318	is able

113334	or
113335	to set
113336	their hope on
113337	riches,
113338	which are uncertain,
113339	but
113340	on
113341	God
113342	
113343	provides us
113344	
113345	with all things
113346	who richly

113353	good
113354	generous givers,
113355	to be
113356	sharing with others.
113357	In this way they will save up a treasure

113427	whom
113428	I have served
113429	as

113431	with
113432	a clear
113433	conscience
113434	as
113435	constantly
113436	I do
113437	
113438	
113439	
113440	did, when I remember you

113467	first
113468	is in you.
113469	
113470	your grandmother

113472	Lois

113474	
113475	and in your mother
113476	
113477	Eunice,
113478	I am sure
113479	and
113480	
113481	
113482	
113483	
113484	Because of
113485	this
113486	
113487	I remind
113488	
113489	you to rekindle
113490	
113491	God’s gift
113492	
113493	
113494	that
113495	you possess
113496	
113497	
113498	through
113499	
113500	the laying on
113501	
113502	of my hands.
113503	
113504	did not
113505	For
113506	give us
113507	
113508	
113509	God
113510	a Spirit
113511	of fear
113512	but
113513	of power
113514	
113515	and love
113516	
113517	and self-control.
113518	do not
113519	So
113520	be ashamed
113521	
113522	of the testimony
113523	
113524	about our Lord
113525	
113526	or of me,
113527	
113528	
113529	a prisoner
113530	
113531	for his sake, but
113532	accept your share of suffering
113533	
113534	for the gospel.
113535	by
113536	power
113537	God’s

113539	He is the one who saved us
113540	
113541	
113542	and called
113543	calling,
113544	us with a holy
113545	not
113546	based on
113547	
113548	our works
113549	
113550	but
113551	on
113552	his own
113553	purpose
113554	
113555	and grace,
113556	
113557	granted to us
113558	
113559	in
113560	Christ
113561	Jesus
113562	before
113563	time
113564	began,
113565	made visible
113566	but
113567	now
113568	through

113570	the appearing
113571	
113572	of our Savior
113573	
113574	Christ
113575	Jesus.
113576	He has broken
113577	
113578	
113579	the power of death
113580	and brought
113581	
113582	life
113583	
113584	and immortality
113585	to light through
113586	
113587	the gospel!
113588	For
113589	this gospel
113590	I was appointed
113591	
113592	a preacher
113593	
113594	and apostle
113595	
113596	and teacher.
113597	Because of
113598	this,
113599	
113600	
113601	
113602	in fact, I suffer
113603	as I do. But
113604	I am not
113605	ashamed,
113606	I know
113607	because

113617	
113618	what has been entrusted to me

113675	refreshed me
113676	
113677	
113678	of my imprisonment.
113679	
113680	and was not
113681	ashamed
113682	But
113683	when he arrived
113684	in
113685	Rome,
113686	he eagerly
113687	searched for me
113688	
113689	
113690	and found me.

113791	raised
113792	from
113793	the dead,

113836	This saying
113837	If
113838	
113839	we died with
113840	
113841	him, we will also live with him.
113842	If
113843	we endure,
113844	
113845	we will also reign with
113846	him. If
113847	we deny
113848	him, he

113851	If

113869	
113870	This is of no

113872	
113873	it just brings ruin on

114246	You, however,

114359	to hear new things.
114360

114699	I left you
114700	
114701	in
114702	Crete
114703	was to

114706	set in order
114707	
114708	and to appoint
114709	in every
114710	town,
114711	elders
114712	as
114713	
114714	
114715	I directed you.
114716	
114717	
114718	An elder must be
114719	blameless,
114720	of one
114721	wife,
114722	the husband
114723	children
114724	
114725	with faithful
114726	who cannot
114727	
114728	be charged
114729	with dissipation
114730	or
114731	rebellion.
114732	must
114733	For
114734	
114735	the overseer
114736	blameless
114737	be
114738	as
114739	one entrusted with God’s
114740	work,
114741	not
114742	arrogant,
114743	not
114744	prone to anger,
114745	not
114746	a drunkard,
114747	not
114748	violent,
114749	not
114750	greedy for gain.
114751	Instead
114752	he must be hospitable,
114753	devoted to what is good,
114754	sensible,
114755	upright,
114756	devout,
114757	and self-controlled.
114758	He must hold firmly
114759	
114760	as
114761	
114762	it has been taught,
114763	to the faithful
114764	message
114765	so that
114766	able
114767	he will be
114768	
114769	to give exhortation
114770	in
114771	
114772	teaching
114773	
114774	such healthy
114775	
114776	
114777	those who speak against it.
114778	and correct
114779	there are
114780	For
114781	many
114782	
114783	rebellious people,
114784	idle talkers,
114785	
114786	and deceivers,
114787	especially
114788	
114789	those with
114790	
114791	Jewish connections,
114792	who
114793	must
114794	be silenced
114795	because they
114796	whole
114797	families
114798	mislead
114799	by teaching
114800	what
114801	not to be taught.
114802	ought
114803	for dishonest
114804	gain
114805	
114806	said,
114807	A certain one
114808	of them,
114809	
114810	in fact, one of their own
114811	
114812	prophets,
114813	“Cretans
114814	are always
114815	liars,
114816	evil
114817	beasts,
114818	
114819	lazy gluttons.”
114820	
114821	Such testimony
114822	
114823	is
114824	true.
114825	For
114826	this
114827	reason
114828	rebuke them
114829	
114830	sharply
114831	that
114832	they may be healthy
114833	in
114834	
114835	the faith
114836	and not
114837	pay attention to
114838	Jewish
114839	myths
114840	
114841	and commands
114842	of people
114843	who reject
114844	
114845	the truth.
114846	All
114847	is pure
114848	
114849	to those who are pure.
114850	
114851	But
114852	to those who are corrupt
114853

114855	nothing
114856	is pure,
114857	but
114858	are corrupted.

114868	to know

114870	but
114871	with their deeds
114872	they deny
114873	detestable,
114874	him, since they are
114875	
114876	disobedient,

114879	any
114880	deed.
114881	good
114882	and unfit
114883	
114884	But as for you,

115399	quite a lot
115400	in

115402	of confidence
115403	although I have
115404	and could command
115405	
115406	
115407	you to do what is proper,
115408	to you on the basis of
115409	
115410	love –
115411	I would rather
115412	appeal
115413	
115414	
115415	
115416	I, Paul,
115417	an old man
115418	even now
115419	and
115420	
115421	a prisoner
115422	for the sake of Christ
115423	Jesus –
115424	I am appealing to you
115425	
115426	concerning
115427	
115428	my
115429	child,
115430	whose
115431	spiritual father
115432	I have become during
115433	
115434	my imprisonment,
115435	that is, Onesimus,
115436	
115437	who was formerly
115438	
115439	useless to you,
115440	is now
115441	but
115442	
115443	
115444	
115445	
115446	useful to you and me.
115447	
115448	I have sent him
115449	
115450	
115451	
115452	(who is
115453	
115454	my
115455	very heart) back to you.
115456	him
115457	
115458	I wanted
115459	with
115460	me
115461	to keep
115462	so that
115463	in
115464	your place
115465	
115466	he could serve me
115467	during
115468	
115469	my imprisonment
115470	
115471	for the sake of the gospel.
115472	without
115473	However,
115474	
115475	your
115476	consent
115477	I did not
115478	want
115479	to do
115480	anything, so that
115481	would not
115482	
115483	be out of
115484	compulsion,
115485	
115486	your good deed
115487	
115488	
115489	but
115490	from
115491	your own willingness.
115492	perhaps
115493	For
115494	it was for
115495	
115496	this reason that he was separated
115497	from you for
115498	a little while,
115499	so that
115500	back eternally,
115501	
115502	you would have him
115503	no longer
115504	as
115505	a slave,
115506	but
115507	more than
115508	a slave,
115509	brother.
115510	as a dear
115511	He is especially so to me,
115512	
115513	even
115514	and
115515	more so to you now,
115516	
115517	
115518	and in
115519	both humanly speaking
115520	
115521	
115522	the Lord.
115523	if
115524	Therefore
115525	
115526	you regard me
115527	as a partner,
115528	accept him
115529	
115530	as you would me.
115531	
115532	if
115533	Now
115534	of anything
115535	he has defrauded you
115536	
115537	or
115538	
115539	
115540	
115541	owes you anything, charge what he owes to me.
115542	
115543	I, Paul,
115544	have written this letter
115545	with
115546	my own
115547	hand:
115548	
115549	will repay
115550	
115551	it. I could
115552	I
115553	
115554	
115555	
115556	your very self.
115557	
115558	also mention that you owe me
115559	Yes,
115560	brother, let me
115561	
115562	
115563	have some benefit from you
115564	in
115565	the Lord.
115566	Refresh
115567	
115568	
115569	my heart
115570	in
115571	Christ.
115572	Since I was confident that you
115573	
115574	would obey,
115575	
115576	I wrote to you,
115577	
115578	because I knew
115579	
115580	
115581	even more than
115582	what
115583	I am asking you to do.
115584	that you would do
115585	At the same time
115586	
115587	
115588	also, prepare a place for me
115589	
115590	to stay,
115591	I hope
115592	for
115593	
115594	that through
115595	
115596	your prayers
115597	
115598	I will be given back to you.
115599	
115600	greets you.
115601	
115602	Epaphras,
115603	
115604	
115605	
115606	my fellow prisoner in
115607	Christ
115608	Jesus,
115609	Mark,
115610	Aristarchus,
115611	Demas,
115612	and Luke,
115613	
115614	my colaborers, greet you too.
115615	
115616	
115617	May the grace
115618	
115619	of the Lord
115620	Jesus
115621	Christ
115622	be with
115623	
115624	your spirit.
115625	
115626	in various portions
115627	
115628	and in various ways
115629	long ago
115630	
115631	After God
115632	spoke
115633	
115634	to our ancestors
115635	through
115636	
115637	the prophets,
115638	in
115639	these last
115640	
115641	days
115642	
115643	he has spoken to us
115644	
115645	
115646	in a son,
115647	whom
115648	he appointed
115649	heir
115650	of all things,
115651	and through
115652	whom
115653	
115654	he created
115655	
115656	the world.
115657	The Son
115658	is
115659	the radiance
115660	
115661	of his glory
115662	
115663	and the representation
115664	
115665	of his essence,
115666	
115667	he sustains
115668	and
115669	
115670	all things
115671	
115672	word,
115673	
115674	by his powerful
115675	
115676	cleansing
115677	
115678	for sins,
115679	and so when he had accomplished
115680	he sat down
115681	at
115682	the right hand
115683	
115684	of the Majesty
115685	on
115686	high.
115687	so far
115688	better
115689	Thus he became
115690	
115691	than the angels
115692	as
115693	superior
115694	to theirs.
115695	
115696	he has inherited
115697	a name
115698	to which
115699	For
115700	say,
115701	did God ever
115702	
115703	of the angels
115704	my son!
115705	
115706	“You are
115707	
115708	
115709	Today
115710	I have fathered you”?
115711	
115712	
115713	And in another
115714	
115715	place he says, “I will be
115716	
115717	
115718	his father
115719	
115720	
115721	and he will be
115722	
115723	
115724	my son.”
115725	when
115726	But
115727	he again
115728	brings
115729	
115730	his firstborn
115731	into
115732	
115733	the world,
115734	he says,
115735	
115736	worship him!”
115737	
115738	“Let all
115739	the angels
115740	of God
115741	
115742	
115743	
115744	
115745	of the angels,
115746	And he says
115747	
115748	“He makes
115749	
115750	his angels
115751	
115752	winds

115758	a flame
115759	of
115760	but
115761

115763	
115764	“Your throne,

115767	O God,

115781	
115782	You have loved
115783	righteousness
115784	
115785	and hated
115786	lawlessness.
115787	
115788	So
115789	has anointed you

115791	
115792	God,

115830	a robe
115831	you will fold them
115832	
115833	up and like
115834	a garment
115835	
115836	they will be changed,
115837	
115838	but
115839	
115840	
115841	you are
115842	
115843	
115844	the same and your years
115845	
115846	will never
115847	run out.”
115848	to
115849	which
115850	But
115851	
115852	of the angels
115853	said,
115854	has he ever
115855	“Sit at
115856	
115857	my right hand
115858	
115859	until
115860	
115861	I make
115862	
115863	your enemies
115864	
115865	a footstool
115866	
115867	for your feet”?
115868	
115869	not
115870	all
115871	Are they
115872	ministering
115873	spirits,
115874	to
115875	serve
115876	sent out
115877	
115878	
115879	those who will
115880	inherit
115881	salvation?
115882	
115883	Therefore
115884	we must
115885	pay closer
115886	attention
115887	
115888	
115889	to what we have heard,
115890	so that we do not
115891	drift away.
115892	if
115893	For
115894	
115895	through
115896	angels
115897	spoken
115898	the message
115899	proved to be
115900	so firm
115901	
115902	that every
115903	violation
115904	
115905	or disobedience
115906	received
115907	its just
115908	penalty,
115909	how
115910	
115911	will we escape
115912	such a great
115913	if we neglect
115914	salvation?
115915	It
115916	was first
115917	
115918	communicated
115919	through
115920	
115921	the Lord
115922	by
115923	
115924	those who heard him,
115925	to us
115926	
115927	and was confirmed
115928	confirmed
115929	
115930	while God
115931	their witness with signs
115932	
115933	
115934	and wonders
115935	
115936	and various
115937	miracles
115938	
115939	Spirit
115940	and gifts of the Holy
115941	distributed
115942	according to
115943	
115944	
115945	his will.
115946	he did not
115947	For
115948	of angels.
115949	under the control
115950	put the
115951	world
115952	
115953	to come,
115954	about
115955	which
115956	we are speaking,
115957	testified
115958	Instead
115959	somewhere:
115960	someone
115961	
115962	“What
115963	is
115964	man
115965	
115966	that you think of him
115967	
115968	or
115969	the son
115970	of man
115971	
115972	that you care for him?
115973	
115974	You made him
115975	
115976	for a little while.
115977	
115978	lower than
115979	the angels
115980	with glory
115981	
115982	and honor.
115983	You crowned him
115984	
115985	all things
115986	You put
115987	under
115988	
115989	his control.”
115990	
115991	when
115992	he put
115993	For
115994	under
115995	his control,
115996	
115997	all things
115998	nothing
115999	he left
116000	
116001	outside of
116002	his control.
116003	At present
116004	we do not yet
116005	see
116006	
116007	
116008	all things
116009	under his control,
116010	
116011	but
116012	for a little while,
116013	
116014	lower than
116015	the angels
116016	who was made
116017	we see
116018	Jesus,
116019	because
116020	
116021	he suffered
116022	
116023	death,
116024	with glory
116025	
116026	and honor
116027	now crowned
116028	so that
116029	grace
116030	by God’s
116031	on behalf of
116032	everyone.
116033	he would experience
116034	death
116035	it was fitting for him,
116036	For
116037	
116038	for
116039	whom
116040	
116041	
116042	
116043	and through
116044	whom
116045	
116046	all things exist,
116047	many
116048	sons
116049	to
116050	glory,
116051	in bringing
116052	
116053	the pioneer
116054	
116055	of their salvation
116056	
116057	perfect through
116058	sufferings.
116059	to make
116060	
116061	indeed
116062	For
116063	he who makes holy
116064	
116065	
116066	and those being made holy
116067	
116068	have the same origin,
116069	all
116070	
116071	
116072	and so
116073	he is not
116074	ashamed
116075	brothers and sisters,
116076	
116077	to call them
116078	saying,
116079	“I will proclaim
116080	
116081	your name
116082	
116083	
116084	to my brothers;
116085	
116086	in
116087	the midst
116088	of the assembly
116089	I will praise you.”
116090	
116091	
116092	Again
116093	
116094	he says, “I will be
116095	confident
116096	in him,”
116097	
116098	
116099	and again,
116100	“Here
116101	
116102	
116103	
116104	I am, with the children
116105	
116106	
116107	has given me.”
116108	
116109	God
116110	since
116111	Therefore,
116112	
116113	the children
116114	share in
116115	and blood,
116116	
116117	flesh
116118	
116119	
116120	he likewise
116121	shared in
116122	
116123	
116124	their humanity, so that
116125	through
116126	
116127	death
116128	he could destroy
116129	
116130	
116131	the power
116132	the one who holds
116133	
116134	of death
116135	
116136	(that is,
116137	
116138	the devil),
116139	
116140	and set free
116141	
116142	those who
116143	by their fear
116144	of death.
116145	
116146	all
116147	
116148	their lives
116149	held in
116150	were
116151	slavery
116152	is not
116153	For
116154	surely
116155	for angels,
116156	his concern
116157	but
116158	descendants.
116159	for Abraham’s
116160	he is concerned
116161	Therefore
116162	he had
116163	in
116164	every respect,
116165	
116166	his brothers and sisters
116167	to be made like
116168	so that
116169	a merciful
116170	he could become
116171	
116172	and faithful
116173	high priest
116174	
116175	in things relating to
116176	
116177	God,
116178	to
116179	
116180	make atonement
116181	
116182	for the sins
116183	
116184	of the people.
116185	
116186	
116187	For since he himself
116188	suffered
116189	
116190	when he was tempted,
116191	he is able
116192	
116193	those who are tempted.
116194	to help
116195	Therefore,
116196	brothers and sisters,
116197	holy
116198	calling,
116199	in a heavenly
116200	partners
116201	take note
116202	
116203	the apostle
116204	
116205	and high priest
116206	
116207	whom we confess,
116208	
116209	of Jesus,
116210	faithful
116211	who is
116212	
116213	to the one who appointed him,
116214	
116215	as
116216	
116217	Moses
116218	was also in
116219	
116220	
116221	God’s house.
116222	
116223	greater
116224	For
116225	
116226	glory
116227	than
116228	Moses,
116229	he has come to deserve
116230	
116231	just as
116232	greater
116233	honor
116234	of a house deserves
116235	
116236	than the house itself!
116237	
116238	the builder
116239	
116240	every
116241	For
116242	house
116243	is built
116244	by
116245	someone,
116246	
116247	but
116248	of all things
116249	the builder
116250	is God.
116251	
116252	Now Moses
116253	
116254	was faithful
116255	in
116256	all
116257	
116258	God’s house
116259	
116260	as
116261	a servant,
116262	to
116263	testify
116264	
116265	to the things that would be spoken.
116266	Christ
116267	But
116268	is faithful as
116269	a son
116270	over
116271	
116272	God’s house.
116273	
116274	of his
116275	house,
116276	We are
116277	
116278	if
116279	
116280	to our confidence
116281	
116282	
116283	we take pride in.
116284	
116285	and the hope
116286	in fact we hold firmly
116287	Therefore,
116288	as
116289	says,
116290	
116291	Spirit
116292	
116293	the Holy
116294	that today
116295	“Oh,
116296	
116297	
116298	
116299	you would listen as he speaks!
116300	“Do not
116301	harden
116302	
116303	your hearts
116304	
116305	as
116306	in
116307	
116308	the rebellion,
116309	in
116310	
116311	the day
116312	
116313	of testing
116314	in
116315	
116316	the wilderness.
116317	“There
116318	tested
116319	
116320	your fathers
116321	
116322

116324	
116325	me and tried me, and they saw
116326	
116327	my works
116328	
116329	for forty
116330	years.
116331	“Therefore,
116332	I became provoked

116334	at that generation
116335

116337	said,
116338	are always
116339	wandering
116340	
116341	‘Their hearts
116342	
116343	and
116344	and they have not
116345	known
116346	
116347	my ways.’
116348	
116349	“As
116350	I swore
116351	in
116352	
116353	my anger,
116354	
116355	‘They will never

116359	my rest!’”
116360	
116361	See
116362	to it, brothers and sisters,
116363	that none
116364	of you has
116365	
116366	
116367	
116368	heart
116369	an evil,
116370	unbelieving
116371	
116372	
116373	that forsakes
116374	
116375	God.
116376	the living
116377	But
116378	exhort
116379	one another
116380	
116381	each
116382	day,
116383	as long as
116384	
116385	
116386	“Today,”
116387	it is called
116388	
116389	that
116390	you may become hardened
116391	none
116392	of
116393	
116394	deception.
116395	
116396	by sin’s
116397	partners
116398	For
116399	
116400	with Christ,
116401	we have become
116402	
116403	
116404	our initial
116405	
116406	confidence
116407	until
116408	the end.
116409	firm
116410	if in fact we hold
116411	As
116412	
116413	it says,
116414	that today
116415	“Oh,
116416	
116417	as he speaks!
116418	
116419	you would listen
116420	Do not
116421	harden
116422	
116423	your hearts
116424	
116425	as
116426	in
116427	
116428	the rebellion.”
116429	which ones
116430	For
116431	heard
116432	and rebelled?
116433	
116434	Was it not
116435	all
116436	
116437	who came out
116438	of
116439	Egypt
116440	under
116441	Moses’ leadership?
116442	against whom
116443	And
116444	was God provoked
116445	for forty
116446	years?
116447	Was it not
116448	
116449	those who sinned,
116450	whose
116451	
116452	dead bodies
116453	fell
116454	in
116455	
116456	the wilderness?
116457	to whom
116458	And
116459	did he swear
116460	they would never
116461	enter
116462	into
116463	
116464	his rest,
116465	
116466	
116467	except
116468	
116469	those who were disobedient?
116470	
116471	So we see
116472	
116473	not
116474	that they could
116475	enter
116476	because of
116477	unbelief.
116478	we must be wary
116479	Therefore
116480	that,
116481	remains open,
116482	while the promise
116483	of entering
116484	
116485	
116486	his rest
116487	
116488	you may seem
116489	none
116490	of
116491	
116492	to have come short of it.
116493	
116494	For
116495	we had
116496	good news proclaimed
116497	to us just as
116498	they did.
116499	But
116500	did them no
116501	good,
116502	
116503	the message
116504	they
116505	heard
116506	join in with
116507	did not
116508	since they
116509	
116510	in faith.
116511	those
116512	who heard it
116513	enter
116514	For
116515	
116516	
116517	that rest,
116518	
116519	we who have believed
116520	as
116521	he has said,
116522	“As
116523	I swore
116524	in
116525	
116526	my anger,
116527	
116528	‘They will never
116529	enter
116530	
116531	
116532	my rest!’”
116533	
116534	And yet
116535	
116536	God’s works
116537	from
116538	the foundation
116539	of the world.
116540	were accomplished
116541	he has spoken
116542	For
116543	somewhere
116544	about
116545	
116546	the seventh
116547	day in this way:
116548	
116549	rested
116550	
116551	“And God
116552	on
116553	
116554	day
116555	
116556	the seventh
116557	from
116558	all
116559	
116560	his works,”
116561	
116562	
116563	
116564	
116565	but to repeat
116566	the text cited earlier: “They will never
116567	enter
116568	
116569	
116570	my rest!”
116571	
116572	
116573	Therefore
116574	it remains
116575	for some
116576	to enter it,
116577	
116578	
116579	
116580	
116581	yet those to whom it was previously
116582	proclaimed
116583	did not
116584	enter
116585	because of
116586	disobedience.
116587	So God again
116588	a certain
116589	ordains
116590	day,
116591	“Today,”
116592	through
116593	David
116594	speaking
116595	after
116596	so long
116597	a time,
116598	as
116599	in the words quoted before,
116600	that today
116601	“Oh,
116602	
116603	as he speaks!
116604	
116605	you would listen
116606	Do not
116607	harden
116608	
116609	your hearts.”
116610	
116611	if
116612	For
116613	
116614	Joshua
116615	had given them
116616	rest, God would not
116617	
116618	about
116619	another
116620	have spoken
116621	
116622	afterward
116623	day.
116624	Consequently
116625	remains
116626	a Sabbath rest
116627	
116628	for the people
116629	
116630	of God.
116631	
116632	For
116633	the one who enters
116634	
116635	
116636	God’s rest
116637	
116638	
116639	
116640	has also rested
116641	from
116642	
116643	his works,
116644	
116645	just as
116646	did from
116647	
116648	his own works.
116649	
116650	God
116651	we must make every effort
116652	Thus
116653	to enter
116654	
116655	that
116656	
116657	rest,
116658	so that
116659	no
116660	by
116661	
116662	
116663	one
116664	following the same pattern
116665	may fall
116666	
116667	of disobedience.
116668	is living
116669	For
116670	
116671	the word
116672	
116673	of God
116674	
116675	and active
116676	
116677	and sharper
116678	than
116679	any
116680	sword,
116681	double-edged
116682	
116683	piercing
116684	even to the point of
116685	dividing
116686	soul
116687	
116688	from spirit,
116689	joints
116690	and
116691	
116692	from marrow;
116693	
116694	it is able to judge
116695	the desires
116696	
116697	and thoughts
116698	of the heart.
116699	
116700	And no
116701	is
116702	creature
116703	hidden
116704	from
116705	
116706	everything
116707	God, but
116708	is naked
116709	
116710	and exposed
116711	
116712	to the eyes of him
116713	
116714	to
116715	whom
116716	
116717	
116718	we must render an account.
116719	since we have
116720	Therefore
116721	
116722	a great
116723	high priest who has passed through
116724	
116725	the heavens,
116726	Jesus
116727	
116728	the Son
116729	
116730	of God,
116731	let us hold fast
116732	
116733	to our confession.
116734	we do not
116735	For
116736	have
116737	a high priest
116738	
116739	incapable
116740	of sympathizing
116741	
116742	with our weaknesses,
116743	
116744	one who has been tempted
116745	but
116746	in
116747	every way
116748	
116749	just as
116750	we are, yet without
116751	sin.
116752	approach
116753	Therefore
116754	
116755	let us confidently
116756	
116757	the throne
116758	
116759	of grace
116760	to
116761	receive
116762	mercy
116763	
116764	grace
116765	and find
116766	
116767	whenever we need
116768	help.
116769	every
116770	For
116771	high priest
116772	from among
116773	the people
116774	is taken
116775	to represent
116776	them
116777	and appointed
116778	
116779	before
116780	
116781	God,
116782	to
116783	offer
116784	gifts
116785	both
116786	
116787	and sacrifices
116788	for
116789	sins.
116790	to deal compassionately
116791	He is able
116792	
116793	with those who are ignorant
116794	
116795	and erring,
116796	since
116797	
116798	
116799	he also is subject
116800	to weakness,
116801	
116802	and for
116803	
116804	this reason he is obligated
116805	as well as
116806	offerings for himself
116807	
116808	the people.
116809	
116810	
116811	for
116812	
116813	to make
116814	
116815	sin
116816	
116817	And no
116818	on his own initiative,
116819	one
116820	assumes
116821	
116822	this honor
116823	but
116824	only when called
116825	to it by
116826	
116827	God,
116828	as in fact
116829	
116830	Aaron was.
116831	So
116832	
116833	
116834	also Christ
116835	did not
116836	himself
116837	glorify
116838	in becoming
116839	high priest,
116840	but
116841	the one who glorified him was God,
116842	who said
116843	to him,
116844	
116845	my Son!
116846	
116847	“You are
116848	
116849	
116850	Today
116851	I have fathered you,”
116852	
116853	as
116854	
116855	also in
116856	another place
116857	God says,
116858	
116859	“You are a priest
116860	
116861	
116862	forever
116863	in
116864	
116865	the order
116866	of Melchizedek.”
116867	Christ
116868	During
116869	
116870	life
116871	
116872	his earthly
116873	
116874	requests
116875	both
116876	
116877	and supplications,
116878	to
116879	
116880	the one who was able
116881	to save him
116882	
116883	from
116884	death
116885	with
116886	cries
116887	loud
116888	
116889	and tears,
116890	offered
116891	
116892	and he was heard
116893	because of
116894	
116895	his devotion.
116896	Although
116897	he was
116898	a son,
116899	he learned
116900	through
116901	the things
116902	he suffered.
116903	
116904	obedience
116905	
116906	And by being perfected
116907	in this way, he became
116908	to all
116909	
116910	who obey him,
116911	
116912	the source
116913	salvation
116914	of eternal
116915	and he was designated
116916	by
116917	
116918	God
116919	as high priest
116920	in
116921	
116922	the order
116923	of Melchizedek.
116924	On
116925	
116926	we have much
116927	
116928	
116929	this topic
116930	
116931	and it is difficult to explain,
116932	to say
116933	since
116934	sluggish
116935	you have become
116936	
116937	in hearing.
116938	
116939	For
116940	though you should
116941	in fact be
116942	teachers
116943	by
116944	
116945	this time,
116946	
116947	you need
116948	
116949	
116950	someone to teach you
116951	
116952	
116953	
116954	elements
116955	
116956	the beginning
116957	
116958	utterances.
116959	
116960	of God’s
116961	
116962	You have gone back
116963	to needing
116964	
116965	milk,
116966	
116967	not
116968	solid
116969	food.
116970	everyone
116971	For
116972	
116973	who lives
116974	on milk
116975	is inexperienced
116976	in the message
116977	of righteousness,
116978	an infant.
116979	because
116980	he is
116981	for the mature,
116982	But
116983	is
116984	
116985	solid
116986	food
116987	
116988	by
116989	
116990	practice
116991	
116992	whose perceptions
116993	are trained
116994	
116995	to
116996	discern
116997	good
116998	both
116999	
117000	and evil.
117001	Therefore
117002	we must progress beyond
117003	
117004	
117005	the elementary
117006	
117007	about Christ
117008	instructions
117009	to
117010	
117011	maturity,
117012	and move on
117013	not
117014	again:
117015	this foundation
117016	laying
117017	repentance
117018	from
117019	dead
117020	works
117021	
117022	and faith
117023	in
117024	God,
117025	about ritual washings,
117026	teaching
117027	laying on
117028	
117029	of hands,
117030	resurrection
117031	
117032	of the dead,
117033	
117034	judgment.
117035	and eternal
117036	
117037	
117038	And this is what we intend to do,
117039	
117040	permits.
117041	
117042	if God
117043	it is impossible
117044	For
117045	
117046	in the case of those who have once
117047	been enlightened,
117048	tasted
117049	
117050	
117051	gift,
117052	
117053	the heavenly
117054	
117055	partakers
117056	become
117057	Spirit,
117058	of the Holy
117059	
117060	the good
117061	tasted
117062	of God
117063	word
117064	the miracles
117065	and
117066	of the coming
117067	age,
117068	
117069	and then have committed apostasy,
117070	them again
117071	to renew
117072	to
117073	repentance,
117074	since they are crucifying
117075	for themselves all over again
117076	
117077	the Son
117078	
117079	of God
117080	
117081	and holding him up to contempt.
117082	the ground
117083	For
117084	
117085	that has soaked up
117086	
117087	on
117088	
117089	falls
117090	that frequently
117091	the rain
117092	
117093	it and yields
117094	vegetation
117095	useful
117096	for those
117097	
117098	who
117099	
117100	tend
117101	it receives
117102	a blessing
117103	from
117104	
117105	God.
117106	if it produces
117107	But
117108	thorns
117109	
117110	and thistles,
117111	it is useless
117112	
117113	to be cursed;
117114	and about
117115	its
117116	
117117	fate
117118	is to
117119	be burned.
117120	we are convinced
117121	But
117122	in
117123	
117124	your case, dear friends,
117125	
117126	of better things
117127	
117128	relating
117129	to salvation.
117130	even though
117131	
117132	like this,
117133	we speak
117134	is not
117135	For
117136	unjust
117137	
117138	God
117139	so as to forget
117140	
117141	your work
117142	
117143	
117144	
117145	and the love
117146	
117147	you have demonstrated
117148	for
117149	
117150	his name,
117151	
117152	in having served
117153	
117154	the saints.
117155	
117156	and continuing to serve
117157	we passionately want
117158	But
117159	each
117160	
117161	
117162	
117163	of you to demonstrate
117164	the same eagerness
117165	for
117166	
117167	the fulfillment
117168	
117169	of your hope
117170	until
117171	the end,
117172	so that
117173	you may not
117174	sluggish,
117175	be
117176	imitators
117177	but
117178	
117179	of those who through
117180	faith
117181	
117182	and perseverance
117183	inherit
117184	
117185	the promises.
117186	
117187	Now
117188	to Abraham,
117189	his promise
117190	
117191	when God
117192	since
117193	by
117194	no one
117195	made
117196	greater,
117197	he could swear
117198	he swore
117199	by
117200	himself,
117201	saying,
117202	“Surely
117203	
117204	I will bless
117205	you greatly
117206	
117207	
117208	and multiply
117209	your descendants abundantly.”
117210	
117211	
117212	And so
117213	by persevering,
117214	Abraham inherited
117215	
117216	the promise.
117217	people
117218	For
117219	by
117220	
117221	something greater than themselves,
117222	swear
117223	
117224	all
117225	
117226	dispute.
117227	to end
117228	serves as a
117229	confirmation
117230	
117231	and the oath
117232	In
117233	the same way
117234	more clearly
117235	wanted

117239	
117240	to the heirs
117241	
117242	of the promise

117244	was unchangeable,
117245	
117246	that his purpose
117247	
117248	and so he intervened
117249	with an oath,
117250	so that
117251	us through
117252	two
117253	things,
117254	unchangeable
117255	
117256	
117257	since it is impossible
117258	to lie.
117259	
117260	for God
117261	in him may find strong
117262	encouragement
117263	we who have

117275	for the soul,
117276	sure
117277	
117278	
117279	and steadfast,
117280	
117281	which reaches
117282	
117283	
117284	inside behind
117285	
117286	the curtain,
117287	where
117288	our forerunner
117289	on
117290	
117291	entered
117292	Jesus
117293	in
117294	
117295	the order
117296	of Melchizedek.
117297	a priest

117299	
117300	
117301	forever
117302	
117303	Now
117304	
117305	this Melchizedek,
117306	king
117307	of Salem,
117308	priest

117312	of the most high
117313	
117314	met
117315	Abraham
117316	as he was returning
117317	from
117318	
117319	defeating
117320	
117321	the kings
117322	
117323	and blessed him.
117324	
117325	To him
117326	
117327	a tithe
117328	of
117329	everything.
117330	apportioned
117331	also Abraham
117332	His name first
117333	
117334	means
117335	king
117336	of righteousness,
117337	then
117338	
117339	
117340	king
117341	of Salem,
117342	that
117343	is,
117344	king
117345	of peace.
117346	Without father,
117347	without mother,

117357	but
117358	
117359	the son
117360	
117361	of God,
117362	and he remains
117363	a priest
117364	for
117365	
117366	all time.
117367	see
117368	But
117369	how great
117370	
117371	him
117372	
117373	a tithe
117374	he must be, if Abraham
117375	gave
117376	of
117377	
117378	his plunder.
117379	
117380	the patriarch
117381	
117382	
117383	
117384	And those of
117385	
117386	the sons
117387	of Levi
117388	
117389	the priestly office
117390	who receive
117391	authorization
117392	have
117393	to collect a tithe
117394	
117395	from the people,
117396	according to
117397	
117398	the law
117399	
117400	that is,
117401	
117402	from their fellow countrymen,
117403	
117404	although
117405	
117406	
117407	
117408	they too are descendants
117409	of Abraham.
117410	
117411	But
117412	Melchizedek who does not
117413	share
117414	
117415	
117416	their ancestry collected a tithe
117417	from Abraham
117418	
117419	
117420	the one who possessed
117421	
117422	the promise.
117423	and blessed
117424	without
117425	Now
117426	
117427	dispute
117428	
117429	the inferior
117430	by
117431	
117432	the superior,
117433	is blessed
117434	
117435	
117436	and in one case
117437	tithes
117438	by mortal
117439	men,
117440	are received
117441	in the other
117442	while
117443	by him who is affirmed
117444	
117445	to be alive.
117446	
117447	And it could
117448	
117449	be said
117450	through
117451	Abraham.
117452	
117453	that Levi
117454	
117455	
117456	himself, who receives
117457	tithes, paid a tithe
117458	still
117459	For
117460	in
117461	
117462	Abraham’s loins
117463	
117464	his ancestor
117465	he was
117466	when
117467	met him.
117468	
117469	Melchizedek
117470	if
117471	had in fact
117472	So
117473	perfection
117474	possible through
117475	
117476	the Levitical
117477	priesthood –
117478	been
117479	
117480	that basis the people
117481	for
117482	on
117483	
117484	received the law –
117485	what
117486	further
117487	need
117488	to be in
117489	
117490	the order
117491	of Melchizedek
117492	would there have been for another
117493	to arise,
117494	priest
117495	
117496	and not
117497	in
117498	
117499	order?
117500	Aaron’s
117501	said
117502	changes,
117503	For
117504	
117505	when the priesthood
117506	
117507	must
117508	
117509	in the law
117510	a change
117511	come as well.
117512	
117513	the one
117514	Yet
117515	these things are spoken about
117516	
117517	tribe,
117518	to a different
117519	belongs
117520	from
117521	that tribe
117522	and no one
117523	has ever officiated
117524	
117525	at the altar.
117526	it is clear
117527	For
117528	
117529	from
117530	Judah,
117531	is descended
117532	
117533	our Lord
117534	
117535	in
117536	that
117537	connection with that tribe.
117538	about
117539	priests
117540	nothing
117541	yet Moses
117542	said
117543	
117544	
117545	even
117546	clearer
117547	And this is
117548	if
117549	in
117550	
117551	the likeness
117552	of Melchizedek,
117553	arises
117554	priest
117555	another
117556	who
117557	a priest not
117558	by
117559	a legal
117560	regulation
117561	about physical descent
117562	has become
117563	but
117564	by
117565	the power
117566	life.
117567	of an indestructible
117568	here is the testimony about him:
117569	For
117570	
117571	
117572	“You are a priest
117573	
117574	
117575	forever
117576	in
117577	
117578	the order
117579	of Melchizedek.”
117580	set aside
117581	On the one hand
117582	
117583	is
117584	a former
117585	command
117586	because it
117587	
117588	
117589	is weak
117590	
117591	and useless,
117592	nothing perfect.
117593	for
117594	made
117595	
117596	the law
117597	is introduced,
117598	On the other hand
117599	a better
117600	hope
117601	through
117602	which
117603	we draw near
117604	
117605	to God.
117606	
117607	
117608	And since
117609	this was not
117610	done without
117611	a sworn affirmation –
117612	
117613	
117614	for
117615	without
117616	a sworn affirmation,
117617	
117618	priests
117619	the others have become
117620	
117621	but
117622	Jesus did so with
117623	a sworn affirmation
117624	by
117625	
117626	the one who said
117627	to him,
117628	
117629	has sworn
117630	“The Lord
117631	
117632	and will not
117633	change his mind,
117634	
117635	‘You are a priest
117636	
117637	
117638	forever’” –
117639	
117640	accordingly
117641	
117642	of a better
117643	covenant.
117644	has become
117645	the guarantee
117646	Jesus
117647	
117648	
117649	And the others
117650	numerous,
117651	were
117652	who became
117653	priests
117654	because
117655	
117656	death
117657	prevented
117658	them from continuing in office,
117659	
117660	but
117661	since
117662	
117663	he lives
117664	
117665	
117666	
117667	forever.
117668	permanently
117669	he holds
117670	
117671	his priesthood
117672	So
117673	
117674	save
117675	to
117676	
117677	completely
117678	he is able
117679	
117680	those who come
117681	through him,
117682	
117683	
117684	to God
117685	because he always
117686	lives
117687	to
117688	
117689	intercede
117690	for them.
117691	
117692	to have such
117693	For
117694	
117695	
117696	it is indeed fitting for us
117697	a high priest:
117698	holy,
117699	innocent,
117700	undefiled,
117701	separate
117702	from
117703	
117704	sinners,
117705	
117706	above
117707	
117708	the heavens.
117709	and exalted
117710	He
117711	no
117712	has
117713	to do every
117714	day
117715	need
117716	
117717	
117718	what those priests
117719	first
117720	for
117721	
117722	their own
117723	sins
117724	sacrifices
117725	do, to offer
117726	and then
117727	
117728	
117729	for the sins of the people,
117730	
117731	since
117732	he did
117733	once for all.
117734	himself
117735	this in offering
117736	
117737	the law
117738	For
117739	men
117740	appoints
117741	as high priests
117742	subject
117743	to weakness,
117744	
117745	the word
117746	but
117747	
117748	of solemn affirmation
117749	
117750	that came after
117751	
117752	the law
117753	appoints a son
117754	
117755	
117756	forever.
117757	made perfect
117758	the main point
117759	Now
117760	of
117761	
117762	what we are saying
117763	such
117764	is this: We have
117765	a high priest,
117766	one who
117767	sat down
117768	at
117769	the right hand
117770	
117771	of the throne
117772	
117773	of the Majesty
117774	in
117775	
117776	heaven,
117777	
117778	in the sanctuary
117779	a minister
117780	
117781	
117782	tabernacle
117783	
117784	and the true
117785	that
117786	set up.
117787	
117788	the Lord,
117789	not
117790	man,
117791	every
117792	For
117793	high priest
117794	
117795	
117796	to offer
117797	gifts
117798	both
117799	
117800	and sacrifices.
117801	is appointed
117802	So
117803	too had
117804	to have
117805	something
117806	
117807	
117808	this one
117809	to offer.
117810	if
117811	
117812	Now
117813	he were
117814	on
117815	earth,
117816	not
117817	
117818	he would
117819	a priest,
117820	be
117821	
117822	since there are already priests who offer
117823	prescribed by
117824	the law.
117825	
117826	the gifts
117827	The place where they
117828	is a sketch
117829	
117830	and shadow
117831	serve
117832	
117833	of the heavenly sanctuary,
117834	just as
117835	was warned by God
117836	Moses
117837	as he was about
117838	to complete
117839	
117840	the tabernacle.
117841	“See
117842	For
117843	he says,
117844	that you make
117845	everything
117846	according to
117847	
117848	the design
117849	
117850	shown to you
117851	
117852	on
117853	
117854	the mountain.”
117855	now
117856	But
117857	a superior
117858	Jesus has obtained
117859	ministry,
117860	since
117861	
117862	better
117863	
117864	the covenant
117865	that he mediates
117866	
117867	on
117868	is also better
117869	promises.
117870	and is enacted
117871	if
117872	For
117873	
117874	first
117875	that
117876	covenant had been
117877	faultless,
117878	no
117879	
117880	a second one.
117881	would have looked for
117882	one
117883	showing
117884	But
117885	
117886	its fault, God says to them,
117887	“Look,
117888	the days
117889	are coming,
117890	says
117891	the Lord,
117892	
117893	when I will complete
117894	with
117895	
117896	the house
117897	of Israel
117898	
117899	and with
117900	
117901	the house
117902	of Judah.
117903	covenant
117904	a new
117905	“It will not
117906	be like
117907	
117908	the covenant
117909	that
117910	I made
117911	
117912	with their fathers,
117913	
117914	on
117915	the day
117916	when I took them
117917	
117918	
117919	by the hand
117920	
117921	to lead them
117922	
117923	out of
117924	
117925	Egypt,
117926	
117927	
117928	because they did not
117929	continue
117930	in
117931	
117932	my covenant
117933	
117934	and I
117935	had no regard for them,
117936	
117937	says

117939	
117940	
117941	
117942	“For this is the covenant

117944	I will establish

117948	after
117949	
117950	days,
117951	those
117952	says
117953	the Lord.
117954	I will put
117955	my laws

118018	When
118019	
118020	he speaks

118034	Now
118035	
118036	
118037	the first

118041	and
118042	sanctuary.
118043	its earthly
118044	a tent
118045	For
118046	was prepared,
118047	
118048	the outer
118049	
118050	one, which
118051	
118052	
118053	contained the lampstand,
118054	
118055	
118056	the table,
118057	
118058	
118059	and the presentation
118060	
118061	of the loaves;
118062	this
118063	is called
118064	the holy place.
118065	after
118066	And
118067	
118068	the second
118069	curtain
118070	there was a tent
118071	
118072	called
118073	the holy
118074	of holies.
118075	the golden
118076	It contained
118077	altar of incense
118078	
118079	
118080	and the ark
118081	
118082	of the covenant
118083	covered
118084	entirely
118085	with gold.
118086	In
118087	this ark
118088	urn
118089	were the golden
118090	containing
118091	
118092	the manna,
118093	
118094	
118095	rod
118096	Aaron’s
118097	
118098	that budded,
118099	
118100	
118101	and the stone tablets
118102	
118103	of the covenant.
118104	above
118105	And
118106	
118107	the ark were the cherubim
118108	of glory
118109	overshadowing
118110	
118111	the mercy seat.
118112	of
118113	these things
118114	not
118115	is
118116	Now
118117	the time to speak
118118	in
118119	detail.
118120	
118121	
118122	So
118123	with these things prepared
118124	into
118125	
118126	
118127	the outer
118128	tent
118129	
118130	continually

118132	
118133	like this, the priests
118134	
118135	their duties.
118136	as they perform
118137	into
118138	But
118139	
118140	the inner
118141	enters once
118142	
118143	a year
118144	only
118145	
118146	the high priest
118147	tent, and not
118148	without
118149	blood
118150	that
118151	he offers
118152	for
118153	himself
118154	and
118155	for the sins
118156	of the
118157	people
118158	committed in ignorance.
118159	
118160	is making clear
118161	
118162	Spirit
118163	
118164	The Holy
118165	not yet
118166	had
118167	
118168	
118169	into the holy place
118170	that the way
118171	appeared as long as
118172	
118173	the old
118174	tabernacle
118175	was
118176	standing.
118177	This
118178	was a symbol
118179	for
118180	
118181	the time
118182	
118183	then present,
118184	when
118185	
118186	gifts
118187	
118188	
118189	and sacrifices
118190	were offered
118191	not
118192	that could
118193	
118194	the conscience
118195	perfect
118196	
118197	of the worshiper.
118198	They served only
118199	for matters of
118200	food
118201	
118202	and drink
118203	
118204	and various
118205	ritual washings;
118206	regulations
118207	they are external
118208	until
118209	the new
118210	order came.
118211	imposed
118212	now Christ
118213	But
118214	
118215	as the high priest
118216	
118217	has come
118218	of the good things
118219	to come. He passed through
118220	
118221	the greater
118222	
118223	and more perfect
118224	tent
118225	not
118226	made with hands,
118227	
118228	that is,
118229	not
118230	
118231	
118232	of this creation,
118233	and
118234	not by
118235	the blood
118236	of goats
118237	
118238	and calves
118239	by
118240	but
118241	
118242	his own
118243	blood,
118244	he entered
118245	once for all
118246	into
118247	
118248	the most holy place
118249	eternal
118250	redemption.
118251	and so he himself secured
118252	if
118253	For
118254	
118255	the blood
118256	of goats
118257	
118258	and bulls
118259	
118260	and the ashes
118261	of a young cow
118262	sprinkled
118263	
118264	on those who are defiled
118265	consecrated
118266	them and provided
118267	
118268	
118269	ritual
118270	purity,
118271	how much
118272	more
118273	
118274	will the blood
118275	
118276	of Christ,
118277	who
118278	through
118279	Spirit
118280	the eternal
118281	himself
118282	offered
118283	without blemish
118284	
118285	to God,
118286	purify
118287	
118288	our consciences
118289	
118290	from
118291	dead
118292	works
118293	to
118294	
118295	worship
118296	God.
118297	the living
118298	
118299	And so
118300	
118301	covenant,
118302	of a new
118303	the mediator
118304	he is
118305	so that
118306	since he died
118307	
118308	to
118309	set
118310	
118311	committed under
118312	
118313	the first
118314	covenant.
118315	them free from the violations
118316	
118317	he has promised,
118318	may receive
118319	
118320	those who are called
118321	
118322	the eternal
118323	inheritance
118324	where
118325	For
118326	there is a will,
118327	the death
118328	it must
118329	be proven.
118330	
118331	of the one who made
118332	a will
118333	For
118334	only at
118335	death,
118336	takes effect
118337	since
118338	it carries no
118339	force
118340	while
118341	it is alive.
118342	
118343	the one who made
118344	So
118345	
118346	
118347	even the first
118348	
118349	with blood.
118350	covenant was inaugurated
118351	had spoken
118352	For
118353	every
118354	command
118355	according to
118356	
118357	the law,
118358	
118359	when Moses
118360	to all
118361	
118362	the people
118363	he took
118364	
118365	the blood
118366	
118367	of calves
118368	
118369	
118370	and goats
118371	with
118372	water
118373	
118374	wool
118375	and scarlet
118376	
118377	and hyssop
118378	
118379	both
118380	
118381	the book
118382	
118383	itself and all
118384	
118385	the people,
118386	and sprinkled
118387	and said,
118388	
118389	
118390	“This is the blood
118391	
118392	of the covenant
118393	that
118394	has commanded you to keep.”
118395	
118396	
118397	
118398	God
118399	
118400	
118401	the tabernacle
118402	And both
118403	
118404	and all
118405	
118406	the utensils
118407	
118408	of worship
118409	
118410	with blood.
118411	he likewise
118412	sprinkled
118413	
118414	almost
118415	with
118416	blood,
118417	everything
118418	was purified
118419	Indeed according to
118420	
118421	the law
118422	
118423	and without
118424	the shedding of blood
118425	no
118426	there is
118427	forgiveness.
118428	it was necessary
118429	So
118430	
118431	
118432	for the sketches
118433	
118434	of the things in
118435	
118436	heaven
118437	
118438	to be purified
118439	
118440	but
118441	
118442	the heavenly things themselves
118443	required better sacrifices
118444	with these sacrifices,
118445	than these.
118446	
118447	did not
118448	For
118449	into
118450	made with hands –
118451	enter
118452	a sanctuary
118453	Christ
118454	the representation
118455	
118456	of the true
118457	sanctuary – but
118458	
118459	
118460	
118461	heaven
118462	now
118463	itself, and he appears
118464	
118465	presence
118466	
118467	in God’s
118468	for us.
118469	
118470	And
118471	he did not enter to
118472	again and again,
118473	offer
118474	himself
118475	the way
118476	
118477	the high priest
118478	enters
118479	
118480	
118481	the sanctuary
118482	
118483	year after year
118484	with
118485	blood
118486	that is not his own,
118487	for then
118488	he would have had
118489	
118490	again and again
118491	to suffer
118492	since
118493	the foundation
118494	of
118495	now
118496	the world. But
118497	once for all
118498	at
118499	the consummation
118500	
118501	of the ages
118502	to
118503	put away
118504	
118505	sin
118506	by
118507	
118508	his sacrifice.
118509	
118510	he has appeared
118511	
118512	
118513	And just as
118514	are appointed
118515	
118516	people
118517	once,
118518	to die
118519	then
118520	and
118521	
118522	to face judgment,
118523	so
118524	
118525	
118526	also, after Christ
118527	once
118528	was offered
118529	to
118530	
118531	of many,
118532	bear
118533	the sins
118534	
118535	a second
118536	time, not
118537	to bear sin
118538	he will appear
118539	
118540	
118541	to those who eagerly await him
118542	but to
118543	bring salvation.
118544	a shadow
118545	For
118546	possesses
118547	
118548	the law
118549	
118550	to come
118551	of the good things
118552	but not
118553	
118554	
118555	the reality
118556	
118557	
118558	
118559	year after year,
118560	
118561	
118562	by the same sacrifices
118563	
118564	offered
118565	
118566	
118567	continually,
118568	
118569	itself, and is therefore completely unable,
118570	
118571	those who come to worship.
118572	to perfect
118573	For otherwise
118574	would they not
118575	
118576	have ceased
118577	to be offered,
118578	since
118579	
118580	no
118581	and so have
118582	further
118583	consciousness
118584	of sin?
118585	
118586	the worshipers
118587	once for all
118588	would have been purified
118589	But
118590	in
118591	
118592	those sacrifices there is a reminder
118593	of sins
118594	
118595	year after year.
118596	it is impossible
118597	For
118598	for the blood
118599	of bulls
118600	
118601	and goats
118602	to take away
118603	sins.
118604	So
118605	when he came
118606	into
118607	
118608	the world,
118609	he said,
118610	“Sacrifice
118611	
118612	and offering
118613	you did not
118614	desire,
118615	a body
118616	but
118617	you prepared for me.
118618	
118619	“Whole burnt offerings
118620	
118621	
118622	and sin-offerings
118623	no delight in.
118624	you took
118625	“Then
118626	I said,
118627	‘Here I am:
118628	I have come –
118629	in
118630	the scroll
118631	of the book –
118632	it is written
118633	of me
118634	
118635	
118636	to do
118637	
118638	O God.’”
118639	
118640	your will,
118641	
118642	above,
118643	When he says
118644	
118645	“Sacrifices
118646	
118647	
118648	
118649	and offerings
118650	
118651	
118652	and whole burnt offerings and sin-offerings
118653	you did not
118654	desire
118655	nor
118656	did you take delight
118657	in them” (which
118658	according to
118659	the law),
118660	are offered
118661	then
118662	he says,
118663	“Here I am:
118664	I have come
118665	
118666	to do
118667	
118668	your will.”
118669	
118670	He does away
118671	
118672	with the first
118673	to
118674	
118675	the second.
118676	establish
118677	By
118678	his
118679	will
118680	made holy
118681	we have been
118682	through
118683	
118684	the offering
118685	
118686	of the body
118687	of Jesus
118688	Christ
118689	once for all.
118690	
118691	And every
118692	
118693	priest
118694	stands
118695	
118696	day after day
118697	serving
118698	
118699	
118700	
118701	again and again –
118702	and offering
118703	the same sacrifices
118704	sacrifices that
118705	never
118706	can
118707	take away
118708	sins.
118709	
118710	But
118711	one
118712	
118713	sins
118714	when this priest had offered
118715	sacrifice
118716	for
118717	
118718	for all time,
118719	
118720	he sat down at
118721	the right hand
118722	
118723	of God,
118724	
118725	where he is now
118726	waiting
118727	until
118728	are made
118729	
118730	his enemies
118731	
118732	a footstool
118733	
118734	for his feet.
118735	
118736	by one
118737	For
118738	offering
118739	he has perfected
118740	for
118741	
118742	all time
118743	
118744	those who are made holy.
118745	also witnesses to us,
118746	And
118747	
118748	
118749	
118750	Spirit
118751	
118752	the Holy
118753	after
118754	for
118755	
118756	saying,
118757	
118758	
118759	“This is the covenant
118760	that
118761	I will establish
118762	with them
118763	
118764	after
118765	
118766	days,
118767	those
118768	says
118769	the Lord.
118770	I will put
118771	my laws
118772	
118773	on
118774	their hearts
118775	
118776	
118777	on
118778	
118779	their minds,”
118780	
118781	and I will inscribe them
118782	
118783	
118784	
118785	then he says, “Their sins
118786	
118787	
118788	
118789	and their lawless deeds
118790	
118791	
118792	no
118793	I will remember
118794	longer.”
118795	where
118796	Now
118797	there is forgiveness of these,
118798	
118799	there is no longer
118800	any offering
118801	for
118802	sin.
118803	since we have
118804	Therefore,
118805	brothers and sisters,
118806	confidence
118807	to
118808	
118809	enter
118810	
118811	the sanctuary
118812	by
118813	
118814	the blood
118815	of Jesus,
118816	that
118817	he inaugurated for us
118818	
118819	way
118820	by the fresh
118821	
118822	and living
118823	through
118824	
118825	the curtain,
118826	
118827	that is,
118828	
118829	through his flesh,
118830	
118831	
118832	priest
118833	and since we have a great
118834	over
118835	
118836	the house
118837	
118838	of God,
118839	let us draw near
118840	with
118841	a sincere
118842	heart
118843	in
118844	the assurance
118845	that faith
118846	sprinkled clean
118847	
118848	brings, because we have had our hearts
118849	from
118850	conscience
118851	an evil
118852	
118853	washed
118854	
118855	and our bodies
118856	water.
118857	in pure
118858	And let us hold
118859	
118860	that we confess,
118861	
118862	to the hope
118863	unwaveringly
118864	is trustworthy.
118865	for
118866	
118867	the one who made the promise
118868	
118869	And let us take thought
118870	one another
118871	of how to
118872	spur
118873	on to love
118874	
118875	and good
118876	works,
118877	not
118878	abandoning
118879	
118880	meetings,
118881	our own
118882	as
118883	are in the habit
118884	some
118885	of doing, but
118886	encouraging each other,
118887	
118888	and even
118889	more
118890	so because
118891	you see
118892	drawing near.
118893	
118894	the day
118895	if we deliberately
118896	For
118897	keep on sinning
118898	
118899	after
118900	
118901	receiving
118902	
118903	the knowledge
118904	
118905	of the truth,
118906	no further
118907	for
118908	sins
118909	is left for us,
118910	sacrifice
118911	fearful
118912	but
118913	only a certain
118914	expectation
118915	of judgment
118916	
118917	of fire
118918	and a fury
118919	consume
118920	that will
118921	
118922	God’s enemies.
118923	who rejected
118924	Someone
118925	the law
118926	of Moses
118927	without
118928	mercy
118929	on
118930	the testimony of two
118931	or
118932	three
118933	witnesses.
118934	was put to death
118935	How much
118936	do you think
118937	greater
118938	that person deserves
118939	punishment
118940	
118941	
118942	for the Son
118943	
118944	of God,
118945	who has contempt
118946	
118947	
118948	the blood
118949	
118950	of the covenant
118951	
118952	and profanes
118953	that
118954	him
118955	made
118956	
118957	
118958	the Spirit
118959	
118960	of grace?
118961	holy, and insults
118962	we know
118963	For
118964	
118965	the one who said,
118966	
118967	“Vengeance
118968	
118969	is mine, I will repay,”
118970	
118971	and again,
118972	will judge
118973	“The Lord
118974	
118975	his people.”
118976	
118977	It is a terrifying
118978	
118979	thing to fall
118980	into
118981	the hands
118982	God.
118983	of the living
118984	remember
118985	But
118986	
118987	the former
118988	days
118989	
118990	when
118991	after you were enlightened.
118992	a harsh
118993	conflict
118994	you endured
118995	of suffering
118996	
118997	At times
118998	to abuse
118999	
119000	
119001	and afflictions,
119002	you were publicly exposed
119003	
119004	and at other times
119005	to share
119006	
119007	in that way.
119008	with others who were treated
119009	you came
119010	in fact
119011	For
119012	
119013	of those in prison,
119014	you shared the sufferings
119015	
119016	
119017	the confiscation
119018	
119019	of your belongings
119020	
119021	with
119022	joy,
119023	and you accepted
119024	because you knew
119025	had
119026	that you certainly
119027	a better
119028	possession.
119029	
119030	and lasting
119031	do not
119032	throw away
119033	So
119034	
119035	your confidence,
119036	
119037	because
119038	it has
119039	great
119040	reward.
119041	endurance
119042	For
119043	
119044	you need
119045	in order to
119046	
119047	will
119048	
119049	God’s
119050	do
119051	and so receive
119052	
119053	what is promised.
119054	just
119055	For
119056	a little
119057	longer
119058	
119059	
119060	and he who is coming
119061	will arrive
119062	
119063	and not
119064	delay.
119065	
119066	But
119067	my righteous one
119068	I
119069	by
119070	faith,
119071	will live
119072	
119073	and if
119074	he shrinks back,
119075	take no
119076	pleasure
119077	
119078	
119079	
119080	in him.
119081	
119082	
119083	But
119084	not
119085	we are
119086	among those who shrink back
119087	and thus
119088	perish,
119089	but
119090	are among those who have faith
119091	
119092	and preserve
119093	their souls.
119094	is
119095	Now
119096	faith
119097	we hope for,
119098	being sure
119099	of what
119100	being convinced
119101	of what we do not
119102	see.
119103	by
119104	
119105	For
119106	received God’s commendation.
119107	
119108	it the people of old
119109	By faith
119110	we understand
119111	were set in order
119112	
119113	that the worlds
119114	command,
119115	at God’s
119116	so that
119117	
119118	
119119	
119120	in the invisible.
119121	
119122	the visible
119123	has its origin
119124	By faith
119125	a greater
119126	sacrifice
119127	Abel
119128	than
119129	Cain,
119130	offered
119131	
119132	God
119133	and through
119134	his faith
119135	he was commended
119136	as
119137	righteous,
119138	commended
119139	him for
119140	
119141	his offerings.
119142	
119143	
119144	because God
119145	
119146	And through
119147	
119148	though he is dead.
119149	his faith he still
119150	speaks,
119151	By faith
119152	Enoch
119153	was taken up
119154	
119155	so that he did not
119156	see
119157	death,
119158	
119159	and he was not
119160	to be found
119161	because
119162	took
119163	him up.
119164	
119165	God
119166	before
119167	For
119168	
119169	his removal
119170	he had been commended
119171	as having pleased
119172	
119173	God.
119174	without
119175	Now
119176	faith
119177	it is impossible
119178	to please
119179	believe
119180	him, for
119181	must
119182	
119183	the one who approaches
119184	
119185	God
119186	
119187	that he exists
119188	
119189	
119190	those who seek him.
119191	
119192	and that he rewards
119193	
119194	By faith
119195	when he was warned
119196	Noah,
119197	about
119198	
119199	things not yet
119200	seen,
119201	with reverent regard
119202	constructed
119203	an ark
119204	for
119205	the deliverance
119206	
119207	of his family.
119208	
119209	Through
119210	faith
119211	he condemned
119212	
119213	the world
119214	
119215	
119216	that comes by
119217	faith.
119218	of the righteousness
119219	and became
119220	an heir
119221	By faith
119222	when he was called
119223	Abraham
119224	obeyed
119225	to go out
119226	to
119227	a place
119228	
119229	he would later
119230	receive
119231	as
119232	an inheritance,
119233	
119234	and he went out
119235	without
119236	understanding
119237	where
119238	he was going.
119239	By faith
119240	he lived as a foreigner
119241	
119242	land
119243	in the
119244	promised
119245	as though
119246	it were a foreign country,
119247	in
119248	tents
119249	living
119250	with
119251	Isaac
119252	
119253	and Jacob,
119254	
119255	who were fellow heirs
119256	
119257	of the same promise.
119258	
119259	
119260	he was looking forward
119261	For
119262	
119263	
119264	firm foundations,
119265	with
119266	to the city
119267	whose
119268	architect
119269	
119270	and builder
119271	
119272	is God.
119273	By faith,
119274	
119275	
119276	even though Sarah herself
119277	was barren
119278	the ability
119279	to
119280	
119281	procreate,
119282	he received
119283	
119284	
119285	and he was too
119286	old,
119287	because
119288	to be trustworthy.
119289	he regarded
119290	
119291	the one who had given the promise
119292	So
119293	
119294	by
119295	one man –
119296	in fact children were fathered
119297	
119298	
119299	and this one as good as dead –
119300	like
119301	
119302	of stars
119303	
119304	in the sky
119305	
119306	the number
119307	
119308	and like
119309	
119310	grains of sand
119311	
119312	on
119313	
119314	
119315	
119316	the seashore.
119317	
119318	the innumerable
119319	in
119320	faith
119321	died
119322	
119323	These all
119324	without
119325	receiving
119326	
119327	the things promised,
119328	but
119329	in the distance
119330	
119331	they saw them
119332	
119333	and welcomed
119334	
119335	them and acknowledged
119336	
119337	strangers
119338	
119339	and foreigners
119340	that they were
119341	on
119342	
119343	the earth.
119344	
119345	For
119346	in such a way
119347	those who speak
119348	make
119349	
119350	a homeland.
119351	it clear that they are seeking
119352	
119353	In fact, if
119354	
119355	
119356	they had been thinking of
119357	
119358	the land that
119359	they had left,
119360	they would have had
119361	
119362	opportunity
119363	to return.
119364	as it is,
119365	But
119366	to a better
119367	they aspire
119368	
119369	land, that is,
119370	a heavenly one.
119371	Therefore,
119372	is not
119373	ashamed
119374	
119375	
119376	God
119377	their God,
119378	to be called
119379	
119380	he has prepared

119385	offered up
119386	Abraham,
119387	
119388	Isaac.
119389	when he was tested,
119390	
119391	
119392	his only son.
119393	yet he was ready to offer up
119394	
119395	
119396	the promises,
119397	He had received
119398	
119399	him,
119400	God had told
119401	
119402	“Through
119403	Isaac
119404	will carry on your name,”
119405	
119406	descendants
119407	and he reasoned
119408	
119409	
119410	from
119411	the dead,
119412	even raise him
119413	could

119415	that God
119416	back from there.
119417	
119418	
119419	and in
119420	a sense
119421	he received him
119422	By faith
119423	
119424	concerning
119425	the future.
119426	blessed
119427	also Isaac

119436	each
119437	
119438	of the sons
119439	of Joseph
119440	blessed
119441	
119442	and worshiped
119443	
119444	
119445	as he leaned on
119446	
119447	his staff.
119448	
119449	By faith

119451	at the end of his life,
119452	about
119453	
119454	the exodus
119455	
119456	of the sons

119467	was born,
119468	hid
119469	him for three months,
119470	
119471	
119472	his parents
119473	
119474	because
119475	they saw

119484	
119485	of the king’s
119486	By faith,
119487	Moses
119488	
119489	when he grew up,
119490	refused
119491	to be called
119492	the son

119494	of Pharaoh’s
119495	rather
119496	choosing
119497	to be ill-treated
119498	
119499	with the people
119500	
119501	of God
119502	than

119505	sin’s
119506	to enjoy

119515	
119516	for Christ
119517	his eyes were fixed
119518	for
119519	on
119520	
119521	the reward.
119522	By faith
119523	he left
119524	Egypt
119525	without
119526	fearing
119527	
119528	anger,
119529	
119530	the king’s
119531	
119532	for
119533	the one who is invisible.
119534	as though
119535	he could see
119536	he persevered
119537	By faith
119538	he kept
119539	
119540	the Passover
119541	
119542	
119543	and the sprinkling
119544	
119545	of the blood,
119546	so that
119547	would not

119551	the firstborn
119552	touch them.

120038	
120039	of a trumpet
120040	and the blast
120041	
120042	and a voice
120043	uttering words
120044	such that
120045	
120046	those who heard
120047	begged
120048	no
120049	more.
120050	
120051	to hear
120052	they could not
120053	bear
120054	For
120055	
120056	what was commanded:
120057	“If even
120058	an animal
120059	touches
120060	
120061	the mountain,
120062	it must be stoned.”
120063	
120064	so
120065	terrifying
120066	was
120067	
120068	In fact, the scene
120069	that Moses
120070	said,
120071	with fear.”
120072	
120073	
120074	“I shudder
120075	But
120076	you have come
120077	Zion,

120114	
120115	Abel’s does.
120116	Take care
120117	not
120118	to refuse
120119	the one who
120120	is speaking!

120123	they
120124	did not
120125	escape
120126	on

120131	how much
120132	less
120133	shall we,
120134	
120135	the one who
120136	warns from

120165	this phrase “once

120167	
120168	
120169	of what is shaken,
120170	the removal

120172	of created things,

120182	let us give
120183	thanks,

120185	this
120186	let us offer worship

120188	
120189	to God
120190	in
120191	devotion and awe.
120192

120206	Do not

120210	because
120211	without knowing it.
120212	it some

120215	Remember
120216	
120217	those in prison
120218	as
120219	though you were in prison with

120221	them, and those ill-treated
120222	as
120223	
120224	
120225	though you too felt
120226	
120227	their torment.
120228	must be honored

120238	for
120239	
120240	sexually immoral people and adulterers.

120242	
120243	God
120244	must be free from the love of money
120245	
120246	Your conduct
120247	and you must be content
120248	
120249	with what you have,
120250	
120251	for
120252	he has said,
120253	
120254	“I will never

120262	So
120263	with confidence,
120264	
120265	we can say
120266	“The Lord
120267	
120268	is my helper,
120269	
120270	and I will not
120271	be afraid.
120272	What
120273	do to me?”
120274	
120275	can people
120276	Remember
120277	
120278	your leaders,
120279	
120280	who
120281	spoke

120283	
120284	message

120286	God’s

120290	on the outcome
120291	
120292	of their lives

120295	their faith.
120296	Jesus

120313	it is good
120314	For
120315	by grace,
120316	to be strengthened
120317	
120318	for the heart
120319	not
120320	ritual meals,
120321	
120322	which
120323	have never
120324	benefited
120325	
120326	those who participated in them.
120327	We have

120359	the camp.
120360	Therefore,

120365	by
120366	
120367	his own

120370	the people
120371	outside
120372	
120373	the camp.
120374	also suffered
120375	then,
120376	We must go out
120377	to him,
120378	
120379	outside
120380	
120381	the camp,
120382	
120383	the abuse he experienced.
120384	
120385	bearing

120396	Through him
120397	
120398	then
120399	offer up
120400	a sacrifice
120401	of praise
120402	
120403	let us continually

120405	to God,
120406	
120407	that is,
120408	the fruit
120409	of our lips,
120410	acknowledging
120411	
120412	his name.
120413	
120414	
120415	And
120416	to do good
120417	
120418	and to share

120436	over
120437	
120438	your souls
120439	
120440	
120441	an account
120442	and will give
120443	
120444	this with
120445	joy
120446	
120447	for their work. Let them do
120448	
120449	and not
120450	with complaints,
120451	this would be no advantage for you.
120452	for
120453	
120454	
120455	Pray
120456	for us,
120457	
120458	we are sure
120459	for
120460	
120461	a clear
120462	conscience
120463	that we have

120465	every respect.
120466	ourselves rightly

120538	
120539	of exhortation,
120540

120542	
120543	briefly.
120544	in fact I have written to you
120545	
120546	You should know
120547	
120548	that our brother
120549	
120550	Timothy
120551	has been released.
120552	will be with
120553	he
120554	If
120555	soon,
120556	he comes
120557	me when I see you.
120558	
120559	Greetings
120560	to all
120561	
120562	your leaders
120563	
120564	
120565	and all
120566	
120567	the saints.

120569	
120570	
120571	Those from

120575	Grace
120576	be with you
120577	all.
120578	
120579	From James,
120580	of God
120581	
120582	and the Lord
120583	Jesus
120584	Christ,
120585	a slave
120586	
120587	to the twelve
120588	tribes
120589	
120590	
120591	
120592	dispersed abroad.
120593	Greetings!
120594	it nothing but
120595	joy
120596	consider
120597	My brothers and sisters,
120598	
120599	when
120600	of trials,
120601	you fall into
120602	all sorts
120603	because you know
120604	
120605	
120606	that the testing
120607	
120608	
120609	of your faith
120610	produces
120611	endurance.
120612	
120613	And
120614	let endurance
120615	effect,
120616	its perfect
120617	have
120618	so that
120619	you will be
120620	perfect
120621	
120622	and complete,
120623	in anything.
120624	not
120625	deficient
120626	if
120627	But
120628	anyone
120629	
120630	is deficient
120631	in wisdom,
120632	he should ask
120633	
120634	
120635	who gives
120636	God,
120637	to all
120638	generously
120639	
120640	and without
120641	reprimand,
120642	
120643	and it will be given to him.
120644	
120645	he must ask
120646	But
120647	in
120648	faith
120649	without
120650	doubting,
120651	
120652	for
120653	the one who doubts
120654	is like
120655	a wave
120656	of the sea,
120657	blown
120658	
120659	and tossed around by the wind.
120660	must not
120661	For
120662	suppose
120663	
120664	person
120665	that
120666	
120667	that he will receive
120668	anything
120669	from
120670	
120671	the Lord,
120672	individual,
120673	since he is a double-minded
120674	unstable
120675	in
120676	all
120677	
120678	his ways.
120679	
120680	should take pride
120681	Now
120682	
120683	the believer
120684	
120685	of humble means
120686	in
120687	
120688	his high position.
120689	
120690	
120691	But
120692	the rich person’s
120693	pride should be in
120694	
120695	his humiliation,
120696	
120697	
120698	like
120699	a wildflower
120700	in the meadow.
120701	because he will pass away
120702	rises
120703	For
120704	
120705	the sun
120706	with
120707	
120708	its heat
120709	
120710	and dries up
120711	
120712	the meadow;
120713	
120714	
120715	the petal of the flower
120716	
120717	falls off
120718	
120719	
120720	and its beauty
120721	
120722	
120723	
120724	is lost
120725	forever. So
120726	
120727	
120728	also the rich person
120729	in
120730	
120731	the midst of his pursuits
120732	
120733	will wither away.
120734	Happy
120735	is the one
120736	who
120737	endures
120738	testing,
120739	
120740	proven to be genuine,
120741	because when he has
120742	he will receive
120743	
120744	the crown
120745	
120746	of life
120747	that
120748	God promised
120749	
120750	to those who love him.
120751	
120752	no one
120753	say when he is tempted,
120754	Let
120755	
120756	by
120757	God,”
120758	“I am tempted
120759	
120760	for
120761	God
120762	cannot be tempted

120767	
120768	no one.
120769	each one

120772	by
120773	
120774	his own
120775	desires.
120776	when he is lured
120777	
120778	and enticed
120779	Then
120780	
120781	when desire
120782	conceives,

120786	and
120787	when sin
120788	is full grown,
120789	it gives birth

120791	Do not
120792	be led astray,
120793	brothers and sisters.
120794	
120795	my dear
120796	All

120798	generous
120799	
120800	and every
120801	gift

120803	from above,
120804	is
120805	coming down
120806	from
120807	
120808	the Father
120809	
120810	of lights,
120811	with

120813	no
120814	there is

120816	or
120817	the slightest hint
120818	of change.
120819	By his sovereign plan
120820	he gave us
120821	
120822	birth through the message
120823	of truth,
120824	that
120825	
120826	we would be
120827	
120828	of firstfruits
120829	a kind
120830	
120831	
120832	of all he created.
120833	Understand
120834	brothers and sisters!
120835	
120836	this, my dear
120837	be
120838	
120839	Let every
120840	person
120841	quick
120842	to
120843	
120844	listen,
120845	slow
120846	to
120847	
120848	speak,
120849	slow
120850	to
120851	anger.
120852	anger
120853	For
120854	human
120855	righteousness.
120856	God’s
120857	does not
120858	accomplish
120859	So
120860	put away
120861	all
120862	filth
120863	
120864	excess
120865	and evil
120866	
120867	and humbly
120868	welcome
120869	
120870	implanted
120871	the message
120872	
120873	within you, which is able
120874	to save
120875	
120876	your souls.
120877	
120878	be
120879	But
120880	sure you live out
120881	the message
120882	
120883	and do not
120884	merely
120885	listen
120886	to it and so deceive
120887	yourselves.
120888	
120889	For if
120890	someone
120891	merely listens
120892	to the message
120893	
120894	
120895	and does not
120896	live
120897	it out,
120898	he is like
120899	someone
120900	who gazes at
120901	
120902	face
120903	
120904	his own
120905	
120906	in
120907	a mirror.
120908	he gazes at
120909	For
120910	himself
120911	
120912	and then goes out
120913	
120914	and immediately
120915	forgets
120916	what sort of person
120917	he was.
120918	
120919	But
120920	the one who peers
120921	into
120922	law
120923	the perfect
120924	
120925	
120926	of liberty
120927	
120928	and fixes his attention there,
120929	and does not
120930	listener
120931	a forgetful
120932	become
120933	but
120934	one who lives
120935	it out –
120936	
120937	blessed
120938	in
120939	what
120940	does.
120941	he
120942	he will be
120943	If
120944	someone
120945	thinks
120946	religious
120947	he is
120948	yet does not
120949	bridle
120950	his tongue,
120951	
120952	and so
120953	deceives
120954	his heart,
120955	
120956	
120957	is futile.
120958	
120959	his religion
120960	religion
120961	Pure
120962	
120963	and undefiled
120964	before
120965	
120966	God
120967	
120968	the Father
120969	
120970	is this:
120971	to care for
120972	orphans
120973	
120974	and widows
120975	in
120976	
120977	their adversity
120978	
120979	unstained
120980	oneself
120981	and to keep
120982	by
120983	
120984	the world.
120985	My brothers and sisters,
120986	
120987	do not
120988	
120989	show prejudice

121008	in
121009	clothing,
121010	and fine
121011	enters
121012	and

121014	a poor person
121015	
121016	filthy
121017	clothes,
121018	do you pay attention
121019

121031	here
121032	in a good place,”

121043	
121044	the floor”?
121045	
121046	
121047	If so, have you not
121048	made distinctions
121049	among
121050	yourselves
121051	
121052	and become
121053	judges
121054	motives?
121055	with evil
121056	Listen,
121057	brothers and sisters!
121058	
121059	my dear
121060	Did not
121061	
121062	God
121063	choose
121064	
121065	the poor
121066	
121067	in the world
121068	to be rich
121069	in
121070	faith
121071	
121072	and heirs
121073	
121074	of the kingdom
121075	that

121078	to those who love him?

121109	you fulfill
121110	the royal

121112	
121113	this scripture,
121114	“You shall love

121120	well.
121121	you are doing
121122	if
121123	But
121124	you show prejudice,
121125	sin
121126	you are committing
121127	and are convicted
121128	by
121129	
121130	the law
121131	as
121132	violators.
121133	the one who

121136	
121137	law
121138	obeys
121139	fails
121140	but

121151	also said,
121152	
121153	“Do not

121155	if
121156	Now
121157	you do not

121159	do commit murder,
121160	but
121161	you have become

121164	
121165	Speak

121186	What
121187	
121188	good
121189	is it, my brothers and sisters,
121190	
121191	if
121192	faith
121193	claims
121194	someone
121195	to have
121196	works?
121197	but
121198	does not
121199	
121200	have
121201	Can
121202	
121203	this kind of faith
121204	save him?
121205	
121206	If
121207	a brother
121208	or
121209	sister
121210	poorly clothed
121211	is
121212	
121213	and lacks
121214	
121215	
121216	daily
121217	food,
121218	you says to them,
121219	and
121220	one
121221	
121222	of
121223	
121224	“Go
121225	in
121226	peace,
121227	keep warm
121228	
121229	and eat well,”
121230	you do not
121231	give them
121232	but
121233	
121234	
121235	needs,
121236	
121237	what the body
121238	what
121239	
121240	good is it?
121241	So
121242	
121243	
121244	also faith,
121245	if
121246	it does not
121247	have
121248	works,
121249	dead
121250	is
121251	being by
121252	itself.
121253	But
121254	will say,
121255	someone
121256	
121257	faith
121258	“You have
121259	and I
121260	works.”
121261	have
121262	Show me
121263	
121264	
121265	your faith
121266	
121267	without
121268	
121269	works
121270	and I
121271	
121272	will show you
121273	by
121274	
121275	my works.
121276	
121277	
121278	faith
121279	
121280	You believe
121281	
121282	one;
121283	is
121284	
121285	that God
121286	well and good.
121287	
121288	
121289	
121290	Even the demons
121291	believe
121292	
121293	that – and tremble with fear.
121294	would you like
121295	But
121296	evidence,
121297	you
121298	fellow,
121299	empty
121300	
121301	
121302	that faith
121303	without
121304	
121305	works
121306	useless?
121307	is
121308	Abraham
121309	
121310	our father
121311	
121312	Was not
121313	by
121314	works
121315	justified
121316	when he offered
121317	Isaac
121318	
121319	his son
121320	
121321	on
121322	
121323	the altar?
121324	You see
121325	
121326	
121327	that his faith
121328	was working together
121329	
121330	with his works
121331	
121332	
121333	by
121334	
121335	works.
121336	
121337	and his faith
121338	was perfected
121339	
121340	was fulfilled
121341	
121342	And the scripture
121343	
121344	that says,
121345	believed
121346	“Now
121347	Abraham
121348

121359	You see
121360	
121361	by
121362	works
121363	is justified
121364	that a person
121365	
121366	and not
121367	by
121368	faith
121369	alone.
121370	similarly,
121371	And
121372	also
121373	Rahab
121374	
121375	the prostitute
121376	was not
121377	by
121378	works
121379	justified
121380	when she welcomed
121381	
121382	the messengers
121383	
121384	by another
121385	way?
121386	and sent them out
121387	just as

121408	
121409	because you know
121410	
121411	more strictly.
121412	that we will be judged
121413	
121414	in many ways.

121423	stumble
121424	
121425	he is a perfect

121443	to get them
121444	
121445	to obey us,
121446	
121447	
121448	
121449	their entire
121450	
121451	bodies.
121452	
121453	then we guide
121454	Look at
121455	
121456	
121457	ships
121458	so large
121459	too: Though they are
121460	
121461	by
121462	winds,
121463	harsh
121464	and driven
121465	they are steered
121466	by
121467	a tiny
121468	rudder
121469	wherever
121470	
121471	inclination
121472	
121473	the pilot’s
121474	directs.
121475	So
121476	
121477	
121478	too the tongue
121479	a small
121480	part of the body,
121481	is
121482	yet
121483	it has great
121484	pretensions.
121485	Think
121486	how small
121487	a flame
121488	sets a huge
121489	forest
121490	ablaze.
121491	
121492	
121493	And the tongue
121494	is a fire!
121495	
121496	the world
121497	
121498	of wrongdoing
121499	
121500	The tongue
121501	represents
121502	among
121503	
121504	the parts of
121505	our bodies.
121506	
121507	It pollutes
121508	the entire
121509	
121510	body
121511	
121512	and sets fire
121513	
121514	to the course
121515	
121516	of human existence –
121517	
121518	and is set on fire
121519	by
121520	
121521	hell.
121522	every
121523	For
121524	kind
121525	of animal,

121527	
121528	bird,
121529	reptile,
121530	
121531	
121532	and sea creature
121533	is subdued
121534	
121535	and has been subdued
121536	
121537	
121538	
121539	by humankind.
121540	
121541	But
121542	the tongue;
121543	no
121544	subdue
121545	can
121546	human being
121547	it is a restless
121548	evil,
121549	full
121550	poison.
121551	of deadly
121552	With
121553	
121554	it we bless
121555	
121556	the Lord
121557	
121558	and Father,
121559	
121560	and with
121561	
121562	it we curse
121563	
121564	people
121565	
121566	in
121567	image.
121568	God’s

121576	
121577	and cursing.

121583	so,

121592	pour out
121593	
121594	fresh water

121596	
121597	and bitter water

121615	
121616	and understanding

121621	
121622	his good

121671	But
121672	from above
121673	the wisdom
121674	first
121675	
121676	pure,

121689	the fruit
121690	And
121691	that consists of righteousness
121692	in
121693	peace
121694	is planted

121705	come from? Is it not
121706	from this,
121707	from
121708	
121709	your passions
121710	
121711	
121712	that battle
121713	inside you?
121714	
121715	
121716	
121717	You desire
121718	
121719	and you do not
121720	have;
121721	you murder
121722	
121723	and envy
121724	
121725	You do not
121726	and you cannot
121727	obtain;

121738	you ask
121739	
121740	and do not
121741	receive
121742	because
121743	wrongly,
121744	you ask
121745	so

121747	
121748	your passions.
121749	
121750	you can spend

121752	do you not
121753	know
121754	
121755	
121756	that friendship

121764	whoever
121765	So
121766	decides
121767	friend
121768	to be

121770	the world’s
121771	enemy.
121772	
121773	himself God’s
121774	makes
121775	Or
121776	do you think
121777	
121778	means nothing
121779	
121780	the scripture
121781	when it says,
121782	
121783	has an envious
121784	yearning”?
121785	
121786	“The spirit
121787	that
121788	
121789	God caused to live within us

121793	he gives

121823	Cleanse
121824	your hands,
121825	you sinners,
121826	
121827	and make
121828	your hearts
121829	pure, you double-minded.
121830	Grieve,
121831	
121832	mourn,
121833	
121834	and weep.
121835	
121836	Turn your laughter
121837	
121838	into
121839	mourning
121840	
121841	
121842	
121843	and your joy
121844	into
121845	despair.
121846	Humble
121847	yourselves before
121848	
121849	the Lord
121850	
121851	and he will exalt you.
121852	
121853	Do not
121854	speak against
121855	one another,
121856	brothers and sisters.
121857	
121858	He who speaks against
121859	a fellow believer
121860	or
121861	judges
121862	
121863	a fellow believer
121864	
121865	speaks against
121866	the law
121867	
121868	and judges
121869	the law.
121870	if
121871	But
121872	the law,
121873	you judge
121874	not
121875	you are
121876	a doer
121877	of the law
121878	but
121879	its judge.
121880	only one
121881	But there is
121882	who is
121883	lawgiver
121884	
121885	and judge –
121886	
121887	the one who is able
121888	to save
121889	
121890	and destroy.
121891	
121892	On the other hand,
121893	who
121894	are you
121895	
121896	to judge
121897	
121898	your neighbor?
121899	Come
121900	now,
121901	
121902	you who say,
121903	“Today
121904	or
121905	tomorrow
121906	we will go
121907	into
121908	this or that
121909	
121910	town
121911	
121912	and spend
121913	there
121914	a year
121915	
121916	and do business
121917	
121918	and make a profit.”
121919	You
121920	do not
121921	know
121922	
121923	
121924	about tomorrow.
121925	What
121926	
121927	is your life
121928	
121929	a puff of smoke
121930	like? For
121931	you are
121932	
121933	for
121934	a short time
121935	that appears
121936	and then
121937	
121938	vanishes.
121939	instead,
121940	
121941	You ought to say
121942	
121943	“If
121944	
121945	the Lord
121946	is willing,
121947	
121948	then we will live
121949	
121950	and do
121951	
121952	this or
121953	that.”
121954	as it is,
121955	But
121956	you boast
121957	
121958	
121959	about your arrogant plans.
121960	
121961	All
121962	boasting
121963	such
121964	evil.
121965	is
121966	whoever knows
121967	So
121968	what is good
121969	to do
121970	
121971	and does not
121972	do
121973	guilty of sin.
121974	
121975	it is
121976	Come
121977	now,
121978	
121979	you rich!
121980	Weep
121981	and cry aloud
121982	over
121983	
121984	the miseries
121985	
121986	
121987	that are coming on you.
121988	
121989	Your riches
121990	
121991	have rotted
121992	
121993	
121994	and your clothing
121995	
121996	moth-eaten.
121997	has become
121998	
121999	Your gold
122000	
122001	
122002	
122003	and silver
122004	have rusted
122005	
122006	
122007	and their rust
122008	
122009	
122010	a witness against you.
122011	
122012	will be
122013	
122014	It will consume
122015	
122016	your flesh
122017	
122018	like
122019	fire.
122020	that you have hoarded treasure!
122021	It is in
122022	the last
122023	days
122024	Look,
122025	
122026	the pay
122027	
122028	from the workers
122029	
122030	who mowed
122031	
122032	your fields
122033	
122034	
122035	you have held back
122036	against you,
122037	
122038	cries out
122039	
122040	
122041	and the cries
122042	
122043	of the reapers
122044	
122045	
122046	the ears
122047	of the Lord
122048	of Heaven’s Armies.
122049	have reached
122050	You have lived indulgently
122051	on
122052	
122053	the earth.
122054	
122055	and luxuriously
122056	You have fattened
122057	
122058	your hearts
122059	
122060	in
122061	a day
122062	of slaughter.
122063	You have condemned
122064	and murdered
122065	
122066	the righteous person,
122067	although he does not
122068	resist you.
122069	
122070	be patient,
122071	So
122072	brothers and sisters,
122073	until
122074	
122075	return.
122076	
122077	the Lord’s
122078	Think of how
122079	
122080	the farmer
122081	waits
122082	
122083	for the precious
122084	fruit
122085	
122086	of the ground
122087	and is patient
122088	for it
122089	
122090	until
122091	it receives
122092	the early
122093	
122094	and late rains.
122095	You also be patient
122096	
122097	
122098	and strengthen
122099	
122100	your hearts,

122102	
122103	
122104	return
122105	
122106	for the Lord’s
122107	is near.
122108	Do not
122109	grumble
122110	brothers and sisters,
122111	against
122112	one another,
122113	so that
122114	you may not
122115	be judged.
122116	See,
122117	
122118	the judge
122119	before
122120	
122121	the gates!
122122	stands
122123	As an example
122124	take
122125	brothers and sisters,
122126	
122127	of suffering
122128	
122129	
122130	and patience,
122131	
122132	the prophets
122133	who
122134	spoke
122135	in
122136	
122137	name.
122138	the Lord’s
122139	Think of how
122140	we regard as blessed
122141	
122142	those who have endured.

122562	your ignorance,

122594	each one’s
122595	work,

122627	He was foreknown
122628	
122629	before
122630	the foundation
122631	of the world
122632	was manifested
122633	but

122635	these last
122636	
122637	times
122638	for your sake.

122664	
122665	your souls

122707	withers
122708	
122709	the grass
122710	
122711	
122712	and the flower
122713	falls off,
122714	
122715	but

122756	it you may grow up
122757	to

122759	if

122776	God’s sight,
122777	chosen
122778	and precious

122797	Christ.
122798	For
122799	it says
122800	in
122801	scripture,
122802	“Look,
122803	I lay

122837	and a stumbling-stone
122838	
122839	
122840	and a rock

122842	
122843	They stumble

122845	the word,
122846	because they disobey
122847	
122848	
122849	
122850	as they were destined to do.
122851	
122852	But you
122853	race,
122854	are a chosen
122855	a royal
122856	priesthood,
122857	nation,
122858	a holy
122859	a people
122860	into
122861	of his own,
122862	so that
122863	
122864	the virtues
122865	you may proclaim
122866	
122867	of
122868	out of darkness
122869	
122870	the one who called you
122871	
122872	
122873	his marvelous
122874	
122875	light.
122876	
122877	You once
122878	were not
122879	a people,
122880	now
122881	but
122882	people.
122883	you are God’s
122884	
122885	You were shown no
122886	mercy,
122887	now
122888	but
122889	you have received mercy.
122890	Dear friends,
122891	I urge
122892	you as
122893	foreigners
122894	
122895	and exiles
122896	to keep away
122897	
122898	from fleshly
122899	desires
122900	that
122901	do battle
122902	against
122903	
122904	the soul,
122905	
122906	conduct
122907	
122908	among
122909	
122910	the non-Christians,
122911	and maintain
122912	good
122913	so that
122914	though
122915	
122916	they now malign you
122917	
122918	as
122919	wrongdoers,
122920	
122921	
122922	your good
122923	deeds
122924	they may see
122925	and glorify
122926	
122927	God
122928	
122929	when
122930	he appears.
122931	Be subject
122932	to every
122933	human
122934	institution
122935	for
122936	
122937	the Lord’s
122938	sake, whether
122939	to a king
122940	as
122941	supreme
122942	or
122943	to governors
122944	as

122960	For God
122961	by doing good.
122962	you to silence
122963	
122964	
122965	of foolish
122966	people
122967	the ignorance
122968	as
122969	free people,
122970	
122971	not
122972	as
122973	a pretext
122974	Live
122975	
122976	for evil,
122977	
122978	using your freedom
122979	but
122980	as
122981	God’s
122982	slaves.
122983	all people,

122994	
122995	Slaves,
122996	be subject
122997	with
122998	all
122999	reverence,
123000	
123001	to your masters
123002	not
123003	only
123004	
123005	to those who are good
123006	
123007	and gentle,
123008	but
123009	
123010	
123011	also to those who are perverse.
123012	
123013	For
123014	this finds God’s favor,
123015	if
123016	because
123017	of conscience
123018	toward God
123019	endures
123020	someone
123021	hardships
123022	in suffering
123023	unjustly.
123024	what
123025	For
123026	credit
123027	is it if
123028	you sin
123029	
123030	and are mistreated
123031	and endure
123032	it? But
123033	if
123034	you do good
123035	
123036	and suffer
123037	and so endure,
123038	
123039	this finds favor
123040	with
123041	God.
123042	to
123043	
123044	For
123045	this you were called,
123046	
123047	
123048	since Christ
123049	also suffered
123050	for you,
123051	
123052	
123053	leaving
123054	an example for you
123055	to
123056	follow
123057	
123058	in his steps.
123059	
123060	He
123061	sin
123062	no
123063	committed
123064	nor
123065	found
123066	was deceit
123067	in
123068	
123069	his mouth.
123070	
123071	When he
123072	was maligned,
123073	he did not
123074	answer back;
123075	when he suffered,
123076	no
123077	he threatened
123078	committed
123079	retaliation, but
123080	
123081	himself to God who judges
123082	justly.
123083	He himself
123084	
123085	our sins
123086	
123087	
123088	bore
123089	in
123090	
123091	his body
123092	
123093	on
123094	
123095	the tree,
123096	that
123097	
123098	from sinning
123099	we may cease
123100	
123101	for righteousness.
123102	and live
123103	
123104	
123105	By his wounds
123106	you were healed.
123107	you were
123108	For
123109	like
123110	sheep
123111	going astray
123112	but
123113	you have turned back
123114	now
123115	to
123116	
123117	the shepherd
123118	
123119	and guardian
123120	
123121	of your souls.
123122	
123123	In the same way,
123124	
123125	wives,
123126	be subject
123127	
123128	to your own
123129	husbands.
123130	Then,
123131	
123132	even if
123133	some
123134	are disobedient
123135	
123136	to the word,
123137	by
123138	
123139	
123140	you live,
123141	the way
123142	without
123143	a word
123144	they will be won over
123145	when they see
123146	
123147	
123148	and reverent
123149	your pure
123150	conduct.
123151	
123152	Let your
123153	be
123154	beauty not
123155	
123156	external –
123157	the braiding
123158	of hair
123159	
123160	and wearing
123161	of gold
123162	jewelry or
123163	
123164	clothes –
123165	fine
123166	but
123167	
123168	the inner
123169	
123170	of the heart,
123171	person
123172	
123173	
123174	the lasting beauty
123175	
123176	of a gentle
123177	
123178	and tranquil
123179	spirit,
123180	which
123181	is
123182	in
123183	
123184	God’s sight.
123185	precious
123186	in the same way
123187	For
123188	long ago
123189	
123190	
123191	the holy
123192	women
123193	
123194	who hoped
123195	in
123196	God
123197	adorned
123198	themselves
123199	by being subject
123200	
123201	to their
123202	husbands,
123203	like
123204	Sarah
123205	who obeyed
123206	
123207	Abraham,
123208	lord.
123209	
123210	calling him
123211	her
123212	You become
123213	children
123214	when you do what is good
123215	
123216	and have no
123217	fear
123218	
123219	in doing so.
123220	
123221	Husbands,
123222	in the same way,
123223	treat
123224	with
123225	consideration
123226	as
123227	the weaker
123228	partners
123229	
123230	your wives
123231	and show
123232	them honor
123233	as
123234	
123235	fellow heirs
123236	of the grace
123237	of life.
123238	In this way
123239	
123240	nothing
123241	will hinder
123242	
123243	your prayers.
123244	
123245	
123246	
123247	Finally,
123248	all
123249	of you be harmonious,
123250	sympathetic,
123251	affectionate,
123252	compassionate, and humble.
123253	
123254	Do not
123255	return
123256	evil
123257	for
123258	evil
123259	or
123260	insult
123261	for
123262	insult,
123263	instead
123264	but
123265	bless
123266	
123267	
123268	
123269	others because you were called
123270	to
123271	a blessing.
123272	inherit
123273	
123274	For
123275	the one who wants
123276	life
123277	to love
123278	
123279	and see
123280	days
123281	good
123282	must keep
123283	
123284	his tongue
123285	from
123286	evil
123287	
123288	and his lips
123289	
123290	from
123291	uttering
123292	deceit.
123293	he must turn away
123294	And
123295	from
123296	evil
123297	
123298	and do
123299	good;
123300	he must seek
123301	peace
123302	
123303	and pursue it.
123304	
123305	
123306	For the eyes
123307	of the Lord
123308	are upon
123309	the righteous
123310	
123311	and his ears
123312	
123313	are open to
123314	their prayer.
123315	
123316	face
123317	But
123318	the Lord’s
123319	is against
123320	those who do
123321	evil.
123322	
123323	For who
123324	
123325	is going to harm you
123326	
123327	if
123328	
123329	to what is good?
123330	devoted
123331	you are
123332	But
123333	in fact, if
123334	
123335	you happen to suffer
123336	for
123337	doing what is right,
123338	you are blessed.
123339	
123340	But
123341	
123342	
123343	do not
123344	be terrified of them
123345	or
123346	be shaken.
123347	as Lord
123348	But
123349	
123350	set Christ
123351	apart
123352	in
123353	
123354	your hearts
123355	
123356	be ready
123357	and always
123358	to
123359	give an answer
123360	to anyone
123361	
123362	who asks
123363	
123364	
123365	about
123366	
123367	possess.
123368	
123369	the hope you
123370	Yet
123371	do it with
123372	courtesy
123373	
123374	and respect,
123375	conscience,
123376	keeping
123377	a good
123378	so that
123379	in
123380	
123381	when they accuse you.
123382	may be put to shame
123383	
123384	those who slander
123385	
123386	
123387	your good
123388	
123389	Christ
123390	conduct
123391	it is better
123392	For
123393	for doing good,
123394	if
123395	wills
123396	
123397	
123398	
123399	God
123400	to suffer
123401	it, than
123402	for doing evil.
123403	
123404	
123405	 Because Christ
123406	once
123407	for
123408	sins,
123409	also suffered
123410	the just
123411	for
123412	the unjust,
123413	to
123414	
123415	bring you
123416	
123417	to God,
123418	by being put to death
123419	
123420	in the flesh
123421	by being made alive
123422	but
123423	in the spirit.
123424	In
123425	
123426	
123427	
123428	in
123429	prison,
123430	to the spirits
123431	it he went
123432	and preached
123433	after they were disobedient
123434	long ago
123435	when
123436	waited
123437	
123438	
123439	God
123440	patiently
123441	in
123442	the days
123443	of Noah
123444	was being constructed.
123445	as an ark
123446	In
123447	the ark
123448	a few,
123449	
123450	that is
123451	eight
123452	souls,
123453	were delivered
123454	through
123455	water.
123456	which
123457	
123458	
123459	And this prefigured
123460	now
123461	saves you –
123462	baptism,
123463	not
123464	of physical
123465	the washing off
123466	dirt
123467	but
123468	conscience
123469	of a good
123470	the pledge
123471	to
123472	God –
123473	through
123474	the resurrection
123475	of Jesus
123476	Christ,
123477	who
123478	and is
123479	at
123480	the right hand
123481	
123482	of God
123483	went
123484	into
123485	heaven
123486	subject to him.
123487	
123488	with angels
123489	
123490	and authorities
123491	
123492	and powers
123493	since Christ
123494	So,
123495	suffered
123496	in the flesh,
123497	
123498	
123499	
123500	
123501	yourselves with the same attitude,
123502	you also arm
123503	
123504	
123505	because the one who has suffered
123506	in the flesh
123507	has finished
123508	with sin,
123509	in
123510	
123511	and not

123514	
123515	concerned about the will

123519	on
123520	earth
123521	that he spends
123522	of his time
123523	was sufficient
123524	For
123525	
123526	that has passed
123527	the time
123528	
123529	desire.
123530	
123531	what the non-Christians
123532	for you to do
123533	You lived
123534	then in
123535	debauchery,
123536	evil desires,
123537	drunkenness,
123538	carousing,
123539	drinking bouts,
123540	
123541	and wanton
123542	idolatries.
123543	
123544	So
123545	they are astonished when you
123546	do not
123547	rush with
123548	
123549	them into
123550	
123551	
123552	
123553	of wickedness,
123554	the same flood
123555	and they vilify you.
123556	They
123557	will face
123558	a reckoning
123559	
123560	ready
123561	before Jesus Christ who stands
123562	to judge
123563	the living
123564	
123565	and the dead.
123566	it was for
123567	this very purpose that
123568	Now
123569	
123570	to those who are now dead,
123571	the gospel was preached
123572	so that
123573	they were judged
123574	though

123579	
123580	by
123581	God’s standards.
123582	spiritually
123583	of all things
123584	For
123585	
123586	the culmination
123587	is near.
123588	be self-controlled

123599	your love
123600	fervent,
123601	keep

123608	to
123609	one another

123670	by fire
123671	
123672	that a trial
123673	
123674	is occurring
123675	as though
123676	something strange
123677	
123678	were happening to you.
123679	But
123680	in the degree
123681	that you have shared
123682	
123683	
123684	of Christ,
123685	in the sufferings
123686	rejoice
123687	so that
123688	
123689	
123690	
123691	is revealed
123692	
123693	when his glory
123694	
123695	you may also rejoice
123696	and be glad.
123697	If
123698	you are insulted
123699	for
123700	the name
123701	of Christ,
123702	you are blessed,
123703	
123704

123716	But
123717	let none
123718	
123719	of you suffer
123720	as
123721	a murderer
123722	or
123723	thief
123724	or
123725	criminal
123726	or
123727	as
123728	a troublemaker.
123729	if
123730	But
123731	you suffer as
123732	a Christian,
123733	do not
123734	be ashamed,
123735	glorify

123741	that you bear such a name.
123742	
123743	
123744	
123745	For it is time
123746	
123747	to begin,
123748	
123749	for judgment
123750	starting with
123751	
123752	the house

123766	
123767	of God?
123768	to the gospel

123770	And if
123771	
123772	the righteous
123773	are barely
123774	saved,
123775	
123776	of the ungodly
123777	
123778	and sinners?
123779	what
123780	will become
123781	So
123782	
123783	
123784	then let those who suffer

124240	removed,
124241	
124242	that my tabernacle
124243	
124244	because
124245	
124246	
124247	our Lord
124248	
124249	Jesus
124250	Christ
124251	revealed this to me.
124252	
124253	I will also make every effort
124254	Indeed,
124255	
124256	
124257	you have
124258	
124259	that, after
124260	
124261	my
124262	departure,
124263	
124264	
124265	a testimony of these things.
124266	
124267	we did not
124268	For
124269	cleverly concocted
124270	fables
124271	follow
124272	when we made known to you
124273	
124274	
124275	
124276	of our Lord
124277	
124278	Jesus
124279	Christ;
124280	the power
124281	
124282	and return
124283	no,
124284	eyewitnesses
124285	we were
124286	
124287	of his
124288	grandeur.
124289	he received
124290	For
124291	from
124292	God
124293	the Father,
124294	honor
124295	
124296	and glory
124297	voice
124298	was conveyed to him
124299	
124300	when that
124301	by
124302	
124303	the Majestic
124304	Glory:
124305	
124306	Son,
124307	
124308	
124309	my dear
124310	
124311	
124312	“This is
124313	in
124314	whom
124315	
124316	I am delighted.”
124317	
124318	
124319	
124320	When this voice
124321	
124322	we ourselves heard
124323	from
124324	heaven,
124325	was conveyed
124326	with him
124327	
124328	it, for we were
124329	on
124330	
124331	the holy
124332	mountain.
124333	
124334	Moreover, we possess
124335	as an altogether reliable thing.
124336	
124337	the prophetic
124338	word
124339	
124340	well
124341	You do
124342	if you pay attention
124343	to this as
124344	you would to a light
124345	shining
124346	in
124347	a murky
124348	place,
124349	until
124350	
124351	the day
124352	
124353	
124354	dawns and the morning star
124355	rises
124356	in
124357	
124358	your hearts.
124359	
124360	
124361	Above all,
124362	you do well if you recognize this:
124363	
124364	
124365	prophecy
124366	of scripture
124367	by the prophet’s own
124368	imagination,
124369	No
124370	ever comes about
124371	no
124372	for
124373	impulse;
124374	of human
124375	borne
124376	prophecy
124377	was ever
124378	rather,
124379	by
124380	Spirit
124381	the Holy
124382	carried along
124383	spoke
124384	from
124385	God.
124386	men
124387	arose
124388	But
124389	
124390	false prophets
124391	among
124392	
124393	the people,
124394	just as
124395	
124396	among you.
124397	
124398	there will be
124399	false teachers
124400	These false teachers
124401	will infiltrate
124402	heresies,
124403	your midst with destructive

124406	who bought them.
124407	
124408	the Master
124409	even to the point of denying
124410	As a result, they will bring
124411	on themselves.
124412	swift
124413	destruction
124414	
124415	And many
124416	will follow
124417	
124418	
124419	their debauched lifestyles.
124420	Because of
124421	these false teachers,
124422	
124423	the way
124424	
124425	of truth
124426	will be slandered.
124427	
124428	And in
124429	their greed
124430	with deceptive
124431	words.
124432	
124433	they will exploit you
124434	Their
124435	
124436	condemnation
124437	pronounced long ago
124438	is not
124439	sitting idly by;
124440	
124441	
124442	their destruction
124443	
124444	is not
124445	asleep.
124446	if
124447	For
124448	
124449	God
124450	the angels
124451	who sinned,
124452	did not
124453	spare
124454	but
124455	in chains
124456	in utter darkness,
124457	threw them into hell
124458	and locked them up
124459	until
124460	the judgment,
124461	to be kept
124462	
124463	the ancient
124464	world,
124465	and if he did not
124466	spare
124467	but
124468	along with seven others,
124469	Noah,
124470	of righteousness,
124471	a herald
124472	did protect
124473	a flood
124474	world,
124475	on an ungodly
124476	when God brought
124477	
124478	the cities
124479	of Sodom
124480	
124481	and Gomorrah
124482	and if he turned to ashes
124483	them to destruction,
124484	when he condemned
124485	them to serve as an example
124486	to future generations
124487	of the ungodly,
124488	having appointed
124489	
124490	a righteous man
124491	Lot,
124492	in anguish
124493	over
124494	
124495	
124496	of lawless men,
124497	
124498	the debauched
124499	lifestyle
124500	and if he rescued
124501	he saw
124502	(for
124503	
124504	and heard)
124505	
124506	that righteous man

124511	after
124512	day,

124515	by the lawless
124516	deeds
124517	was tormented

124519	– if so, then the Lord
124520	the godly
124521	from
124522	their trials,
124523	how to rescue
124524	the unrighteous
124525	and
124526	at
124527	the day
124528	of judgment,
124529	for punishment
124530	to reserve
124531	especially

124533	
124534	
124535	their fleshly
124536	
124537	desires
124538	those who indulge
124539	
124540	
124541	authority.
124542	and who despise
124543	Brazen
124544	and insolent,
124545	the glorious ones,
124546	they are not
124547	afraid
124548	to insult
124549	
124550	yet even angels,

124565	But
124566	these men, like
124567	irrational
124568	animals –
124569	born
124570	creatures of instinct,
124571	to
124572	be caught
124573	
124574	and destroyed –
124575	and consequently in
124576	whom
124577	do not understand
124578	they are insulting,
124579	
124580	
124581	their destruction
124582	
124583	
124584	they will be destroyed,

124600	their deceitful pleasures

124602	when they feast together with you.

124620	By forsaking
124621	the right
124622	path
124623	they have gone astray,

124743	
124744	
124745	
124746	of this true

124751	
124752	its own
124753	vomit,”

124760	
124761	this is already
124762	Dear friends,
124763	the second
124764	
124765	I have written you,
124766	letter
124767	in
124768	which
124769	I am trying to stir up
124770	
124771	by way of
124772	reminder:
124773	
124774	your pure
124775	mind
124776	I want you to recall
124777	
124778	foretold
124779	both the predictions
124780	by
124781	
124782	the holy
124783	prophets
124784	
124785	
124786	
124787	through your apostles.
124788	
124789	and the commandment
124790	
124791	of the Lord
124792	
124793	and Savior
124794	
124795	Above all,
124796	understand this:
124797	
124798	will come,
124799	In
124800	the last
124801	
124802	days
124803	
124804	
124805	blatant scoffers
124806	by
124807	
124808	their own
124809	evil urges
124810	
124811	being propelled
124812	
124813	and saying,
124814	“Where
124815	is
124816	
124817	his promised
124818	
124819	return?
124820	
124821	they were from
124822	ever since
124823	For
124824	
124825	our ancestors
124826	died,
124827	all things
124828	as
124829	have continued
124830	
124831	the beginning
124832	of creation.”
124833	suppress
124834	For
124835	
124836	
124837	they deliberately
124838	
124839	heavens
124840	existed
124841	long ago
124842	
124843	and an earth
124844	out of
124845	water
124846	
124847	and by means of
124848	water.
124849	was formed
124850	
124851	
124852	of God
124853	this fact, that by the word
124854	Through
124855	these things
124856	
124857	existing at that time
124858	the world
124859	with water.
124860	when it was deluged
124861	was destroyed
124862	
124863	But
124864	the present
124865	heavens
124866	
124867	
124868	and earth
124869	
124870	
124871	by the same word
124872	have been reserved
124873	
124874	for fire,
124875	by being kept
124876	for
124877	the day
124878	of judgment
124879	
124880	and destruction
124881	
124882	of the ungodly.
124883	
124884	let this one thing
124885	Now,
124886	
124887	do not
124888	escape
124889	your notice,
124890	dear friends,
124891	
124892	that a single
124893	day
124894	with
124895	the Lord
124896	is like
124897	a thousand
124898	years
124899	
124900	and a thousand
124901	years
124902	are like
124903	day.
124904	a single
124905	is not
124906	slow
124907	The Lord
124908	
124909	concerning his promise,

124911	some
124912	slowness,
124913	regard
124914	but
124915	is being patient
124916	toward you,
124917	
124918	because he does not
124919	wish
124920	for any
124921	to perish
124922	but
124923	for all
124924	to
124925	repentance.
124926	to come
124927	will come
124928	But
124929	the day
124930	of the Lord
124931	like
124932	a thief;
124933	done on
124934	
124935	
124936	when it comes, the heavens
124937	with a horrific noise,
124938	will disappear
124939	the celestial bodies
124940	and
124941	in a blaze,
124942	will melt away
124943	
124944	and the earth
124945	
124946	
124947	
124948	
124949	and every deed
124950	
124951	it will be laid bare.
124952	
124953	in this manner,
124954	Since all
124955	these things are to melt away
124956	what sort of
124957	people must
124958	we be,
124959	
124960	our lives in
124961	holiness
124962	conducting
124963	
124964	and godliness,
124965	while waiting for
124966	
124967	and hastening
124968	
124969	the coming
124970	
124971	
124972	of God?
124973	of the day
124974	Because of
124975	this day,
124976	the heavens
124977	will be burned up
124978	and dissolve,
124979	
124980	and the celestial bodies
124981	in a blaze!
124982	will melt away
124983	new
124984	But,
124985	heavens
124986	
124987	earth,
124988	and a new
124989	according to
124990	
124991	his promise,
124992	
124993	we are waiting for
124994	in
124995	which
124996	righteousness
124997	truly resides.
124998	Therefore,
124999	dear friends,
125000	
125001	since you are waiting for
125002	these things, strive
125003	without spot
125004	
125005	or blemish, when you come into his presence.
125006	
125007	to be found
125008	at
125009	peace,
125010	
125011	
125012	
125013	of our Lord
125014	
125015	the patience
125016	as salvation,
125017	And regard
125018	just as
125019	also
125020	
125021	our dear
125022	
125023	brother
125024	Paul
125025	according to
125026	
125027	given
125028	to him,
125029	the wisdom
125030	wrote to you,
125031	
125032	as
125033	
125034	of these things in
125035	all
125036	
125037	his letters.
125038	speaking
125039	in
125040	
125041	
125042	
125043	
125044	these letters
125045	are
125046	hard to understand,
125047	Some things
125048	
125049	
125050	things the ignorant
125051	
125052	and unstable
125053	twist
125054	
125055	
125056	
125057	they also do to the rest
125058	of the scriptures.
125059	to
125060	
125061	their own
125062	
125063	destruction,
125064	
125065	Therefore,
125066	dear friends,
125067	since you have been forewarned,
125068	be on
125069	your guard that
125070	you do not
125071	
125072	
125073	of these unprincipled men
125074	by the error
125075	get led astray
125076	and fall
125077	
125078	from your
125079	firm grasp on the truth.
125080	grow
125081	But
125082	in
125083	the grace
125084	
125085	and knowledge
125086	
125087	of our Lord
125088	
125089	
125090	and Savior
125091	Jesus
125092	Christ.
125093	
125094	
125095	To him be the honor
125096	
125097	both now
125098	
125099	and on
125100	day.
125101	that eternal
125102	This is what
125103	was
125104	from
125105	the beginning,
125106	we proclaim to you: what
125107	we have heard,
125108	what
125109	we have seen
125110	
125111	with our eyes,
125112	
125113	what
125114	what we have looked at
125115	
125116	
125117	and our hands
125118	
125119	have touched
125120	(concerning
125121	
125122	the word
125123	
125124	of life –
125125	
125126	
125127	and the life
125128	was revealed,
125129	
125130	and we have seen
125131	
125132	and testify
125133	
125134	and announce to you
125135	
125136	
125137	life
125138	
125139	the eternal
125140	that
125141	was
125142	with
125143	
125144	the Father
125145	
125146	and was revealed to us).
125147	
125148	What
125149	we have seen
125150	
125151	and heard
125152	we announce to you
125153	
125154	
125155	too, so that
125156	
125157	
125158	fellowship
125159	you may have
125160	with us
125161	
125162	
125163	
125164	fellowship
125165	(and indeed
125166	
125167	our
125168	is with
125169	
125170	the Father
125171	
125172	and with
125173	
125174	his Son
125175	
125176	Jesus
125177	Christ).
125178	
125179	
125180	Thus we are writing
125181	
125182	these things so that
125183	
125184	our joy
125185	
125186	may be
125187	complete.
125188	
125189	Now this is
125190	
125191	
125192	the gospel message
125193	
125194	we have heard
125195	from him
125196	
125197	
125198	and announce to you:
125199	
125200	
125201	
125202	God
125203	light,
125204	is
125205	
125206	darkness
125207	and in him
125208	
125209	no
125210	there is
125211	at all.
125212	If
125213	we say
125214	
125215	fellowship
125216	we have
125217	with him
125218	
125219	
125220	in
125221	
125222	the darkness,
125223	and yet keep on walking
125224	we are lying
125225	
125226	and not
125227	practicing
125228	
125229	the truth.
125230	But if
125231	in
125232	
125233	the light
125234	we walk
125235	as he himself
125236	
125237	is
125238	in
125239	
125240	the light,
125241	fellowship
125242	we have
125243	with
125244	one another
125245	
125246	
125247	and the blood
125248	of Jesus
125249	
125250	his Son
125251	
125252	cleanses us
125253	
125254	from
125255	all
125256	sin.
125257	If
125258	we say
125259	
125260	the guilt of sin,
125261	we do not
125262	bear
125263	ourselves
125264	we are deceiving
125265	
125266	
125267	and the truth
125268	not
125269	is
125270	in us.
125271	
125272	But if
125273	we confess
125274	
125275	our sins,
125276	
125277	faithful
125278	he is
125279	
125280	and righteous,
125281	
125282	forgiving us
125283	
125284	
125285	our sins
125286	
125287	and cleansing us
125288	
125289	from
125290	all
125291	unrighteousness.
125292	If
125293	we say
125294	
125295	we have not
125296	sinned,
125297	a liar
125298	we make him
125299	
125300	
125301	
125302	and his word
125303	
125304	not
125305	is
125306	in us.
125307	
125308	(My little children,
125309	
125310	
125311	I am writing
125312	
125313	these things to you so that you
125314	may not
125315	sin.)
125316	
125317	But if
125318	anyone
125319	does sin,
125320	an advocate
125321	we have
125322	with
125323	
125324	the Father,
125325	Jesus
125326	Christ
125327	the Righteous One,
125328	and
125329	he himself
125330	the atoning sacrifice
125331	is
125332	for
125333	
125334	sins,
125335	our
125336	and not
125337	for
125338	
125339	our sins
125340	
125341	only
125342	but
125343	
125344	also for
125345	whole
125346	the
125347	world.
125348	
125349	Now by
125350	
125351	this we know
125352	
125353	that we have come to know
125354	
125355	God: if
125356	
125357	his commandments.
125358	
125359	we keep
125360	
125361	The one who says
125362	
125363	“I have come to know
125364	
125365	
125366	
125367	keep his commandments
125368	
125369	not
125370	God” and yet does
125371	a liar,
125372	is
125373	
125374	in such a person.
125375	
125376	
125377	and the truth
125378	not
125379	is
125380	
125381	But
125382	whoever
125383	obeys
125384	
125385	
125386	his word,
125387	truly
125388	in
125389	
125390	
125391	this person the love
125392	
125393	of God
125394	has been perfected.
125395	By
125396	
125397	this we know
125398	
125399	in him.
125400	
125401	that we are
125402	
125403	The one who says
125404	in
125405	
125406	he resides
125407	God ought himself
125408	just as
125409	Jesus
125410	to walk
125411	
125412	
125413	
125414	walked.
125415	Dear friends,
125416	I am not
125417	commandment to you,
125418	a new
125419	writing
125420	
125421	but
125422	commandment
125423	an old
125424	which
125425	you have had
125426	from
125427	the beginning.
125428	
125429	commandment
125430	
125431	The old
125432	is
125433	
125434	the word
125435	that
125436	you have already heard.
125437	On the other hand,
125438	commandment to you
125439	a new
125440	I am writing
125441	
125442	which
125443	is
125444	true
125445	in him
125446	
125447	
125448	and in you,
125449	
125450	
125451	
125452	because the darkness
125453	is passing away
125454	
125455	
125456	light
125457	
125458	and the true
125459	already shining.
125460	is
125461	
125462	The one who says
125463	in
125464	
125465	the light
125466	he is
125467	
125468	
125469	his fellow Christian
125470	
125471	but still hates
125472	in
125473	
125474	the darkness.
125475	is
125476	
125477	still
125478	
125479	The one who loves
125480	
125481	his fellow Christian
125482	
125483	in
125484	
125485	the light,
125486	resides
125487	
125488	cause for stumbling
125489	in him.
125490	
125491	no
125492	and there is
125493	
125494	But
125495	the one who hates
125496	
125497	his fellow Christian
125498	
125499	in
125500	
125501	the darkness,
125502	is
125503	
125504	in
125505	
125506	the darkness,
125507	walks
125508	
125509	and does not
125510	know
125511	where
125512	he is going,
125513	
125514	
125515	because the darkness
125516	has blinded
125517	
125518	his eyes.
125519	
125520	I am writing to you,
125521	
125522	little children,
125523	
125524	have been forgiven
125525	
125526	
125527	that your sins
125528	because of
125529	
125530	his name.
125531	
125532	I am writing to you,
125533	
125534	fathers,
125535	
125536	that you have known
125537	
125538	him who has been from
125539	the beginning.
125540	I am writing to you,
125541	
125542	young people,
125543	
125544	that you have conquered
125545	
125546	the evil one.
125547	I have written to you,
125548	
125549	children,
125550	
125551	that you have known
125552	
125553	the Father.
125554	I have written to you,
125555	
125556	fathers,
125557	
125558	that you have known
125559	
125560	him who has been from
125561	the beginning.
125562	I have written to you,
125563	
125564	young people,
125565	
125566	strong,
125567	that you are
125568	
125569	
125570	and the word
125571	
125572	of God
125573	in you,
125574	
125575	resides
125576	
125577	and you have conquered
125578	
125579	the evil one.
125580	Do not
125581	love
125582	
125583	the world
125584	or
125585	
125586	the things in
125587	
125588	the world.
125589	If
125590	anyone
125591	loves
125592	
125593	the world,
125594	not
125595	is
125596	
125597	the love
125598	
125599	of the Father
125600	in him,
125601	
125602	
125603	because all
125604	
125605	that is in
125606	
125607	the world
125608	
125609	(the desire
125610	
125611	of the flesh
125612	
125613	
125614	and the desire
125615	
125616	of the eyes
125617	
125618	
125619	and the arrogance
125620	
125621	produced by material possessions)
125622	not
125623	is
125624	from
125625	
125626	the Father,
125627	but
125628	from
125629	
125630	the world.
125631	is
125632	
125633	
125634	And the world
125635	is passing away
125636	
125637	
125638	with all its desires,
125639	
125640	
125641	but
125642	the person who does
125643	
125644	the will
125645	
125646	of God
125647	remains
125648	
125649	
125650	forever.
125651	Children,
125652	the last
125653	hour,

125655	
125656	and just as
125657	you heard
125658	
125659	that the antichrist
125660	is coming,
125661	
125662	so now
125663	antichrists
125664	many
125665	have appeared.
125666	from this
125667	We know
125668	
125669	the last
125670	hour.
125671	that it is
125672	from us,
125673	
125674	They went out
125675	but
125676	not
125677	they did
125678	really belong
125679	to us,
125680	if
125681	because
125682	belonged
125683	to us,
125684	they had
125685	they would have remained
125686	
125687	with us.
125688	
125689	But
125690	they went out from us to
125691	demonstrate
125692	
125693	not
125694	of them do
125695	that all
125696	belong to us.
125697

125700	an anointing
125701	Nevertheless you have

125707	all know.
125708	I have not
125709	written to you
125710	
125711	
125712	that you do not
125713	know
125714	
125715	the truth,
125716	but
125717	
125718	that you do know it,
125719	
125720	
125721	
125722	
125723	lie
125724	of
125725	
125726	the truth.
125727	and that no
125728	is
125729	Who
125730	is
125731	
125732	the liar
125733	
125734	but
125735	
125736	the person who denies
125737	
125738	that Jesus
125739	
125740	is
125741	
125742	the Christ?
125743	
125744	This one is
125745	
125746	the antichrist:
125747	
125748	the person who denies
125749	
125750	the Father
125751	
125752	
125753	and the Son.
125754	Everyone
125755	
125756	who denies
125757	
125758	the Son
125759	does not
125760	
125761	the Father either.
125762	have
125763	The person who
125764	confesses
125765	
125766	the Son
125767	
125768	
125769	the Father also.
125770	has
125771	
125772	As for you, what
125773	you have heard
125774	from
125775	the beginning
125776	in you.
125777	
125778	must remain
125779	If
125780	in you,
125781	
125782	remains
125783	what
125784	from
125785	the beginning
125786	you heard
125787	
125788	
125789	in
125790	
125791	the Son
125792	
125793	and in
125794	
125795	the Father.
125796	you also will remain
125797	
125798	
125799	Now this is
125800	
125801	the promise
125802	that he himself
125803	
125804	made to us:
125805	
125806	
125807	life.
125808	
125809	eternal
125810	
125811	These things I have written to you
125812	
125813	about
125814	
125815	those who are trying to deceive you.
125816	
125817	
125818	
125819	
125820	Now as for you, the anointing
125821	that
125822	you received
125823	from him
125824	
125825	resides
125826	in you,
125827	
125828	
125829	no
125830	need
125831	and you have
125832	for
125833	anyone
125834	to teach you.
125835	
125836	But
125837	as
125838	
125839	
125840	his anointing
125841	teaches you
125842	
125843	about
125844	all things,
125845	
125846	true
125847	it is
125848	
125849	not
125850	and is
125851	a lie.
125852	
125853	Just as
125854	it has taught you,
125855	
125856	you reside
125857	in him.
125858	
125859	
125860	And now,
125861	little children,
125862	remain
125863	in him,
125864	
125865	so that
125866	in shame when
125867	when he appears
125868	we may have
125869	confidence
125870	
125871	and not
125872	shrink away
125873	from him
125874	
125875	
125876	
125877	he comes back.
125878	
125879	If
125880	you know
125881	that
125882	righteous,
125883	he is
125884	know

125888	
125889	who practices

125904	God’s
125905	we should be called

125907	and indeed we are!
125908	For
125909	
125910	
125911	this reason the world
125912	does not
125913	know us:
125914	
125915	
125916	because it did not
125917	know him.

125936	
125937	because we will see him
125938	
125939	just as
125940	he is.
125941	
125942	And everyone
125943	
125944	who has
125945	
125946	this hope
125947	
125948	focused on him
125949	
125950	purifies
125951	himself,

126019	sin
126020	of

126022	the devil,
126023	is
126024	
126025	from
126026	the beginning.
126027	
126028	because the devil
126029	has been sinning
126030	For
126031	
126032	was revealed:
126033	
126034	this purpose the Son

126042	of the devil.
126043	Everyone
126044

126046	by
126047	
126048	God

126104	from
126105	the beginning:
126106	that we should
126107	love
126108	one another,
126109	not
126110	like
126111	Cain
126112	of

126114	the evil one
126115	who was

126117	and brutally murdered
126118	
126119	his brother.
126120	
126121	
126122

126124	did he murder him?
126125

126129	
126130	evil,
126131	were

126133	but
126134	
126135	his brother’s
126136	
126137	were righteous.
126138

126153	death
126154	to
126155	
126156	life
126157	
126158	because we love
126159	
126160	our fellow Christians.
126161	
126162	The one who does not
126163	love
126164	remains

126184	eternal
126185	in him.
126186	
126187	residing
126188	by this:
126189	
126190	We have come to know
126191	
126192	love
126193	
126194	that Jesus

126199	
126200	laid down
126201	
126202	
126203	thus we ought
126204	for

126206	our fellow Christians.
126207	
126208	our lives
126209	to lay down
126210	
126211	But
126212	whoever
126213	has
126214	
126215	possessions
126216	
126217	the world’s
126218	
126219	and sees
126220	
126221	his fellow Christian
126222	
126223	need
126224	in

126226	and shuts off
126227	
126228	his compassion
126229	
126230	against him,

126232	how
126233	
126234	can the love
126235	
126236	of God
126237	reside
126238	in such a person?
126239	
126240	Little children,
126241	let us not

126247	but
126248	in
126249	deed
126250	
126251	and truth.
126252	
126253	And by

126880	God
126881	conquers

126911	the Son
126912

126936	and the blood.
126937	
126938	
126939	And the Spirit

126941	
126942	the one who testifies,
126943	
126944	
126945	because the Spirit
126946	is

126976	the testimony
126977	
126978	of God
126979	greater,
126980	is

127068	I have written
127069	
127070	so that
127071	you may know
127072	
127073	life.
127074	that you have
127075	eternal
127076	
127077	these things to you who believe
127078	in
127079	
127080	the name
127081	
127082	of the Son
127083	
127084	of God
127085	
127086	
127087	And this is
127088	
127089	the confidence
127090	
127091	that we have
127092	before him:
127093	
127094	
127095	that whenever
127096	anything
127097	we ask
127098	according to
127099	
127100	his will,
127101	
127102	he hears us.
127103	
127104	
127105	And if
127106	we know
127107	
127108	he hears us
127109	
127110	that
127111	in regard to whatever
127112	we ask,
127113	then we know
127114	that
127115	we have
127116	
127117	the requests
127118	that
127119	we have asked
127120	from him.
127121	
127122	If
127123	anyone
127124	sees
127125	
127126	his fellow Christian
127127	
127128	committing
127129	a sin
127130	not
127131	resulting in
127132	death,
127133	he should ask,
127134	
127135	and God will grant
127136	
127137	life
127138	to the person who
127139	commits a sin
127140	not
127141	resulting in
127142	death.
127143	There is
127144	a sin
127145	resulting in
127146	death.
127147	I do not
127148	about
127149	that.
127150	say
127151	that
127152	he should ask
127153	All
127154	unrighteousness
127155	sin,
127156	is
127157	
127158	but there is
127159	sin
127160	not
127161	resulting in
127162	death.
127163	We know
127164	
127165	that everyone
127166	
127167	fathered
127168	by
127169	
127170	God
127171	does not
127172	sin,
127173	but
127174	
127175	has fathered,
127176	
127177	
127178	the one he
127179	God protects
127180	
127181	
127182	
127183	and the evil one
127184	cannot
127185	touch him.
127186	
127187	We know
127188	
127189	from
127190	
127191	God,
127192	that we are
127193	
127194	
127195	world
127196	and the whole
127197	in
127198	
127199	the power of the evil one.
127200	lies
127201	we know
127202	And
127203	
127204	
127205	that the Son
127206	
127207	of God
127208	has come
127209	
127210	and has given us
127211	
127212	insight
127213	to
127214	know
127215	
127216	him who is true,
127217	
127218	and we are
127219	in
127220	
127221	him who is true,
127222	in
127223	
127224	his Son
127225	
127226	Jesus
127227	Christ.
127228	
127229	This one is
127230	
127231	the true
127232	God
127233	
127234	life.
127235	and eternal
127236	Little children,
127237	guard
127238	yourselves
127239	from
127240	
127241	idols.
127242	
127243	From the elder,
127244	to an elect
127245	lady
127246	
127247	
127248	and her children,
127249	
127250	whom
127251	
127252	I love
127253	in
127254	truth
127255	
127256	(and not
127257	
127258	I alone,
127259	but
127260	
127261	also all
127262	
127263	those who know
127264	
127265	the truth),
127266	because of
127267	
127268	the truth
127269	
127270	that resides
127271	in us
127272	
127273	
127274	with us
127275	
127276	and will be
127277	
127278	
127279	forever.
127280	will be
127281	with us
127282	
127283	Grace,
127284	mercy,
127285	and peace
127286	from
127287	God
127288	the Father
127289	
127290	and from
127291	Jesus
127292	Christ
127293	
127294	the Son
127295	
127296	of the Father,
127297	in
127298	truth
127299	
127300	and love.
127301	I rejoiced
127302	greatly
127303	
127304	because I have found
127305	some
127306	
127307	of your children
127308	
127309	living
127310	according to
127311	the truth,
127312	just as
127313	commanded us.
127314	
127315	
127316	
127317	the Father
127318	
127319	But now
127320	I ask you,
127321	
127322	lady
127323	(not
127324	as
127325	commandment to you,
127326	if I were writing
127327	
127328	a new
127329	but
127330	the one
127331	we have had
127332	from
127333	the beginning),
127334	that
127335	we love
127336	one another.
127337	
127338	
127339	(Now this is
127340	
127341	love:
127342	that
127343	we walk
127344	according to
127345	
127346	his commandments.)
127347	
127348	
127349	
127350	the commandment,
127351	This is
127352	just as
127353	you have heard
127354	from
127355	the beginning;
127356	thus
127357	in it.
127358	
127359	you should walk
127360	
127361	For many
127362	deceivers
127363	have gone out
127364	into
127365	
127366	the world,
127367	
127368	people who do not
127369	confess
127370	Jesus
127371	as Christ
127372	coming
127373	in
127374	the flesh.
127375	
127376	This person is
127377	
127378	the deceiver
127379	
127380	
127381	and the antichrist!
127382	Watch out,
127383	
127384	so that
127385	you do not
127386	lose
127387	the things
127388	we have worked for,
127389	but
127390	reward.
127391	a full
127392	receive
127393	Everyone
127394	
127395	who goes on ahead
127396	
127397	and does not
127398	remain
127399	in
127400	
127401	the teaching
127402	
127403	of Christ
127404	God.
127405	does not
127406	have
127407	
127408	The one who remains
127409	in
127410	
127411	this teaching
127412	
127413	
127414	
127415	both the Father
127416	
127417	
127418	and the Son.
127419	has
127420	If
127421	anyone
127422	comes
127423	to you
127424	
127425	
127426	
127427	
127428	this teaching,
127429	and does not
127430	bring
127431	do not
127432	receive him
127433	
127434	into
127435	your house
127436	
127437	any greeting,
127438	
127439	and do not
127440	give him
127441	
127442	the person who gives him
127443	because
127444	
127445	a greeting
127446	shares
127447	
127448	deeds.
127449	
127450	
127451	in his evil
127452	many
127453	Though I have
127454	
127455	other things to write to you,
127456	I do not
127457	want
127458	
127459	to do so with paper
127460	
127461	and ink,
127462	but
127463	I hope
127464	to come
127465	to

127467	
127468	face
127469	
127470	face,
127471	visit you and speak
127472	so that
127473	
127474	our joy
127475	
127476	may be
127477	complete.
127478	greet you.
127479	
127480	
127481	The children
127482	
127483	sister
127484	
127485	
127486	of your elect
127487	
127488	From the elder,
127489	to Gaius
127490	
127491	my dear brother,
127492	whom
127493	
127494	I love
127495	in
127496	truth.
127497	Dear friend,
127498	that
127499	all
127500	I pray
127501	with you
127502	may go well
127503	and that
127504	you may be in good health,
127505	just as
127506	it is well
127507	
127508	
127509	with your soul.
127510	I rejoiced
127511	For
127512	greatly
127513	came
127514	when the brothers
127515	
127516	and testified
127517	
127518	
127519	your truth,
127520	just as
127521	
127522	to
127523	according to the truth.
127524	you are living
127525	greater
127526	
127527	no
127528	I have
127529	joy
127530	than this: to
127531	hear
127532	
127533	that my
127534	children
127535	according to
127536	the truth.
127537	are living
127538	Dear friend,
127539	faithfulness
127540	you do
127541	
127542	by whatever
127543	you demonstrate
127544	for
127545	
127546	the brothers
127547	
127548	
127549	(even though they are strangers).
127550	They
127551	have testified
127552	
127553	
127554	to your love
127555	before
127556	the church.
127557	
127558	well
127559	You will do
127560	to send them on their way
127561	in a manner worthy
127562	
127563	of God.
127564	on behalf of
127565	For
127566	
127567	“The Name,”
127568	they have gone forth
127569	nothing
127570	accepting
127571	from
127572	
127573	the pagans.
127574	
127575	Therefore
127576	we ought
127577	to support
127578	
127579	such people,
127580	so that
127581	coworkers
127582	we become
127583	
127584	in cooperation with the truth.
127585	I wrote
127586	something
127587	
127588	to the church,
127589	but
127590	
127591	who loves to be first among them,
127592	
127593	Diotrephes,
127594	does not
127595	acknowledge us.
127596	
127597	
127598	Therefore,
127599	if
127600	I come,
127601	I will call attention
127602	
127603	
127604	to the deeds
127605	
127606	he is doing –
127607	words!
127608	with evil
127609	the bringing of unjustified charges against us
127610	
127611	
127612	And not
127613	being content
127614	with
127615	
127616	that, he not
127617	
127618	only refuses to welcome
127619	
127620	the brothers himself,
127621	
127622	
127623	the people who want to do so
127624	but hinders
127625	
127626	them out of
127627	
127628	the church!
127629	and throws
127630	Dear friend,
127631	do not
127632	imitate
127633	
127634	what is bad
127635	but
127636	
127637	what is good.
127638	
127639	The one who does good
127640	of
127641	
127642	God;
127643	is
127644	
127645	the one who does what is bad
127646	has not
127647	seen
127648	
127649	God.
127650	Demetrius
127651	has been testified to
127652	by
127653	all,
127654	
127655	even by
127656	
127657	
127658	the truth
127659	
127660	
127661	
127662	itself. We also testify to him,
127663	
127664	and you know
127665

127670	is
127671	many things
127672	I have
127673	to write to you,
127674	
127675	but
127676	I do not
127677	wish
127678	with
127679	pen
127680	
127681	and ink.
127682

127685	But
127686	right away,
127687

127691	to

127734	
127735	about
127736	
127737	our common
127738	
127739	salvation,
127740	compelled
127741	I now feel
127742	instead to write
127743	
127744	to encourage
127745	you to contend earnestly
127746	
127747	that was once for all
127748	entrusted

127750	to the saints.
127751	for the faith

127754	certain
127755	men
127756	men who
127757	among you –
127758	long ago were marked out
127759	for
127760	
127761	the
127762	condemnation
127763	I am about to describe – ungodly men

127785	I desire

128161	eternity.
128162	Amen.
128163	The revelation
128164	of Jesus
128165	Christ,
128166	which
128167	gave him
128168	
128169	
128170	God
128171	to show
128172	
128173	his servants
128174	
128175	what
128176	must
128177	happen
128178	
128179	very soon.
128180	
128181	He made
128182	it clear by sending
128183	
128184	
128185	his angel
128186	
128187	
128188	to his servant
128189	
128190	John,
128191	who
128192	then testified
128193	
128194	concerning the word
128195	
128196	of God
128197	
128198	
128199	and the testimony

128211	the words
128212	
128213	of this prophecy aloud,

128215	and obey
128216	
128217	in it,
128218	
128219	the things written

128268	
128269	the ruler
128270	
128271	over the kings
128272	
128273	of the earth.
128274	
128275	To the one who loves us
128276	
128277	
128278	and has set us
128279	
128280	free from
128281	
128282	our sins
128283	
128284	at
128285	
128286	the cost of his own blood
128287	
128288	
128289	and has appointed us
128290	
128291	as a kingdom,
128292	as priests
128293	
128294	serving his God
128295	
128296	and Father – to him

128303	and the power
128304	for
128305	
128306	ever
128307	
128308	and ever!
128309	Amen.
128310	(Look!
128311	He is returning
128312	with
128313	
128314	the clouds,
128315	
128316	will see him,
128317	
128318	and every
128319	eye
128320	
128321	even those who
128322	
128323	pierced him,
128324	
128325	will mourn
128326	because of him.
128327	
128328	and all
128329	
128330	the tribes
128331	
128332	on the earth
128333	This will certainly come to pass!
128334	Amen.)

128336	“I am
128337	
128338	the Alpha
128339	
128340	
128341	and the Omega,”
128342	says
128343	the Lord
128344	
128345	God –
128346	
128347	the one who is,
128348	
128349	
128350	and who was,
128351	
128352	
128353	and who is still to come –
128354	
128355	the All-Powerful!
128356	
128357	I, John,
128358	
128359	your brother
128360	
128361	
128362	and the one who shares
128363	with you in
128364	
128365	the persecution,
128366	
128367	kingdom,
128368	
128369	and endurance
128370	that are in
128371	Jesus,
128372	was
128373	on
128374	
128375	the island
128376	
128377	called
128378	Patmos
128379	because of
128380	
128381	the word
128382	
128383	of God
128384	
128385	
128386	and the testimony
128387	about Jesus.
128388	I was
128389	in
128390	the Spirit
128391	on
128392	
128393	the Lord’s
128394	Day
128395	
128396	when I heard
128397	behind me
128398	
128399	voice
128400	a loud
128401	like
128402	a trumpet,
128403	saying:
128404	what
128405	you see
128406	“Write
128407	in
128408	a book
128409	
128410	and send
128411	
128412	it to the seven
128413	churches –
128414	to
128415	Ephesus,
128416	
128417	
128418	Smyrna,
128419	
128420	
128421	Pergamum,
128422	
128423	
128424	Thyatira,
128425	
128426	
128427	Sardis,
128428	
128429	
128430	Philadelphia,
128431	
128432	
128433	and Laodicea.”
128434	
128435	I turned
128436	to see
128437	
128438	whose voice
128439	was
128440	speaking
128441	to me,
128442	
128443	
128444	and when I did
128445	so, I saw
128446	seven
128447	lampstands,
128448	golden
128449	
128450	and in
128451	the midst
128452	
128453	of the lampstands
128454	was one like
128455	a son
128456	of man.
128457	He was dressed in a robe
128458	extending down to his feet
128459	
128460	and he wore a wide
128461	around
128462	
128463	his chest.
128464	belt
128465	golden
128466	
128467	
128468	His head
128469	
128470	
128471	
128472	and hair
128473	were as white
128474	as
128475	wool,
128476	white
128477	even as
128478	snow,
128479	
128480	
128481	and his eyes
128482	
128483	as
128484	flame.
128485	were like a fiery

128487	
128488	His feet
128489	
128490	
128491	polished bronze
128492	were like
128493	in
128494	a furnace,
128495	refined
128496	
128497	
128498	and his voice
128499	
128500	was like
128501	the roar
128502	waters.
128503	of many
128504	
128505	He held
128506	in
128507	
128508	his right
128509	hand,
128510	
128511	stars

128518	sword
128519	double-edged
128520	and a sharp

128529	shining
128530	at
128531	
128532	full strength.
128533	
128534	
128535	When
128536	I saw him
128537	
128538	I fell down
128539	at
128540	
128541	his feet
128542	
128543	as though
128544	I were dead,
128545	
128546	but he placed
128547	
128548	his right hand
128549	
128550	on me
128551	
128552	and said:

128588	what

128591	what

129199	
129200	I come.

129208	the end,
129209	
129210	in my deeds

129214	authority
129215	over
129216	
129217	the nations –

129234	
129235	my Father –

129793	And the first
129794	what
129795	I had heard
129796	like
129797	a trumpet
129798	speaking
129799	to me
129800	
129801	said:
129802	
129803	“Come up here
129804	
129805	so that I can show you

129834	jasper

129836	
129837	
129838	and a rainbow

129840	
129841	the throne.
129842	like
129843	looking
129844	it was made of emerald
129845	
129846	In a circle around
129847	
129848	the throne
129849	other thrones,

129862	clothing
129863	in white
129864	
129865	on
129866	
129867	their heads.
129868	
129869	crowns
129870	and had golden

129872	From
129873	
129874	the throne
129875	came out
129876	flashes of lightning
129877	
129878	and roaring
129879	
129880	and crashes of thunder.
129881	
129882	Seven
129883	torches,
129884	flaming
129885	were burning
129886	of
129887	
129888	in front of the throne
129889	which
129890	are
129891	
129892	the seven
129893	spirits
129894	
129895	God,
129896	
129897	and in front of
129898	
129899	the throne
129900	was something like
129901	a sea
129902	of glass,
129903	like
129904	crystal.
129905	
129906	In
129907	the middle
129908	
129909	of the throne
129910	
129911	and around
129912	
129913	the throne
129914	were four
129915	living creatures
129916	full
129917	of eyes
129918	in front
129919	
129920	and in back.
129921	
129922	
129923	living creature
129924	
129925	The first
129926	was like
129927	a lion,
129928	
129929	
129930	the second
129931	creature
129932	like
129933	an ox,
129934	
129935	
129936	the third
129937	creature
129938	had
129939	
129940	a face
129941	like
129942	a man’s,
129943	
129944	
129945	and the fourth
129946	creature
129947	looked like
129948	an eagle
129949	flying.
129950	
129951	
129952	of the four
129953	living creatures
129954	one
129955	
129956	
129957	
129958	had
129959	Each
129960	wings
129961	six
129962	all around
129963	
129964	and inside.
129965	and was full
129966	of eyes
129967	
129968	rest
129969	They never
129970	
129971	day
129972	
129973	or night,
129974	saying:
129975	“Holy
129976	Holy
129977	Holy
129978	is the Lord
129979	
129980	God,
129981	
129982	the All-Powerful,
129983	
129984	Who was
129985	
129986	
129987	and who is,
129988	
129989	and who is
129990	still to come!”
129991	
129992	And whenever
129993	give
129994	
129995	the living creatures
129996	glory,
129997	
129998	honor,
129999	
130000	and thanks
130001	
130002	to the one who sits
130003	on
130004	
130005	the throne,
130006	
130007	who lives
130008	
130009	
130010	forever
130011	
130012	and ever,
130013	throw
130014	
130015	the twenty-
130016	four
130017	elders
130018	themselves to the ground before
130019	
130020	the one who sits
130021	on
130022	
130023	the throne
130024	
130025	and worship
130026	
130027	the one who lives
130028	
130029	
130030	forever
130031	
130032	and ever,
130033	
130034	and they offer
130035	
130036	their crowns
130037	
130038	before
130039	
130040	his throne,
130041	saying:
130042	worthy,
130043	“You are
130044	
130045	our Lord
130046	
130047	
130048	and God,
130049	
130050	to receive
130051	
130052	glory
130053	
130054	
130055	and honor
130056	
130057	
130058	and power,
130059	
130060	
130061	since you created
130062	
130063	all things,
130064	
130065	and because of
130066	
130067	your will
130068	
130069	they existed
130070	
130071	and were created!”
130072	
130073	Then I saw
130074	in
130075	
130076	the right hand
130077	
130078	of the one who was seated
130079	on
130080	
130081	the throne
130082	a scroll
130083	written
130084	on the front
130085	
130086	and back
130087	and sealed
130088	seals.
130089	with seven
130090	
130091	And I saw
130092	angel
130093	a powerful
130094	proclaiming
130095	in
130096	voice:
130097	a loud
130098	“Who
130099	is worthy
130100	to open
130101	
130102	the scroll
130103	
130104	and to break
130105	
130106	its seals?”
130107	
130108	
130109	But no one
130110	was able
130111	in
130112	
130113	heaven
130114	or
130115	on
130116	
130117	earth
130118	or
130119	under
130120	
130121	the earth
130122	to open
130123	
130124	the scroll
130125	or
130126	look into it.
130127	
130128	
130129	So I began weeping
130130	bitterly
130131	
130132	because no one
130133	who was worthy
130134	was found
130135	to open
130136	
130137	the scroll
130138	or
130139	to look into it.
130140	
130141	
130142	Then one
130143	of
130144	
130145	the elders
130146	said to me,
130147	
130148	“Stop
130149	weeping!
130150	Look,
130151	has conquered;
130152	
130153	the Lion
130154	
130155	of
130156	
130157	the tribe
130158	of Judah,
130159	
130160	the root
130161	of David,
130162	thus he can open
130163	
130164	the scroll
130165	
130166	
130167	and its seven
130168	seals.”
130169	
130170	
130171	Then I saw
130172	in
130173	the middle
130174	
130175	of the throne
130176	
130177	
130178	and of the four
130179	living creatures,
130180	
130181	and in
130182	the middle
130183	
130184	of the elders,
130185	a Lamb
130186	standing
130187	that appeared
130188	to have been killed.
130189	He had
130190	horns
130191	seven
130192	
130193	eyes,
130194	and seven
130195	which
130196	are
130197	
130198	the seven
130199	spirits
130200	
130201	of God
130202	sent out
130203	into
130204	all
130205	
130206	the earth.
130207	
130208	Then he came
130209	
130210	and took
130211	the scroll from
130212	
130213	the right hand
130214	
130215	of the one who was seated
130216	on
130217	
130218	the throne,
130219	
130220	and when
130221	he had taken
130222	
130223	the scroll,
130224	
130225	the four
130226	living creatures
130227	
130228	
130229	and the twenty-
130230	four
130231	elders
130232	threw
130233	themselves to the ground before
130234	
130235	the Lamb.
130236	of them had
130237	Each
130238	a harp
130239	
130240	bowls
130241	and golden
130242	full
130243	of incense
130244	(which
130245	are
130246	
130247	the prayers
130248	
130249	of the saints).
130250	
130251	They were singing
130252	song:
130253	a new
130254	
130255	worthy
130256	“You are
130257	to take
130258	
130259	the scroll
130260	
130261	and to open
130262	
130263	its seals
130264	
130265	
130266	because you were killed,
130267	
130268	you have purchased
130269	
130270	for God
130271	and at
130272	
130273	the cost of your own blood
130274	
130275	persons from
130276	every
130277	tribe,
130278	
130279	language,
130280	
130281	people,
130282	
130283	and nation.
130284	
130285	You have appointed them
130286	
130287	
130288	to serve our God,
130289	
130290	as a kingdom
130291	
130292	and priests
130293	
130294	and they will reign
130295	on
130296	
130297	the earth.”
130298	
130299	Then I looked
130300	
130301	and heard
130302	the voice
130303	angels
130304	of many
130305	in a circle
130306	
130307	around the throne,
130308	
130309	
130310	as well as the living creatures
130311	
130312	
130313	and the elders.
130314	
130315	was
130316	
130317	Their number
130318	
130319	ten thousand
130320	times ten thousand –
130321	
130322	thousands
130323	times thousands –
130324	all of whom were singing
130325	voice:
130326	in a loud
130327	“Worthy
130328	is
130329	
130330	the lamb
130331	
130332	who was killed
130333	to receive
130334	
130335	power
130336	
130337	and wealth
130338	
130339	and wisdom
130340	
130341	and might
130342	
130343	and honor
130344	
130345	and glory
130346	
130347	and praise!”
130348	
130349	every
130350	creature –
130351	
130352	in
130353	
130354	heaven,
130355	
130356	on
130357	
130358	earth,
130359	
130360	under
130361	
130362	the earth,
130363	
130364	in
130365	
130366	the sea,
130367	
130368	
130369	that is in them –
130370	
130371	and all
130372	Then I heard
130373	singing:
130374	
130375	“To the one seated
130376	on
130377	
130378	the throne
130379	
130380	
130381	and to the Lamb
130382	
130383	be praise,
130384	
130385	
130386	honor,
130387	
130388	
130389	glory,
130390	
130391	
130392	and ruling power
130393	
130394	
130395	forever
130396	
130397	and ever!”
130398	
130399	
130400	And the four
130401	living creatures
130402	were saying
130403	“Amen,”
130404	
130405	
130406	and the elders
130407	threw
130408	
130409	themselves to the ground and worshiped.
130410	
130411	I looked on
130412	when
130413	opened
130414	
130415	the Lamb
130416	one
130417	of
130418	
130419	the seven
130420	seals,
130421	
130422	and I heard
130423	one
130424	of
130425	
130426	the four
130427	living creatures
130428	saying
130429	with
130430	voice,
130431	a thunderous
130432	“Come!”
130433	
130434	So I looked,
130435	
130436	and here came
130437	horse!
130438	a white
130439	
130440	
130441	The one who rode
130442	
130443	
130444	it had
130445	a bow,
130446	
130447	and he was given
130448	
130449	a crown,
130450	
130451	he rode out
130452	and as a conqueror
130453	
130454	to
130455	conquer.
130456	
130457	Then when
130458	the Lamb opened
130459	
130460	seal,
130461	
130462	the second
130463	I heard
130464	
130465	the second
130466	living creature
130467	saying,
130468	“Come!”
130469	
130470	came out,
130471	And another
130472	horse,
130473	fiery red,
130474	
130475	
130476	and the one who rode
130477	
130478	
130479	it was granted permission
130480	
130481	to take
130482	
130483	peace
130484	from
130485	
130486	the earth,
130487	
130488	so that
130489	one another,
130490	people would butcher
130491	
130492	and he was given
130493	
130494	sword.
130495	a huge
130496	
130497	Then when
130498	the Lamb opened
130499	
130500	seal
130501	
130502	the third
130503	I heard
130504	
130505	the third
130506	living creature
130507	saying,
130508	“Come!”
130509	
130510	So I looked,
130511	
130512	and here came
130513	horse!
130514	a black
130515	
130516	
130517	The one who rode
130518	
130519	
130520	it had
130521	a balance scale
130522	in
130523	
130524	his hand.
130525	
130526	
130527	Then I heard
130528	something like
130529	a voice
130530	from
130531	among
130532	
130533	the four
130534	living creatures
130535	saying,
130536	“A quart
130537	of wheat
130538	will cost a day’s pay
130539	
130540	and three
130541	quarts
130542	of barley
130543	will cost a day’s pay.
130544	
130545	
130546	the olive oil
130547	
130548	
130549	and the wine!”
130550	But do not
130551	damage
130552	
130553	Then when
130554	the Lamb opened
130555	
130556	seal
130557	
130558	the fourth
130559	I heard
130560	the voice
130561	
130562	of the fourth
130563	living creature
130564	saying,
130565	“Come!”
130566	
130567	So I looked
130568	
130569	and here came
130570	horse!
130571	a pale green
130572	
130573	
130574	of the one who rode it
130575	
130576	right behind.
130577	The name
130578	
130579	
130580	was Death,
130581	
130582	
130583	and Hades
130584	followed
130585	
130586	
130587	
130588	They were given
130589	
130590	authority
130591	over
130592	
130593	a fourth
130594	
130595	of the earth,
130596	to kill
130597	its population with
130598	the sword,
130599	
130600	
130601	famine,
130602	
130603	
130604	and disease,
130605	
130606	and by
130607	
130608	the wild animals
130609	
130610	of the earth.
130611	
130612	Now when
130613	the Lamb opened
130614	
130615	the fifth
130616	seal,
130617	I saw
130618	under
130619	
130620	the altar
130621	
130622	the souls
130623	
130624	of those who had been violently killed
130625	because of
130626	
130627	the word
130628	
130629	of God
130630	
130631	and because of
130632	
130633	the testimony
130634	
130635	they had given.
130636	
130637	They cried out
130638	voice,
130639	with a loud
130640	
130641	“How
130642	long,
130643	
130644	Sovereign Master,
130645	
130646	holy
130647	
130648	and true,
130649	
130650	before you judge
130651	
130652	and avenge
130653	
130654	our blood?”
130655	
130656	
130657	
130658	those who live
130659	on
130660	
130661	the earth
130662	
130663	was given
130664	
130665	Each of them
130666	a long
130667	white robe
130668	
130669	and they were told
130670	
130671	rest
130672	to
130673	for
130674	longer,
130675	a little
130676	until
130677	the full number was reached
130678	
130679	
130680	of both their fellow servants
130681	
130682	
130683	
130684	and their brothers
130685	
130686	
130687	who were going
130688	to be killed
130689	just as they had been.
130690	
130691	
130692	
130693	Then I looked
130694	when
130695	the Lamb opened
130696	
130697	seal,
130698	
130699	the sixth
130700	
130701	earthquake
130702	and a huge
130703	took place;
130704	
130705	
130706	the sun
130707	became
130708	as black
130709	as
130710	sackcloth
130711	made of hair,
130712	
130713	
130714	moon
130715	and the full
130716	became
130717	
130718	blood red;
130719	
130720	
130721	and the stars
130722	
130723	in the sky
130724	fell
130725	to
130726	
130727	the earth
130728	like
130729	a fig tree
130730	dropping
130731	
130732	its unripe figs
130733	
130734	by
130735	wind.
130736	a fierce
130737	when shaken
130738	
130739	
130740	The sky
130741	was split apart
130742	like
130743	a scroll
130744	being rolled up,
130745	
130746	and every
130747	mountain
130748	
130749	and island
130750	from
130751	
130752	its place.
130753	
130754	was moved
130755	
130756	
130757	Then the kings
130758	
130759	of the earth,
130760	
130761	
130762	the very important people,
130763	
130764	
130765	the generals,
130766	
130767	
130768	the rich,
130769	
130770	
130771	the powerful,
130772	
130773	and everyone,
130774	slave
130775	
130776	and free,
130777	hid
130778	themselves
130779	in
130780	
130781	the caves
130782	
130783	and among
130784	
130785	the rocks
130786	
130787	of the mountains.
130788	
130789	They said
130790	
130791	to the mountains
130792	
130793	
130794	and to the rocks,
130795	“Fall
130796	on us
130797	
130798	
130799	and hide us
130800	
130801	from
130802	the face
130803	
130804	of the one who is seated
130805	on
130806	
130807	the throne
130808	
130809	and from
130810	
130811	the wrath
130812	
130813	of the Lamb,
130814	
130815	has come,
130816	
130817	day
130818	
130819	because the great
130820	
130821	of their wrath
130822	
130823	
130824	and who
130825	is able
130826	to withstand it?”
130827	After
130828	
130829	this I saw
130830	four
130831	angels
130832	standing
130833	at
130834	
130835	the four
130836	corners
130837	
130838	of the earth,
130839	holding back
130840	
130841	the four
130842	winds
130843	
130844	of the earth
130845	so
130846	no
130847	could blow
130848	wind
130849	on
130850	
130851	the earth,
130852	
130853	on
130854	
130855	the sea,
130856	or
130857	on
130858	any
130859	tree.
130860	
130861	Then I saw
130862	another
130863	angel
130864	ascending
130865	from
130866	
130867	the east,
130868	who had
130869	the seal
130870	God.
130871	of the living
130872	
130873	He shouted out
130874	voice
130875	with a loud
130876	
130877	to the four
130878	angels
130879	who
130880	had been given
130881	
130882	permission to damage
130883	
130884	the earth
130885	
130886	
130887	and the sea:
130888	
130889	“Do not
130890	damage
130891	
130892	the earth
130893	or
130894	
130895	the sea
130896	or
130897	
130898	the trees
130899	until
130900	we have put a seal
130901	
130902	of the servants
130903	
130904	of our God.”
130905	
130906	on
130907	
130908	the foreheads
130909	
130910	
130911	Now I heard
130912	
130913	the number
130914	of those
130915	who were marked with the seal,
130916	one hundred
130917	and forty-
130918	four
130919	thousand,
130920	sealed
130921	from
130922	all
130923	the tribes
130924	of the people
130925	of Israel:
130926	From
130927	the tribe
130928	of Judah,
130929	twelve
130930	thousand
130931	were sealed,
130932	from
130933	the tribe
130934	of Reuben,
130935	twelve
130936	thousand,
130937	from
130938	the tribe
130939	of Gad,
130940	twelve
130941	thousand,
130942	from
130943	the tribe
130944	of Asher,
130945	twelve
130946	thousand,
130947	from
130948	the tribe
130949	of Naphtali,
130950	twelve
130951	thousand,
130952	from
130953	the tribe
130954	of Manasseh,
130955	twelve
130956	thousand,
130957	from
130958	the tribe
130959	of Simeon,
130960	twelve
130961	thousand,
130962	from
130963	the tribe
130964	of Levi,
130965	twelve
130966	thousand,
130967	from
130968	the tribe
130969	of Issachar,
130970	twelve
130971	thousand,
130972	from
130973	the tribe
130974	of Zebulun,
130975	twelve
130976	thousand,
130977	from
130978	the tribe
130979	of Joseph,
130980	twelve
130981	thousand,
130982	from
130983	the tribe
130984	of Benjamin,
130985	twelve
130986	thousand
130987	were sealed.
130988	After
130989	
130990	these things I looked,
130991	
130992	and here
130993	crowd
130994	was an enormous
130995	that
130996	count,
130997	
130998	no one
130999	could
131000	made up of persons from
131001	every
131002	nation,
131003	
131004	tribe,
131005	
131006	people,
131007	
131008	and language,
131009	standing
131010	before
131011	
131012	the throne
131013	
131014	and before
131015	
131016	the Lamb
131017	dressed
131018	in long
131019	white
131020	
131021	robes, and with palm branches
131022	in
131023	
131024	their hands.
131025	
131026	
131027	They were shouting out
131028	voice,
131029	in a loud
131030	
131031	
131032	“Salvation
131033	
131034	belongs to our God,
131035	
131036	
131037	who is seated
131038	on
131039	
131040	the throne,
131041	
131042	
131043	and to the Lamb!”
131044	
131045	And all
131046	
131047	the angels
131048	stood
131049	there in a circle
131050	
131051	around the throne
131052	
131053	
131054	and around the elders
131055	
131056	
131057	and the four
131058	living creatures,
131059	
131060	and they threw
131061	to the ground before
131062	
131063	the throne
131064	themselves down with
131065	
131066	their faces
131067	
131068	
131069	and worshiped
131070	
131071	God,
131072	saying,
131073	“Amen!
131074	
131075	Praise
131076	
131077	
131078	and glory,
131079	
131080	
131081	and wisdom
131082	
131083	
131084	and thanksgiving,
131085	
131086	
131087	and honor
131088	
131089	
131090	and power
131091	
131092	
131093	and strength
131094	
131095	be to our God
131096	
131097	for
131098	
131099	ever
131100	
131101	and ever.
131102	Amen!”
131103	
131104	
131105	Then one
131106	
131107	
131108	of the elders
131109	asked me,
131110	
131111	
131112	
131113	“These dressed in
131114	
131115	long
131116	
131117	white robes –
131118	who
131119	are
131120	
131121	they and where
131122	have they come from?”
131123	
131124	So I said to him,
131125	
131126	“My lord,
131127	
131128	
131129	you know the answer.”
131130	
131131	Then he said to me,
131132	
131133	
131134	“These are
131135	
131136	the ones who have come
131137	out of
131138	
131139	tribulation.
131140	
131141	the great
131142	
131143	They have washed
131144	
131145	their robes
131146	
131147	
131148	and made them
131149	
131150	white in
131151	
131152	the blood
131153	
131154	of the Lamb!
131155	For
131156	
131157	this reason they are
131158	before
131159	
131160	the throne
131161	
131162	of God,
131163	
131164	and they serve him
131165	
131166	day
131167	
131168	and night
131169	in
131170	
131171	his temple,
131172	
131173	
131174	
131175	and the one seated
131176	on
131177	
131178	the throne
131179	will shelter them.
131180	
131181	
131182	They will
131183	go hungry
131184	never
131185	or
131186	be thirsty
131187	again,
131188	
131189	will not
131190	beat down
131191	on them,
131192	
131193	
131194	and the sun
131195	nor
131196	any
131197	burning heat,
131198	
131199	
131200	because the Lamb
131201	
131202	
131203	in the middle
131204	
131205	of the throne
131206	will shepherd them
131207	
131208	
131209	and lead them
131210	
131211	of
131212	living
131213	to springs
131214	water,
131215	
131216	will wipe away
131217	
131218	and God
131219	every
131220	tear
131221	from
131222	
131223	their eyes.”
131224	
131225	
131226	Now when
131227	the Lamb opened
131228	
131229	seal
131230	
131231	the seventh
131232	there was
131233	silence
131234	in
131235	
131236	heaven
131237	for about
131238	half an hour.
131239	
131240	Then I saw
131241	
131242	the seven
131243	angels
131244	who
131245	before
131246	
131247	God,
131248	stand
131249	
131250	were given to them.
131251	
131252	and seven
131253	trumpets
131254	
131255	Another
131256	angel
131257	came
131258	
131259	and was stationed
131260	at
131261	
131262	the altar.
131263	holding
131264	censer
131265	a golden
131266	
131267	was given to him
131268	
131269	of incense
131270	A large amount
131271	to
131272	offer up,
131273	
131274	with the prayers
131275	
131276	the saints,
131277	of all
131278	on
131279	
131280	altar
131281	
131282	the golden
131283	
131284	that is before
131285	
131286	the throne.
131287	
131288	ascended
131289	
131290	The smoke
131291	
131292	coming from the incense,
131293	
131294	along with the prayers
131295	
131296	of the saints,
131297	from
131298	hand.
131299	
131300	the angel’s
131301	before
131302	
131303	God
131304	
131305	took
131306	
131307	Then the angel
131308	
131309	the censer,
131310	
131311	filled it
131312	
131313	with
131314	
131315	fire
131316	
131317	from the altar,
131318	
131319	and threw
131320	it on
131321	
131322	the earth,
131323	
131324	and there were
131325	crashes of thunder,
131326	
131327	roaring,
131328	
131329	flashes of lightning,
131330	
131331	and an earthquake.
131332	
131333	
131334	Now the seven
131335	angels
131336	
131337	holding
131338	
131339	the seven
131340	trumpets
131341	prepared
131342	
131343	to
131344	blow them.
131345	
131346	
131347	The first
131348	angel blew his trumpet,
131349	
131350	and there was
131351	hail
131352	
131353	and fire
131354	mixed
131355	with
131356	blood,
131357	
131358	and it was thrown
131359	at
131360	
131361	the earth
131362	
131363	
131364	so that a third
131365	
131366	of the earth
131367	was burned up,
131368	
131369	
131370	a third
131371	
131372	of the trees
131373	were burned up,
131374	
131375	and all
131376	grass
131377	the green
131378	was burned up.
131379	
131380	
131381	Then the second
131382	angel
131383	blew
131384	
131385	his trumpet, and something like
131386	mountain
131387	a great
131388	fire
131389	of burning
131390	was thrown
131391	into
131392	
131393	the sea.
131394	
131395	became
131396	
131397	A third
131398	
131399	of the sea
131400	blood,
131401	
131402	died,
131403	
131404	and a third
131405	
131406	of the creatures
131407	
131408	in
131409	
131410	the sea
131411	
131412	
131413	living
131414	
131415	
131416	and a third
131417	
131418	of the ships
131419	were completely destroyed.
131420	
131421	
131422	Then the third
131423	angel
131424	blew
131425	
131426	fell
131427	from
131428	
131429	the sky;
131430	star
131431	his trumpet, and a huge
131432	burning
131433	like
131434	a torch
131435	
131436	it landed
131437	on
131438	
131439	a third
131440	
131441	of the rivers
131442	
131443	and on
131444	
131445	the springs
131446	
131447	of water.
131448	
131449	
131450	(Now the name
131451	
131452	of the star
131453	is
131454	
131455	Wormwood.)
131456	
131457	became
131458	
131459	So a third
131460	
131461	of the waters
131462	
131463	wormwood,
131464	
131465	and many
131466	
131467	people
131468	died
131469	from
131470	
131471	these waters
131472	
131473	because they were poisoned.
131474	
131475	
131476	Then the fourth
131477	angel
131478	blew
131479	
131480	was struck,
131481	
131482	his trumpet, and a third
131483	
131484	of the sun
131485	
131486	
131487	and a third
131488	
131489	of the moon,
131490	
131491	
131492	and a third
131493	
131494	of the stars,
131495	so that
131496	were darkened.
131497	
131498	a third of them
131499	
131500	
131501	
131502	of the day
131503	And there was no
131504	light
131505	
131506	for a third
131507	
131508	
131509	
131510	and for a third of the night
131511	likewise.
131512	
131513	Then I looked,
131514	
131515	and I heard
131516	an
131517	eagle
131518	flying
131519	
131520	directly overhead,
131521	proclaiming
131522	voice,
131523	with a loud
131524	“Woe!
131525	Woe!
131526	Woe
131527	
131528	to those who live
131529	on
131530	
131531	the earth
131532	because of
131533	
131534	the remaining
131535	sounds
131536	
131537	of the trumpets
131538	
131539	of the three
131540	angels
131541	
131542	who are about
131543	to blow them!”
131544	
131545	
131546	Then the fifth
131547	angel
131548	blew
131549	
131550	his trumpet, and I saw
131551	a star
131552	from
131553	
131554	the sky
131555	that had fallen
131556	to
131557	
131558	the earth,
131559	
131560	and he was given
131561	
131562	
131563	the key
131564	
131565	to the shaft
131566	
131567	of the abyss.
131568	
131569	He opened
131570	
131571	the shaft
131572	
131573	of the abyss
131574	
131575	rose out
131576	and smoke
131577	of
131578	
131579	it
131580	like
131581	smoke
131582	furnace.
131583	from a giant
131584	
131585	were darkened
131586	
131587	The sun
131588	
131589	
131590	and the air
131591	with
131592	
131593	smoke
131594	
131595	from the shaft.
131596	
131597	Then out of
131598	
131599	the smoke
131600	came
131601	locusts
131602	onto
131603	
131604	the earth,
131605	
131606	and they were given
131607	
131608	power
131609	like
131610	
131611	
131612	
131613	that of the scorpions
131614	
131615	of the earth.
131616	
131617	They were told
131618	
131619	
131620	not
131621	to damage
131622	
131623	the grass
131624	
131625	of the earth,
131626	or
131627	any
131628	green plant
131629	or
131630	
131631	tree,
131632	
131633	but only
131634	
131635	those people
131636	who
131637	did not
131638	have
131639	
131640	the seal
131641	
131642	of God
131643	on
131644	
131645	their forehead.
131646	
131647	The locusts were
131648	
131649	given permission to
131650	not
131651	kill them,
131652	
131653	but
131654	only to
131655	torture them
131656	months,
131657	for five
131658	
131659	
131660	and their torture
131661	
131662	was like
131663	that
131664	of a scorpion
131665	when
131666	it stings
131667	a person.
131668	
131669	In
131670	
131671	days
131672	those
131673	will seek
131674	
131675	people
131676	
131677	death,
131678	
131679	
131680	but will not
131681	be able to find
131682	
131683	
131684	it; they will long
131685	to die,
131686	
131687	will flee
131688	
131689	but death
131690	from them.
131691	
131692	
131693	
131694	looked like
131695	
131696	Now the locusts
131697	similar
131698	horses
131699	equipped
131700	for
131701	battle.
131702	
131703	On
131704	
131705	their heads
131706	
131707	were something like
131708	crowns
131709	
131710	to gold,
131711	
131712	
131713	and their faces
131714	
131715	looked like
131716	faces.
131717	men’s
131718	
131719	They had
131720	hair
131721	like
131722	hair,
131723	women’s
131724	
131725	
131726	and their teeth
131727	
131728	like
131729	lions’ teeth.
131730	were
131731	
131732	They had
131733	breastplates
131734	like
131735	breastplates,
131736	iron
131737	
131738	
131739	and the sound
131740	
131741	of their wings
131742	
131743	was like
131744	the noise
131745	chariots
131746	horse-drawn
131747	of many
131748	charging
131749	into
131750	battle.
131751	
131752	They have
131753	tails
131754	like
131755	scorpions,
131756	
131757	and stingers
131758	
131759	is in
131760	
131761	their tails.
131762	
131763	
131764	and their ability
131765	
131766	to injure
131767	
131768	people
131769	months
131770	for five
131771	They have
131772	over them
131773	
131774	as king
131775	
131776	the angel
131777	
131778	of the abyss,
131779	whose name
131780	
131781	in Hebrew
131782	Abaddon,
131783	
131784	and in
131785	
131786	Greek,
131787	
131788	is
131789	Apollyon.
131790	
131791	woe
131792	
131793	The first
131794	has passed,
131795	but
131796	coming
131797	are still
131798	two
131799	woes
131800	after these things!
131801	
131802	
131803	
131804	Then the sixth
131805	angel
131806	blew
131807	
131808	his trumpet, and I heard
131809	voice
131810	a single
131811	coming from
131812	
131813	
131814	the horns
131815	
131816	altar
131817	
131818	on the golden
131819	
131820	that is before
131821	
131822	God,
131823	saying
131824	
131825	to the sixth
131826	angel,
131827	
131828	the one holding
131829	
131830	the trumpet,
131831	“Set free
131832	
131833	the four
131834	angels
131835	
131836	who are bound
131837	at
131838	
131839	river
131840	
131841	the great
131842	Euphrates!”
131843	
131844	were set free
131845	
131846	Then the four
131847	angels
131848	
131849	who had been prepared
131850	for
131851	
131852	this hour,
131853	
131854	day,
131855	
131856	month,
131857	
131858	and year
131859	to
131860	kill
131861	
131862	a third
131863	
131864	of humanity.
131865	
131866	
131867	The number
131868	
131869	of soldiers
131870	
131871	on horseback
131872	
131873	was two hundred million;
131874	I heard
131875	
131876	their number.
131877	
131878	
131879	Now this is what
131880	looked
131881	
131882	the horses
131883	like in
131884	
131885	my vision:
131886	
131887	
131888	and their riders
131889	
131890	
131891	The riders had
131892	breastplates
131893	that were fiery red,
131894	
131895	dark blue,
131896	
131897	and sulfurous yellow
131898	
131899	
131900	in color. The heads
131901	
131902	of the horses
131903	looked like
131904	heads,
131905	lions’
131906	
131907	of
131908	
131909	their mouths.
131910	
131911	came out
131912	and fire,
131913	
131914	smoke,
131915	
131916	and sulfur
131917	by
131918	
131919	these three
131920	plagues,
131921	
131922	was killed
131923	
131924	A third
131925	
131926	of humanity
131927	that is, by
131928	
131929	the fire,
131930	
131931	
131932	the smoke,
131933	
131934	
131935	and the sulfur
131936	
131937	that came out
131938	of
131939	
131940	their mouths.
131941	
131942	
131943	For
131944	the power
131945	
131946	of the horses
131947	in
131948	
131949	their mouths
131950	
131951	resides
131952	
131953	and in
131954	
131955	their tails,
131956	
131957	
131958	because
131959	their tails
131960	
131961	are like
131962	snakes,
131963	having
131964	heads
131965	
131966	
131967	
131968	that inflict injuries.
131969	
131970	
131971	The rest
131972	
131973	of humanity,
131974	idols
131975	who had not
131976	been killed
131977	by
131978	
131979	these plagues,
131980	
131981	did not
131982	repent
131983	of
131984	
131985	the works
131986	
131987	of their hands,
131988	
131989	so that
131990	they did not stop
131991	worshiping
131992	
131993	demons
131994	
131995	
131996	and idols
131997	
131998	made of gold,
131999	
132000	
132001	silver,
132002	
132003	
132004	bronze,
132005	
132006	
132007	stone,
132008	
132009	
132010	and wood –
132011	
132012	
132013	see
132014	that cannot
132015	or
132016	hear
132017	or
132018	walk about.
132019	
132020	Furthermore, they did not
132021	repent
132022	of
132023	
132024	their murders,
132025	
132026	
132027	of
132028	
132029	their magic spells,
132030	
132031	
132032	of
132033	
132034	their sexual immorality,
132035	
132036	or
132037	of
132038	
132039	their stealing.
132040	
132041	
132042	Then I saw
132043	another
132044	angel
132045	powerful
132046	descending
132047	from
132048	
132049	heaven,
132050	wrapped
132051	in a cloud,
132052	
132053	
132054	with a rainbow
132055	above
132056	
132057	his head;
132058	
132059	
132060	
132061	his face
132062	
132063	was like
132064	
132065	the sun
132066	
132067	
132068	and his legs
132069	
132070	were like
132071	pillars
132072	of fire.
132073	
132074	He held
132075	in
132076	
132077	his hand
132078	
132079	a little scroll
132080	that was open,
132081	
132082	and he put
132083	
132084	foot
132085	
132086	
132087	his right
132088	on
132089	
132090	the sea
132091	
132092	and
132093	his left
132094	on
132095	
132096	the land.
132097	
132098	Then he shouted
132099	voice
132100	in a loud
132101	like
132102	a lion
132103	roaring,
132104	
132105	and when
132106	he shouted,
132107	sounded
132108	
132109	the seven
132110	thunders
132111	
132112	their
132113	voices.
132114	
132115	When
132116	spoke,
132117	
132118	the seven
132119	thunders
132120	I was preparing
132121	to write,
132122	
132123	but just then I heard
132124	a voice
132125	from
132126	
132127	heaven
132128	say,
132129	“Seal up
132130	what
132131	spoke
132132	
132133	the seven
132134	thunders
132135	
132136	and do not
132137	
132138	write it down.”
132139	
132140	
132141	Then the angel
132142	
132143	I saw
132144	standing
132145	on
132146	
132147	the sea
132148	
132149	and on
132150	
132151	the land
132152	raised
132153	
132154	hand
132155	
132156	
132157	his right
132158	to
132159	
132160	heaven
132161	
132162	and swore
132163	by
132164	
132165	the one who lives
132166	
132167	
132168	forever
132169	
132170	and ever,
132171	who
132172	created
132173	
132174	heaven
132175	
132176	
132177	and what is in it,
132178	
132179	
132180	
132181	and the earth
132182	
132183	
132184	and what is in it,
132185	
132186	
132187	
132188	and the sea
132189	
132190	
132191	and what is in
132192	
132193	
132194	delay!
132195	no more
132196	it, “There will be
132197	But
132198	in
132199	
132200	the days
132201	
132202	
132203	
132204	the seventh
132205	angel
132206	when
132207	is about
132208	to blow
132209	
132210	is completed,
132211	
132212	his trumpet, the mystery
132213	
132214	of God
132215	just as
132216	he has proclaimed
132217	
132218	to his
132219	servants
132220	
132221	the prophets.”
132222	
132223	
132224	Then the voice
132225	
132226	I had heard
132227	from
132228	
132229	heaven
132230	again,
132231	began to speak
132232	to me
132233	
132234	
132235	
132236	“Go
132237	and take
132238	
132239	scroll
132240	
132241	the open
132242	in
132243	
132244	the hand
132245	
132246	of the angel
132247	
132248	who is standing
132249	on
132250	
132251	the sea
132252	
132253	and on
132254	
132255	the land.”
132256	
132257	So I went
132258	to
132259	
132260	the angel
132261	and asked him
132262	
132263	to give me
132264	
132265	
132266	the little scroll.
132267	
132268	He said to me,
132269	
132270	“Take
132271	
132272	the scroll and eat
132273	it.
132274	
132275	bitter,
132276	It will make your
132277	
132278	stomach
132279	but
132280	in
132281	
132282	your mouth.”
132283	
132284	it will be
132285	as sweet
132286	as
132287	honey
132288	
132289	So I took
132290	
132291	the little scroll
132292	from
132293	
132294	hand
132295	
132296	the angel’s
132297	
132298	and ate it,
132299	
132300	
132301	
132302	in
132303	
132304	my mouth,
132305	
132306	and it did taste as
132307	as honey
132308	sweet
132309	
132310	but when
132311	I had eaten it,
132312	
132313	became bitter.
132314	
132315	my stomach
132316	
132317	
132318	Then they told me:
132319	
132320	“You must
132321	
132322	again
132323	prophesy
132324	about
132325	peoples,
132326	
132327	nations,
132328	
132329	languages,
132330	
132331	and kings.”
132332	many
132333	
132334	was given to me,
132335	
132336	Then a measuring rod
132337	like
132338	a staff
132339	and I was told,
132340	“Get up
132341	
132342	and measure
132343	
132344	the temple
132345	
132346	of God,
132347	
132348	
132349	and the altar,
132350	
132351	
132352	and the ones who worship
132353	
132354	there.
132355	
132356	
132357	courtyard
132358	
132359	the outer
132360	
132361	of the temple;
132362	leave it
132363	out,
132364	
132365	But do not
132366	
132367	measure
132368	
132369	because it has been given
132370	
132371	to the Gentiles,
132372	
132373	
132374	city
132375	
132376	on the holy
132377	and they will trample
132378	months.
132379	for forty-
132380	
132381	two
132382	
132383	And I will grant
132384	
132385	my two
132386	witnesses
132387	
132388	
132389	authority to prophesy
132390	days,
132391	
132392	
132393	for 1,260
132394	dressed
132395	in sackcloth.”
132396	
132397	(These are
132398	
132399	the two
132400	olive trees
132401	
132402	
132403	and the two
132404	lampstands
132405	
132406	before
132407	
132408	the Lord
132409	
132410	of the earth.)
132411	that stand
132412	
132413	If
132414	anyone
132415	
132416	wants
132417	to harm them,
132418	fire
132419	comes out
132420	of
132421	
132422	their mouths
132423	
132424	
132425	and completely consumes
132426	
132427	their enemies.
132428	
132429	
132430	If
132431	anyone
132432	wants
132433	
132434	to harm them,
132435	this way.
132436	they must
132437	
132438	be killed
132439	
132440	These two have
132441	
132442	the power
132443	to close up
132444	
132445	the sky
132446	so that
132447	it does not
132448	rain
132449	
132450	
132451	during the time
132452	
132453	they are prophesying.
132454	
132455	
132456	power
132457	They have
132458	
132459	
132460	the waters
132461	to turn
132462	
132463	to
132464	blood
132465	and
132466	to strike
132467	
132468	the earth
132469	with
132470	every kind
132471	of plague
132472	
132473	whenever
132474	they want.
132475	
132476	When
132477	they have completed
132478	
132479	their testimony,
132480	
132481	
132482	the beast
132483	
132484	that comes up
132485	from
132486	
132487	the abyss
132488	will make
132489	on them
132490	
132491	war
132492	
132493	and conquer them
132494	
132495	
132496	and kill them.
132497	
132498	
132499	
132500	Their corpses
132501	
132502	will lie in
132503	
132504	the street
132505	
132506	city
132507	
132508	of the great
132509	that
132510	called
132511	is symbolically
132512	Sodom
132513	
132514	and Egypt,
132515	where
132516	
132517	
132518	their Lord
132519	
132520	was also crucified.
132521	
132522	will look at
132523	those from
132524	
132525	every people,
132526	
132527	tribe,
132528	
132529	and language
132530	
132531	nation,
132532	
132533	their corpses,
132534	
132535	days
132536	For three
132537	
132538	and a half
132539	
132540	
132541	
132542	
132543	because they will not
132544	permit
132545	them to be placed
132546	in
132547	a tomb.
132548	
132549	
132550	And those who live
132551	on
132552	
132553	the earth
132554	will rejoice
132555	over them
132556	
132557	
132558	and celebrate,
132559	
132560	gifts
132561	even sending
132562	to each other,
132563	
132564	
132565	
132566	because these two
132567	prophets
132568	had tormented
132569	
132570	those who live
132571	on
132572	
132573	the earth.
132574	
132575	But after
132576	
132577	three
132578	days
132579	
132580	and a half
132581	a breath
132582	of life
132583	from
132584	
132585	God
132586	entered them,
132587	
132588	
132589	
132590	and they stood
132591	on
132592	
132593	their feet,
132594	
132595	
132596	fear
132597	and tremendous
132598	seized
132599	
132600	
132601	those who were watching them.
132602	
132603	
132604	Then they heard
132605	voice
132606	a loud
132607	from
132608	
132609	heaven
132610	saying to them:
132611	
132612	“Come up
132613	here!”
132614	
132615	So the two prophets went up
132616	to
132617	
132618	heaven
132619	in
132620	
132621	a cloud
132622	
132623	stared at them.
132624	
132625	
132626	while their enemies
132627	
132628	
132629	in
132630	
132631	
132632	
132633	took place
132634	earthquake
132635	Just then a major
132636	
132637	
132638	and a tenth
132639	
132640	of the city
132641	collapsed;
132642	
132643	were killed
132644	
132645	
132646	the earthquake,
132647	
132648	people
132649	thousand
132650	seven
132651	
132652	
132653	and the rest
132654	were terrified
132655	
132656	
132657	and gave
132658	glory
132659	
132660	to the God
132661	
132662	of heaven.
132663	
132664	woe
132665	
132666	The second
132667	has come and gone;
132668	
132669	
132670	
132671	
132672	the third
132673	is coming
132674	quickly.
132675	
132676	
132677	Then the seventh
132678	angel
132679	blew his trumpet,
132680	
132681	and there were
132682	voices
132683	loud
132684	in
132685	
132686	heaven
132687	saying:
132688	has become
132689	
132690	“The kingdom
132691	
132692	of the world
132693	the kingdom
132694	of our Lord
132695	
132696	
132697	
132698	and of his Christ,
132699	
132700	
132701	and he will reign
132702	for
132703	
132704	ever
132705	
132706	and ever.”
132707	
132708	
132709	Then the twenty-
132710	four
132711	elders
132712	
132713	before
132714	
132715	God
132716	who are seated
132717	on
132718	
132719	their thrones
132720	
132721	threw
132722	themselves down with
132723	
132724	their faces
132725	
132726	
132727	to the ground and worshiped
132728	
132729	God
132730	with these words:
132731	“We give you
132732	
132733	thanks, Lord
132734	
132735	God,
132736	
132737	the All-Powerful,
132738	
132739	the one who is
132740	
132741	
132742	and who was,
132743	
132744	because you have taken
132745	
132746	power
132747	
132748	
132749	your great
132750	
132751	and begun to reign.
132752	
132753	
132754	The nations
132755	were enraged,
132756	
132757	has come,
132758	
132759	but your wrath
132760	
132761	
132762	
132763	and the time
132764	
132765	has come for the dead
132766	to be judged,
132767	
132768	and the time has come to give
132769	
132770	their reward,
132771	
132772	to your servants,
132773	
132774	
132775	the prophets,
132776	
132777	
132778	as well as to the saints
132779	
132780	
132781	and to those who revere
132782	
132783	your name,
132784	
132785	
132786	both small
132787	
132788	
132789	and great,
132790	
132791	and the time has come to destroy
132792	
132793	those who destroy
132794	
132795	the earth.”
132796	
132797	was opened
132798	
132799	Then the temple
132800	
132801	of God
132802	
132803	in
132804	
132805	heaven
132806	
132807	was visible
132808	
132809	and the ark
132810	
132811	of his covenant
132812	
132813	within
132814	
132815	his temple.
132816	
132817	
132818	And there were
132819	flashes of lightning,
132820	
132821	roaring,
132822	
132823	crashes of thunder,
132824	
132825	an earthquake,
132826	
132827	hailstorm.
132828	and a great
132829	
132830	sign
132831	Then a great
132832	appeared
132833	in
132834	
132835	heaven:
132836	a woman
132837	clothed with
132838	
132839	the sun,
132840	
132841	
132842	and with the moon
132843	under
132844	
132845	her feet,
132846	
132847	
132848	and on
132849	
132850	her head
132851	
132852	was a crown
132853	stars.
132854	of twelve
132855	
132856	
132857	pregnant
132858	She was
132859	
132860	and was screaming
132861	in labor pains,
132862	
132863	struggling
132864	to give birth.
132865	
132866	appeared
132867	Then another
132868	sign
132869	in
132870	
132871	heaven:
132872	
132873	
132874	dragon
132875	a huge
132876	red
132877	that had
132878	heads
132879	seven
132880	
132881	horns,
132882	and ten
132883	
132884	and on
132885	
132886	its heads
132887	
132888	were seven
132889	diadem crowns.
132890	
132891	
132892	Now the dragon’s tail
132893	
132894	
132895	
132896	swept away a third
132897	
132898	of the stars
132899	
132900	in heaven
132901	
132902	and hurled them
132903	
132904	to
132905	
132906	the earth.
132907	
132908	
132909	Then the dragon
132910	stood
132911	before
132912	
132913	the woman
132914	
132915	who was about
132916	to give birth,
132917	so that
132918	as soon as
132919	it was born.
132920	
132921	her child
132922	
132923	he might devour
132924	
132925	So the woman gave birth
132926	to a son,
132927	a male child,
132928	who
132929	is going
132930	to rule
132931	over all
132932	
132933	the nations
132934	with
132935	rod.
132936	an iron
132937	
132938	was suddenly caught up
132939	
132940	Her child
132941	
132942	to
132943	
132944	God
132945	
132946	and to
132947	
132948	his throne,
132949	
132950	
132951	
132952	and she
132953	fled
132954	into
132955	
132956	the wilderness
132957	where
132958	
132959	
132960	a place
132961	had been prepared
132962	for her by
132963	
132964	God,
132965	so
132966	
132967	she could be taken care of
132968	
132969	days.
132970	
132971	
132972	for 1,260
132973	
132974	broke out
132975	Then war
132976	in
132977	
132978	heaven:
132979	
132980	Michael
132981	
132982	
132983	and his angels
132984	
132985	
132986	fought
132987	against
132988	
132989	the dragon,
132990	
132991	
132992	and the dragon
132993	fought back.
132994	
132995	
132996	and his angels
132997	
132998	
132999	But the dragon was not
133000	strong enough to prevail,
133001	so there was no
133002	any place
133003	left
133004	for him and his angels.
133005	longer
133006	in
133007	
133008	heaven
133009	
133010	was thrown down
133011	
133012	dragon –
133013	
133014	So that huge
133015	
133016	serpent,
133017	
133018	the ancient
133019	
133020	the one called
133021	the devil
133022	
133023	
133024	and Satan,
133025	
133026	who deceives
133027	
133028	world –
133029	the whole
133030	
133031	to
133032	
133033	the earth,
133034	
133035	
133036	and his angels
133037	
133038	along with him.
133039	
133040	
133041	
133042	Then I heard
133043	voice
133044	a loud
133045	in
133046	
133047	heaven
133048	saying,
133049	have now
133050	come,
133051	
133052	“The salvation
133053	
133054	
133055	and the power
133056	
133057	
133058	and the kingdom
133059	
133060	of our God,
133061	
133062	
133063	
133064	and the ruling authority
133065	
133066	of his Christ,
133067	
133068	
133069	has been thrown down.
133070	
133071	because the accuser
133072	
133073	of our brothers and sisters,
133074	
133075	the one who
133076	accuses them
133077	
133078	before
133079	
133080	our God,
133081	
133082	day
133083	
133084	and night
133085	
133086	
133087	But they overcame him
133088	
133089	by
133090	
133091	the blood
133092	
133093	of the Lamb
133094	
133095	and by
133096	
133097	the word
133098	
133099	
133100	
133101	
133102	of their testimony, and they did not
133103	love
133104	
133105	their lives
133106	
133107	so much that they were afraid to
133108	die.
133109	
133110	Therefore
133111	rejoice,
133112	
133113	you heavens
133114	
133115	
133116	in them!
133117	
133118	and all who reside
133119	But woe
133120	
133121	to the earth
133122	
133123	
133124	and the sea
133125	
133126	come down
133127	
133128	because the devil
133129	to
133130	
133131	has
133132	anger,
133133	with terrible
133134	for he knows
133135	
133136	that he only has a little
133137	time!”
133138	you! He is filled
133139	
133140	Now when
133141	realized
133142	
133143	the dragon
133144	
133145	that he had been thrown down
133146	to
133147	
133148	the earth,
133149	he pursued
133150	
133151	the woman
133152	who
133153	had given birth
133154	
133155	to the male child.
133156	
133157	was given
133158	
133159	But the woman
133160	
133161	the two
133162	wings
133163	
133164	eagle
133165	
133166	of a giant
133167	so that
133168	she could fly
133169	out into
133170	
133171	the wilderness,
133172	to
133173	
133174	the place God prepared for her,
133175	
133176	where
133177	she is taken care of –
133178	
133179	for a time,
133180	
133181	times,
133182	
133183	and half
133184	a time.
133185	away from
133186	the presence
133187	
133188	of the serpent –
133189	
133190	spouted
133191	
133192	Then the serpent
133193	out of
133194	
133195	his mouth
133196	
133197	after
133198	
133199	the woman
133200	water
133201	like
133202	a river
133203	to
133204	
133205	sweep her away by a flood,
133206	in an attempt
133207	
133208	came to
133209	
133210	but the earth
133211	
133212	her
133213	
133214	opened up
133215	
133216	rescue; the ground
133217	
133218	his mouth.
133219	
133220	
133221	and swallowed
133222	
133223	the river
133224	that
133225	had spewed
133226	
133227	the dragon
133228	from
133229	
133230	
133231	
133232	
133233	became enraged
133234	
133235	So the dragon
133236	at
133237	
133238	the woman
133239	
133240	and went away
133241	to make
133242	war
133243	on
133244	
133245	the rest
133246	
133247	of her children,
133248	
133249	
133250	those who keep
133251	
133252	commandments
133253	
133254	God’s
133255	
133256	and hold
133257	
133258	to the testimony
133259	about Jesus.
133260	
133261	And the dragon stood
133262	
133263	
133264	on the sand
133265	
133266	of the seashore.
133267	
133268	Then I saw
133269	out of
133270	
133271	the sea.
133272	a beast
133273	coming up
133274	It had
133275	horns
133276	ten
133277	
133278	heads,
133279	and seven
133280	
133281	and on
133282	
133283	its horns
133284	
133285	were ten
133286	diadem crowns,
133287	
133288	and on
133289	
133290	its heads
133291	
133292	name.
133293	a blasphemous
133294	
133295	
133296	Now the beast
133297	that
133298	I saw
133299	was
133300	
133301	a leopard,
133302	
133303	
133304	but its feet
133305	
133306	like
133307	a bear’s,
133308	
133309	
133310	and its mouth
133311	
133312	were like
133313	mouth.
133314	was like a lion’s
133315	
133316	gave
133317	
133318	
133319	The dragon
133320	
133321	the beast his power,
133322	
133323	
133324	
133325	his throne,
133326	
133327	
133328	authority to rule.
133329	and great
133330	
133331	One
133332	of
133333	
133334	the beast’s heads
133335	
133336	appeared
133337	to have been killed,
133338	
133339	but the lethal
133340	
133341	
133342	wound
133343	
133344	
133345	
133346	had been healed.
133347	
133348	in amazement;
133349	And the whole
133350	
133351	world
133352	followed
133353	
133354	the beast
133355	
133356	they worshiped
133357	
133358	the dragon
133359	
133360	because he had given
133361	
133362	ruling authority
133363	
133364	to the beast,
133365	
133366	and they worshiped
133367	
133368	the beast
133369	too, saying:
133370	“Who
133371	is like
133372	
133373	the beast?”
133374	
133375	and “Who
133376	is able
133377	to make war
133378	against him?”
133379	
133380	
133381	The beast was given
133382	
133383	a mouth
133384	speaking
133385	proud
133386	
133387	words and blasphemies,
133388	
133389	and he was permitted
133390	
133391	
133392	to exercise
133393	months.
133394	ruling authority for forty-
133395	
133396	two
133397	
133398	So the beast opened
133399	
133400	his mouth
133401	
133402	to
133403	blaspheme
133404	against
133405	
133406	God –
133407	to blaspheme
133408	
133409	both his name
133410	
133411	
133412	
133413	and his dwelling place,
133414	
133415	
133416	in
133417	
133418	heaven.
133419	that is, those who dwell
133420	
133421	The beast was permitted
133422	
133423	to go
133424	to war
133425	against
133426	
133427	the saints
133428	
133429	and conquer them.
133430	
133431	
133432	He was given
133433	
133434	ruling authority
133435	over
133436	every
133437	tribe,
133438	
133439	people,
133440	
133441	language,
133442	
133443	and nation,
133444	
133445	will worship
133446	
133447	and all
133448	
133449	those who live
133450	on
133451	
133452	the earth
133453	the beast, everyone whose
133454	has not
133455	been written
133456	
133457	name
133458	
133459	in
133460	
133461	the book
133462	
133463	of life
133464	
133465	belonging to the Lamb
133466	
133467	who was killed.
133468	since
133469	the foundation
133470	of the world
133471	If
133472	anyone
133473	has
133474	an ear,
133475	he had better listen!
133476	If
133477	anyone
133478	is meant for
133479	captivity,
133480	into
133481	captivity
133482	he will go.
133483	If
133484	anyone
133485	by
133486	the sword,
133487	is to be killed
133488	
133489	then by
133490	the sword
133491	he must be killed.
133492	This
133493	requires
133494	
133495	steadfast endurance
133496	
133497	
133498	and faith
133499	
133500	from the saints.
133501	
133502	Then I saw
133503	another
133504	beast
133505	coming up
133506	from
133507	
133508	the earth.
133509	
133510	He had
133511	horns
133512	two
133513	like
133514	a lamb,
133515	
133516	but was speaking
133517	like
133518	a dragon.
133519	
133520	
133521	the ruling authority
133522	
133523	of the first
133524	beast
133525	all
133526	He exercised
133527	on
133528	
133529	
133530	his behalf, and made
133531	
133532	the earth
133533	
133534	
133535	
133536	
133537	and those who inhabit
133538	
133539	it worship
133540	
133541	beast,
133542	
133543	the first
133544	the one whose
133545	had been healed.
133546	
133547	wound
133548	
133549	lethal
133550	
133551	
133552	He performed
133553	signs,
133554	momentous
133555	
133556	
133557	fire
133558	even making
133559	from
133560	
133561	heaven
133562	come down
133563	to
133564	
133565	earth
133566	in front of
133567	
133568	people
133569	
133570	he deceived
133571	
133572	those who live
133573	on
133574	
133575	the earth.
133576	and, by
133577	
133578	the signs
133579	those who
133580	he was permitted
133581	
133582	to perform
133583	behalf
133584	
133585	of the beast,
133586	He told
133587	
133588	live
133589	on
133590	
133591	on the earth
133592	to make
133593	an image
133594	
133595	to the beast
133596	who
133597	had
133598	
133599	been wounded
133600	
133601	by the sword,
133602	
133603	but still lived.
133604	
133605	The second beast was empowered
133606	
133607	to give
133608	life
133609	
133610	to the image
133611	
133612	of the first beast
133613	so that
133614	
133615	it could speak,
133616	
133617	the image
133618	
133619	of the beast
133620	
133621	and could cause
133622	
133623	all
133624	
133625	those who did not
133626	worship
133627	
133628	
133629	
133630	
133631	to be killed.
133632	
133633	He
133634	also caused everyone
133635	
133636	(small
133637	
133638	
133639	and great,
133640	
133641	
133642	rich
133643	
133644	
133645	and poor,
133646	
133647	
133648	free
133649	
133650	
133651	and slave)
133652	to
133653	obtain
133654	
133655	a mark
133656	on
133657	
133658	hand
133659	
133660	
133661	their right
133662	or
133663	on
133664	
133665	their forehead.
133666	
133667	
133668	
133669	Thus no
133670	one
133671	was allowed
133672	to buy
133673	or
133674	sell
133675	
133676	things unless
133677	
133678	he bore
133679	
133680	the mark
133681	
133682	that is, his name
133683	
133684	of the beast –
133685	or
133686	
133687	his number.
133688	
133689	
133690	
133691	This
133692	
133693	for wisdom:
133694	calls
133695	
133696	Let the one who has
133697	insight
133698	calculate
133699	
133700	number,
133701	
133702	the beast’s
133703	number,
133704	for
133705	man’s
133706	it is
133707	
133708	
133709	and his number
133710	
133711	
133712	
133713	is 666.
133714	
133715	Then I looked,
133716	
133717	and here
133718	
133719	was the Lamb
133720	standing
133721	on
133722	
133723	Mount
133724	Zion,
133725	
133726	and with him
133727	
133728	were one hundred
133729	and forty-
133730	four
133731	thousand,
133732	who had
133733	
133734	his name
133735	
133736	
133737	
133738	name
133739	
133740	and his Father’s
133741	
133742	written
133743	on
133744	
133745	their foreheads.
133746	
133747	
133748	I also heard
133749	a sound
133750	coming out of
133751	
133752	heaven
133753	like
133754	the sound
133755	waters
133756	of many
133757	
133758	and like
133759	the sound
133760	thunder.
133761	of loud
133762	
133763	
133764	Now the sound
133765	
133766	I heard
133767	was like
133768	that made by harpists
133769	playing
133770	
133771	
133772	their harps,
133773	
133774	
133775	and they were singing
133776	
133777	song
133778	a new
133779	before
133780	
133781	the throne
133782	
133783	and before
133784	
133785	the four
133786	living creatures
133787	
133788	
133789	and the elders.
133790	
133791	No one
133792	was able
133793	to learn
133794	
133795	the song
133796	
133797	except
133798	
133799	the one hundred
133800	and forty-
133801	four
133802	thousand
133803	
133804	who had been redeemed
133805	from
133806	
133807	the earth.
133808	
133809	These are
133810	
133811	themselves with
133812	women,
133813	the ones who have not
133814	defiled
133815	virgins.
133816	for
133817	they are
133818	
133819	
133820	These are the ones who follow
133821	
133822	the Lamb
133823	wherever
133824	
133825	he goes.
133826	
133827	These were redeemed
133828	from
133829	
133830	humanity
133831	as firstfruits
133832	
133833	to God
133834	
133835	
133836	and to the Lamb,
133837	
133838	on
133839	
133840	their lips;
133841	
133842	and no
133843	was found
133844	lie
133845	blameless.
133846	they are
133847	
133848	Then I saw
133849	another
133850	angel
133851	flying
133852	directly
133853	overhead,
133854	and he had
133855	gospel
133856	an eternal
133857	to proclaim
133858	to
133859	
133860	those who live
133861	on
133862	
133863	the earth –
133864	
133865	to
133866	every
133867	nation,
133868	
133869	tribe,
133870	
133871	language,
133872	
133873	and people.
133874	He declared
133875	in
133876	voice:
133877	a loud
133878	“Fear
133879	
133880	God
133881	
133882	and give him
133883	
133884	glory,
133885	
133886	has arrived,
133887	
133888	because the hour
133889	
133890	of his judgment
133891	
133892	
133893	and worship
133894	
133895	the one who made
133896	
133897	heaven
133898	
133899	
133900	and earth,
133901	
133902	the sea
133903	
133904	and the springs
133905	of water!”
133906	
133907	
133908	angel
133909	A second
133910	followed
133911	the first, declaring:
133912	“Fallen,
133913	fallen
133914	is Babylon
133915	
133916	the great
133917	
133918	drink of
133919	
133920	the wine
133921	
133922	passion.”
133923	
133924	of her immoral
133925	
133926	city! She made
133927	all
133928	
133929	the nations
133930	
133931	
133932	angel
133933	A third
133934	followed
133935	
133936	the first two, declaring
133937	in
133938	voice:
133939	a loud
133940	“If
133941	anyone
133942	worships
133943	
133944	the beast
133945	
133946	
133947	and his image,
133948	
133949	
133950	and takes
133951	the mark
133952	on
133953	
133954	his forehead
133955	
133956	or
133957	
133958	
133959	his hand,
133960	
133961	
133962	
133963	that person will also drink
133964	
133965	
133966	of the wine
133967	
133968	anger
133969	
133970	of God’s
133971	
133972	that has been mixed
133973	undiluted
133974	in
133975	
133976	the cup
133977	
133978	of his wrath,
133979	
133980	
133981	and he will be tortured
133982	with
133983	fire
133984	
133985	and sulfur
133986	in front of
133987	angels
133988	the holy
133989	
133990	and in front of
133991	
133992	the Lamb.
133993	
133994	
133995	And the smoke
133996	
133997	from their torture
133998	
133999	
134000	forever
134001	and ever,
134002	will go up
134003	
134004	no
134005	will have
134006	rest
134007	day
134008	
134009	or night,
134010	
134011	and those who worship
134012	
134013	the beast
134014	
134015	
134016	and his image
134017	
134018	
134019	
134020	along with anyone
134021	who receives
134022	
134023	the mark
134024	
134025	of his name.”
134026	
134027	This
134028	
134029	the steadfast endurance
134030	
134031	of the saints –
134032	requires
134033	
134034	those who obey
134035	
134036	commandments
134037	
134038	God’s
134039	
134040	
134041	and hold to their faith
134042	in Jesus.
134043	
134044	Then I heard
134045	a voice
134046	from
134047	
134048	heaven
134049	say,
134050	“Write
134051	this: ‘Blessed
134052	
134053	are the dead,
134054	
134055	in
134056	the Lord
134057	those who die
134058	from
134059	this moment on!’”
134060	“Yes,”
134061	says
134062	
134063	the Spirit,
134064	“so
134065	they can rest
134066	from
134067	
134068	their hard work,
134069	
134070	
134071	because
134072	their deeds
134073	
134074	will follow them.”
134075	
134076	
134077	
134078	Then I looked,
134079	
134080	appeared,
134081	cloud
134082	and a white
134083	
134084	on
134085	
134086	the cloud
134087	and seated
134088	was one like
134089	a son
134090	of man!
134091	He had
134092	on
134093	
134094	his head
134095	
134096	crown
134097	a golden
134098	
134099	in
134100	
134101	his hand.
134102	
134103	sickle
134104	and a sharp
134105	
134106	Then another
134107	angel
134108	came out
134109	of
134110	
134111	the temple,
134112	shouting
134113	in
134114	voice
134115	a loud
134116	
134117	to the one seated
134118	on
134119	
134120	the cloud,
134121	“Use
134122	
134123	your sickle
134124	
134125	
134126	and start to reap,
134127	
134128	has come,
134129	
134130	because the time
134131	to reap
134132	
134133	is ripe!”
134134	
134135	harvest
134136	
134137	since the earth’s
134138	
134139	swung
134140	
134141	So the one seated
134142	on
134143	
134144	the cloud
134145	
134146	his sickle
134147	
134148	over
134149	
134150	the earth,
134151	
134152	was reaped.
134153	
134154	and the earth
134155	
134156	Then another
134157	angel
134158	came out
134159	of
134160	
134161	the temple
134162	
134163	in
134164	
134165	heaven,
134166	and he too had
134167	
134168	
134169	sickle.
134170	a sharp
134171	
134172	Another
134173	angel,
134174	came
134175	from
134176	
134177	the altar
134178	
134179	who was
134180	in charge
134181	of
134182	
134183	the fire,
134184	
134185	and called
134186	voice
134187	in a loud
134188	
134189	to the angel who had
134190	
134191	sickle,
134192	
134193	the sharp
134194	
134195	“Use
134196	
134197	
134198	sickle
134199	
134200	your sharp
134201	
134202	and gather
134203	
134204	the clusters of grapes
134205	
134206	off the vine
134207	
134208	of the earth,
134209	
134210	are now ripe.”
134211	
134212	because its grapes
134213	
134214	
134215	swung
134216	
134217	So the angel
134218	
134219	his sickle
134220	
134221	over
134222	
134223	the earth
134224	
134225	and gathered
134226	
134227	the grapes from the vineyard
134228	
134229	of the earth
134230	
134231	and tossed
134232	them into
134233	
134234	winepress
134235	
134236	of the wrath
134237	
134238	of God.
134239	
134240	the great
134241	
134242	was stomped
134243	
134244	Then the winepress
134245	outside
134246	
134247	the city,
134248	
134249	poured out
134250	and blood
134251	of
134252	
134253	the winepress
134254	up to
134255	
134256	bridles
134257	
134258	the height of horses’
134259	for
134260	
134261	
134262	a distance of almost two hundred miles.
134263	
134264	Then I saw
134265	another
134266	sign
134267	in
134268	
134269	heaven:
134270	great
134271	
134272	and astounding
134273	angels
134274	seven
134275	who have
134276	plagues
134277	seven
134278	
134279	final
134280	
134281	(they are final because in them
134282	
134283	is completed).
134284	
134285	anger
134286	
134287	God’s
134288	
134289	Then I saw
134290	something like
134291	a sea
134292	of glass
134293	mixed
134294	with fire,
134295	
134296	
134297	and those who had conquered
134298	
134299	
134300	the beast
134301	
134302	
134303	
134304	and his image
134305	
134306	
134307	
134308	
134309	and the number
134310	
134311	of his name.
134312	
134313	They were standing
134314	by
134315	
134316	the sea
134317	
134318	of glass,
134319	holding
134320	harps
134321	
134322	given to them by God.
134323	
134324	They sang
134325	
134326	the song
134327	of Moses
134328	
134329	the servant
134330	
134331	of God
134332	
134333	
134334	and the song
134335	
134336	of the Lamb:
134337	
134338	“Great
134339	
134340	and astounding
134341	
134342	are your deeds,
134343	
134344	Lord
134345	
134346	God,
134347	
134348	the All-Powerful!
134349	Just
134350	
134351	and true
134352	
134353	are your ways,
134354	
134355	
134356	King over the nations!
134357	
134358	
134359	Who
134360	
134361	will not
134362	fear
134363	you, O Lord,
134364	
134365	and glorify
134366	
134367	your name,
134368	
134369	
134370	because you alone
134371	are holy?
134372	
134373	All
134374	
134375	nations
134376	will come
134377	
134378	and worship
134379	before you
134380	
134381	
134382	
134383	for your righteous acts
134384	
134385	have been revealed.”
134386	
134387	After
134388	
134389	these things I looked,
134390	
134391	was opened
134392	
134393	and the temple
134394	
134395	(the tent
134396	
134397	of the testimony)
134398	in
134399	
134400	heaven,
134401	
134402	came out
134403	
134404	and the seven
134405	angels
134406	
134407	who had
134408	
134409	the seven
134410	plagues
134411	of
134412	
134413	the temple,
134414	dressed in
134415	linen,
134416	clean
134417	bright
134418	
134419	wearing
134420	around
134421	
134422	their chests.
134423	belts
134424	wide golden
134425	
134426	Then one
134427	of
134428	
134429	the four
134430	living creatures
134431	gave
134432	
134433	the seven
134434	angels
134435	seven
134436	bowls
134437	golden
134438	filled
134439	
134440	with the wrath
134441	
134442	of God
134443	
134444	who lives
134445	
134446	
134447	forever
134448	
134449	and ever,
134450	
134451	was filled
134452	
134453	and the temple
134454	with smoke
134455	from
134456	
134457	glory
134458	
134459	God’s
134460	
134461	and from
134462	
134463	his power.
134464	
134465	
134466	Thus no one
134467	could
134468	enter
134469	
134470	
134471	the temple
134472	until
134473	were completed.
134474	
134475	the seven
134476	plagues
134477	
134478	from the seven
134479	angels
134480	
134481	Then I heard
134482	a loud
134483	voice
134484	from
134485	
134486	the temple
134487	declaring
134488	
134489	to the seven
134490	angels:
134491	“Go
134492	
134493	and pour out
134494	
134495	the seven
134496	bowls
134497	
134498	wrath.”
134499	
134500	containing God’s
134501	on
134502	
134503	the earth
134504	
134505	angel went
134506	
134507	So the first
134508	
134509	and poured out
134510	
134511	his bowl
134512	
134513	on
134514	
134515	the earth.
134516	
134517	appeared
134518	sores
134519	Then ugly
134520	
134521	and painful
134522	on
134523	
134524	the people
134525	
134526	who had
134527	
134528	the mark
134529	
134530	of the beast
134531	
134532	
134533	and who worshiped
134534	
134535	his image.
134536	
134537	
134538	
134539	Next, the second
134540	angel poured out
134541	
134542	his bowl
134543	
134544	on
134545	
134546	the sea
134547	
134548	and it turned
134549	into blood,
134550	like
134551	that of a corpse,
134552	
134553	and every
134554	creature
134555	living
134556	died.
134557	
134558	that was in
134559	
134560	the sea
134561	
134562	
134563	Then the third
134564	angel poured out
134565	
134566	his bowl
134567	
134568	on
134569	
134570	the rivers
134571	
134572	
134573	and the springs
134574	
134575	of water,
134576	
134577	and they turned into
134578	blood.
134579	
134580	Now I heard
134581	
134582	the angel
134583	
134584	of the waters
134585	saying:
134586	just –
134587	“You are
134588	
134589	the one who is
134590	
134591	
134592	and who was,
134593	
134594	the Holy One –
134595	
134596	
134597	because you have passed these judgments,
134598	
134599	the blood
134600	of your saints
134601	
134602	and prophets,
134603	because they poured out
134604	
134605	blood
134606	
134607	so you have given them
134608	to drink.
134609	what they deserved!”
134610	They got
134611	
134612	Then I heard
134613	
134614	the altar
134615	reply,
134616	
134617	“Yes, Lord
134618	
134619	God,
134620	
134621	the All-Powerful,
134622	are true
134623	
134624	and just!”
134625	
134626	your judgments
134627	
134628	
134629	
134630	Then the fourth
134631	angel poured out
134632	
134633	his bowl
134634	
134635	on
134636	
134637	the sun,
134638	
134639	and it was permitted
134640	
134641	to scorch
134642	
134643	people
134644	with
134645	fire.
134646	
134647	were scorched
134648	
134649	Thus people
134650	heat,
134651	by the terrible
134652	
134653	yet they blasphemed
134654	
134655	the name
134656	
134657	of God,
134658	
134659	who has
134660	
134661	ruling authority
134662	over
134663	
134664	these plagues,
134665	
134666	
134667	and they would not
134668	repent
134669	and give him
134670	
134671	glory.
134672	
134673	
134674	Then the fifth
134675	angel poured out
134676	
134677	his bowl
134678	
134679	on
134680	
134681	the throne
134682	
134683	of the beast
134684	
134685	covered
134686	
134687	his kingdom,
134688	
134689	so that darkness
134690	
134691	and people began to bite
134692	
134693	their tongues
134694	
134695	because of
134696	
134697	their pain.
134698	
134699	They blasphemed
134700	
134701	the God
134702	
134703	of heaven
134704	because of
134705	
134706	their sufferings
134707	
134708	
134709	and because of
134710	
134711	their sores,
134712	
134713	
134714	but nevertheless
134715	they still refused to repent
134716	of
134717	
134718	their deeds.
134719	
134720	
134721	
134722	Then the sixth
134723	angel poured out
134724	
134725	his bowl
134726	
134727	on
134728	
134729	river
134730	
134731	the great
134732	
134733	Euphrates
134734	
134735	and dried up
134736	
134737	its water
134738	
134739	to
134740	prepare
134741	
134742	the way
134743	
134744	for the kings
134745	
134746	from
134747	
134748	the east.
134749	
134750	Then I saw
134751	coming out of
134752	
134753	the mouth
134754	
134755	of the dragon,
134756	
134757	out of
134758	
134759	the mouth
134760	
134761	of the beast,
134762	
134763	and out of
134764	
134765	the mouth
134766	
134767	of the false prophet.
134768	spirits
134769	three
134770	unclean
134771	that looked like
134772	frogs
134773	they are
134774	For
134775	the spirits
134776	of the demons
134777	performing
134778	signs
134779	who
134780	go out
134781	to
134782	
134783	the kings
134784	
134785	of the earth
134786	
134787	to bring them
134788	
134789	together for
134790	
134791	the battle
134792	
134793	day
134794	
134795	that will take place on the great
134796	
134797	of God,
134798	
134799	the All-Powerful.
134800	(Look!
134801	I will come
134802	like
134803	a thief!
134804	Blessed
134805	
134806	is the one who stays alert
134807	
134808	and does not lose
134809	
134810	his clothes
134811	
134812	so that
134813	not
134814	have to walk around naked
134815	he will
134816	
134817	be seen.)
134818	
134819	and his shameful condition
134820	
134821	
134822	Now the spirits gathered
134823	
134824	the kings and their armies to
134825	
134826	the place
134827	
134828	that is called
134829	in Hebrew.
134830	Armageddon
134831	
134832	
134833	Finally the seventh
134834	angel poured out
134835	
134836	his bowl
134837	
134838	into
134839	
134840	the air
134841	
134842	came out
134843	voice
134844	and a loud
134845	of
134846	
134847	the temple
134848	from
134849	
134850	the throne,
134851	saying:
134852	“It is done!”
134853	
134854	Then there were
134855	flashes of lightning,
134856	
134857	roaring,
134858	
134859	and crashes of thunder,
134860	
134861	earthquake –
134862	and there was
134863	a tremendous
134864	
134865	an earthquake unequaled
134866	has been
134867	since
134868	
134869	humanity
134870	
134871	on
134872	
134873	the earth,
134874	
134875	was that earthquake.
134876	so
134877	tremendous
134878	
134879	was split
134880	
134881	city
134882	
134883	The great
134884	into
134885	three
134886	parts
134887	
134888	
134889	and the cities
134890	
134891	of the nations
134892	collapsed.
134893	
134894	So Babylon
134895	
134896	the great
134897	was remembered
134898	before
134899	
134900	God,
134901	and was given
134902	
134903	
134904	the cup
134905	
134906	filled with the wine
134907	
134908	made of God’s furious
134909	
134910	wrath.
134911	
134912	
134913	Every
134914	island
134915	fled away
134916	
134917	mountains
134918	and no
134919	could be found.
134920	
134921	hailstones,
134922	And gigantic
134923	about
134924	weighing
134925	a hundred pounds each, fell
134926	from
134927	
134928	heaven
134929	on
134930	
134931	people,
134932	
134933	blasphemed
134934	
134935	but they
134936	
134937	God
134938	because of
134939	
134940	the plague
134941	
134942	of hail,
134943	
134944	
134945	since it was
134946	
134947	
134948	
134949	so horrendous.
134950	
134951	came
134952	Then one
134953	of
134954	
134955	the seven
134956	angels
134957	
134958	who had
134959	
134960	the seven
134961	bowls
134962	
134963	and spoke
134964	to me.
134965	
134966	he said,
134967	“Come,”
134968	“I will show you
134969	
134970	
134971	the condemnation and punishment
134972	
134973	prostitute
134974	
134975	of the great
134976	
134977	who sits
134978	on
134979	waters,
134980	many
134981	with
134982	whom
134983	committed sexual immorality
134984	
134985	the kings
134986	
134987	of the earth
134988	
134989	
134990	
134991	inhabitants
134992	
134993	and the earth’s
134994	got drunk with
134995	
134996	the wine
134997	
134998	of her immorality.”
134999	
135000	
135001	So he carried me
135002	
135003	to
135004	a wilderness,
135005	away in
135006	the Spirit
135007	
135008	and there I saw
135009	a woman
135010	sitting
135011	on
135012	beast
135013	a scarlet
135014	that was full
135015	names
135016	of blasphemous
135017	and had
135018	heads
135019	seven
135020	
135021	horns.
135022	and ten
135023	
135024	
135025	Now the woman
135026	was
135027	dressed
135028	in purple
135029	
135030	and scarlet clothing,
135031	
135032	and adorned
135033	with gold,
135034	
135035	stones,
135036	precious
135037	
135038	and pearls.
135039	She held
135040	cup
135041	a golden
135042	in
135043	
135044	her hand
135045	
135046	filled
135047	with detestable things
135048	
135049	
135050	and unclean things
135051	
135052	from her sexual immorality.
135053	
135054	
135055	On
135056	
135057	her forehead
135058	
135059	a name,
135060	was written
135061	a mystery:
135062	“Babylon
135063	
135064	the Great,
135065	
135066	the Mother
135067	
135068	of prostitutes
135069	
135070	
135071	and of the detestable things
135072	
135073	of the earth.”
135074	
135075	I saw
135076	
135077	that the woman
135078	was drunk
135079	with
135080	
135081	the blood
135082	
135083	of the saints
135084	
135085	
135086	
135087	and the blood
135088	
135089	of those who testified
135090	to Jesus.
135091	
135092	astounded
135093	when I saw her.
135094	
135095	
135096	I was greatly
135097	
135098	said to me,
135099	
135100	
135101	But the angel
135102	
135103	“Why
135104	are you astounded?
135105	
135106	I will interpret
135107	
135108	
135109	for you the mystery
135110	
135111	of the woman
135112	
135113	
135114	and of the beast
135115	
135116	that carries her.
135117	
135118	
135119	with
135120	
135121	the seven
135122	heads
135123	
135124	
135125	and ten
135126	horns
135127	
135128	The beast
135129	all those whose
135130	you saw
135131	was,
135132	
135133	not,
135134	and is
135135	
135136	but is about to
135137	come up
135138	from
135139	
135140	the abyss
135141	
135142	to
135143	destruction.
135144	and then go
135145	
135146	will be astounded
135147	
135148	The inhabitants
135149	of
135150	
135151	the earth –
135152	
135153	have not
135154	been written
135155	
135156	names
135157	in
135158	
135159	the book
135160	
135161	of life
135162	since
135163	the foundation
135164	of the world –
135165	when they see
135166	
135167	that the beast
135168	
135169	was,
135170	and
135171	is not,
135172	but is
135173	
135174	to come.
135175	(This
135176	
135177	requires a mind
135178	
135179	that has
135180	wisdom.)
135181	
135182	The seven
135183	heads
135184	seven
135185	mountains
135186	are
135187	
135188	
135189	the woman
135190	sits
135191	on.
135192	
135193	
135194	kings:
135195	also seven
135196	They are
135197	
135198	five
135199	have fallen;
135200	
135201	one
135202	is,
135203	
135204	and the other
135205	not yet
135206	has
135207	
135208	but whenever
135209	come,
135210	for only a brief time.
135211	
135212	he does come, he must
135213	remain
135214	
135215	
135216	The beast
135217	that
135218	was,
135219	
135220	not,
135221	and is
135222	
135223	
135224	an eighth
135225	is himself
135226	
135227	one of
135228	
135229	the seven,
135230	king and yet is
135231	
135232	to
135233	destruction.
135234	and is going
135235	
135236	
135237	The ten
135238	horns
135239	that
135240	you saw
135241	ten
135242	kings
135243	are
135244	who
135245	a kingdom,
135246	have not yet
135247	received
135248	but
135249	
135250	as
135251	ruling authority
135252	for one
135253	hour.
135254	will receive
135255	kings with
135256	
135257	the beast
135258	
135259	a single
135260	intent,
135261	These kings have
135262	
135263	
135264	their power
135265	
135266	and authority
135267	
135268	
135269	to the beast.
135270	and they will give
135271	
135272	with
135273	
135274	the Lamb,
135275	They will make war
135276	
135277	
135278	but the Lamb
135279	will conquer them,
135280	
135281	
135282	Lord
135283	of lords
135284	because he is
135285	
135286	and King
135287	of kings,
135288	
135289	
135290	and those accompanying
135291	
135292	the Lamb are the called,
135293	
135294	chosen,
135295	
135296	and faithful.”
135297	
135298	Then the angel said to me,
135299	
135300	
135301	“The waters
135302	
135303	you saw
135304	(where
135305	
135306	the prostitute
135307	is seated)
135308	peoples,
135309	
135310	multitudes,
135311	are
135312	
135313	nations,
135314	
135315	and languages.
135316	
135317	
135318	The ten
135319	horns
135320	that
135321	you saw,
135322	
135323	
135324	and the beast –
135325	
135326	these will hate
135327	
135328	the prostitute
135329	
135330	desolate
135331	and make her
135332	
135333	
135334	and naked.
135335	
135336	
135337	her flesh
135338	
135339	They will consume
135340	
135341	her up
135342	and burn
135343	with
135344	fire.
135345	
135346	For
135347	God
135348	has put
135349	into
135350	
135351	their minds
135352	
135353	to carry out
135354	
135355	his purpose
135356	
135357	
135358	by making
135359	a
135360	decision
135361	
135362	to give
135363	
135364	their royal power
135365	
135366	
135367	to the beast
135368	until
135369	are fulfilled.
135370	
135371	the words
135372	
135373	of God
135374	
135375	
135376	As for the woman
135377	
135378	you saw,
135379	she is
135380	
135381	city
135382	
135383	the great
135384	
135385	that has
135386	sovereignty
135387	over
135388	
135389	the kings
135390	
135391	of the earth.”
135392	After
135393	
135394	these things I saw
135395	another
135396	angel,
135397	coming down
135398	out of
135399	
135400	heaven,
135401	who possessed
135402	authority,
135403	great
135404	
135405	
135406	and the earth
135407	was lit up
135408	by
135409	
135410	his radiance.
135411	
135412	
135413	He shouted
135414	with
135415	a powerful
135416	voice:
135417	
135418	“Fallen,
135419	fallen,
135420	is Babylon
135421	
135422	the great!
135423	
135424	She has become
135425	a lair
135426	for demons,
135427	
135428	a haunt
135429	for every
135430	spirit,
135431	unclean
135432	
135433	a haunt
135434	for every
135435	bird,
135436	unclean
135437	
135438	a haunt
135439	for every
135440	beast.
135441	unclean
135442	
135443	and detested
135444	
135445	have fallen from
135446	
135447	the wine
135448	
135449	passion,
135450	
135451	of her immoral
135452	
135453	
135454	For all
135455	
135456	the nations
135457	
135458	
135459	and the kings
135460	
135461	of the earth
135462	with her,
135463	
135464	have committed sexual immorality
135465	
135466	
135467	and the merchants
135468	
135469	of the earth
135470	from
135471	
135472	the power
135473	
135474	of her sensual behavior.”
135475	
135476	have gotten rich
135477	
135478	Then I heard
135479	another
135480	voice
135481	from
135482	
135483	heaven
135484	saying,
135485	“Come out
135486	
135487	my people,
135488	
135489	of her,
135490	
135491	so
135492	you will not
135493	take part in
135494	
135495	her sins
135496	
135497	
135498	
135499	
135500	receive her plagues,
135501	
135502	and so
135503	not
135504	you will
135505	
135506	have piled up
135507	
135508	
135509	because her sins
135510	all the way to
135511	
135512	heaven
135513	
135514	has remembered
135515	
135516	and God
135517	
135518	her crimes.
135519	
135520	Repay her
135521	
135522	the same way
135523	
135524	
135525	she repaid
135526	
135527	others; pay her
135528	
135529	back double
135530	corresponding to
135531	
135532	her deeds.
135533	
135534	In
135535	
135536	the cup
135537	
135538	she mixed,
135539	mix
135540	
135541	double the amount for her.
135542	As much as
135543	she exalted
135544	
135545	
135546	and lived in sensual luxury,
135547	to this extent
135548	give her
135549	herself,
135550	torment
135551	
135552	and grief
135553	
135554	to
135555	
135556	herself
135557	
135558	because she said
135559	
135560	‘I rule
135561	as queen
135562	
135563	widow;
135564	no
135565	and am
135566	
135567	experience grief!’
135568	
135569	never
135570	I will
135571	For
135572	
135573	in
135574	a single
135575	day:
135576	this reason, she will experience
135577	
135578	her plagues
135579	
135580	disease,
135581	
135582	mourning,
135583	
135584	and famine,
135585	
135586	with
135587	fire,
135588	and she will be burned down
135589	
135590	is powerful!”
135591	because the Lord
135592	
135593	God
135594	
135595	who judges her
135596	
135597	
135598	will weep
135599	
135600	and wail
135601	for her
135602	
135603	
135604	Then the kings
135605	
135606	of the earth
135607	
135608	with her
135609	
135610	who committed immoral acts
135611	
135612	and lived in sensual luxury with her
135613	when
135614	they see
135615	
135616	the smoke
135617	
135618	from the fire that burns
135619	her up.
135620	off
135621	a long way
135622	They will stand

135625	they are afraid
135626	
135627	of her torment,
135628	
135629	and will say,

135646	your doom

135653	will weep
135654

135832	the smoke

135834	from the fire that burned her

135836	
135837	up, “Who

135841	
135842	the great

135846	on
135847	
135848	their heads
135849	
135850	
135851	and were shouting

135856	“Woe,

135902	
135903	
135904	picked up
135905	Then one
135906	angel
135907	powerful
135908	a stone
135909	like
135910	millstone,
135911	a huge
135912	
135913	threw it
135914	into
135915	
135916	the sea,
135917	and said,
135918	
135919	“With this kind of sudden violent force

135930	
135931	And the sound
135932	of the harpists,
135933	
135934	musicians,
135935	
135936	flute players,
135937

135953	in you
135954	
135955	again;
135956	
135957	the noise
135958	of a mill
135959	
135960	will never
135961	be heard
135962	in you
135963	
135964	again.
135965	
135966	Even the light
135967	from a lamp
135968	
135969	will never
135970	shine
135971	in you
135972	
135973	again!
135974	
135975	The voices
135976	of the bridegroom
135977	
135978	and his bride
135979	
135980	will never
135981	be heard
135982	in you
135983	
135984	again.
135985	
135986	
135987	For your merchants
135988	
135989	were
135990	
135991	the tycoons
135992	of the
135993	world,
135994	
135995	by
135996	
135997	your magic spells!
135998	
135999	were deceived
136000	because all
136001	
136002	the nations
136003	
136004	in her,
136005	
136006	The blood
136007	and prophets
136008	
136009	of the saints
136010	was found
136011	
136012	along with the blood of all
136013	
136014	those who had been killed
136015	on
136016	
136017	the earth.”
136018	After
136019	
136020	these things I heard
136021	what sounded like
136022	voice
136023	the loud
136024	throng
136025	of a vast
136026	in
136027	
136028	heaven,
136029	saying,
136030	“Hallelujah!
136031	
136032	Salvation
136033	
136034	
136035	and glory

136037	
136038	and power
136039	
136040	belong to our God,
136041	
136042	
136043	are true
136044	
136045	and just.
136046	
136047	because his judgments
136048	
136049	
136050	For he has judged
136051	
136052	prostitute
136053	
136054	the great
136055	who
136056	corrupted
136057	
136058	the earth
136059	with
136060	
136061	her sexual immorality,
136062	
136063	
136064	and has avenged
136065	
136066	the blood
136067	
136068	of his servants
136069	
136070	poured out by
136071	her own hands!”
136072	
136073	
136074	Then a second time
136075	the crowd shouted,
136076	“Hallelujah!”
136077	
136078	
136079	The smoke
136080	
136081	rises from her
136082	
136083	
136084	forever
136085	
136086	and ever.
136087	
136088	threw
136089	
136090	elders
136091	
136092	The twenty-
136093	four
136094	
136095	
136096	and the four
136097	living creatures
136098	
136099	themselves to the ground and worshiped
136100	
136101	God,
136102	
136103	who was seated
136104	on
136105	
136106	the throne,
136107	saying:
136108	“Amen!
136109	Hallelujah!”
136110	
136111	Then a voice
136112	from
136113	
136114	the throne,
136115	came
136116	saying:
136117	“Praise

136129	
136130	both the small
136131	
136132	
136133	and the great!”
136134	
136135	Then I heard
136136	what sounded like
136137	the voice
136138	throng,
136139	of a vast
136140	
136141	like
136142	the roar
136143	waters
136144	of many
136145	
136146	and like
136147	crashes
136148	of thunder.
136149	loud
136150	They were shouting:
136151	“Hallelujah!
136152	
136153	reigns!
136154	For the Lord
136155	
136156	our God,

136176	and his bride
136177	
136178	has made
136179	herself ready.
136180	
136181	She was permitted
136182	
136183	to
136184	be dressed in
136185	fine linen”
136186	bright,
136187	clean,
136188	
136189	
136190	(for the fine linen
136191	
136192	the righteous deeds
136193	
136194	of the saints).
136195	is
136196	
136197	Then the angel said to me,
136198	
136199	“Write
136200	the following: Blessed
136201	
136202	to
136203

136209	are those who are invited

136214	
136215	words
136216	the true
136217	
136218	of God.”
136219	also said to me, “These are
136220	
136221	So I threw
136222	
136223	
136224	myself down at his feet
136225	
136226	to worship him,
136227	
136228	
136229	but he said,
136230	
136231	do
136232	“Do not
136233	only a fellow servant with you
136234	
136235	this! I am

136237	
136238	and your brothers and sisters
136239	
136240	
136241	who hold

136254	the spirit

136256	of prophecy.”
136257	
136258	Then I saw
136259	
136260	heaven
136261	opened
136262	
136263	and here came
136264	horse!

136274	and “True,”
136275	
136276	and with
136277	justice
136278	he judges
136279	
136280	and goes to war.
136281	
136282	
136283	His eyes
136284	
136285	
136286	flame
136287	are like a fiery

136291	his head.

136302	except himself.
136303	
136304	
136305	He is dressed in

136308	in blood,
136309	and
136310	is called
136311	
136312	
136313	he
136314	
136315	the Word
136316	
136317	of God.
136318	
136319	
136320	The armies
136321	
136322	that are in
136323	
136324	heaven,
136325	were following him
136326	
136327	on
136328	horses.
136329	white,
136330	dressed in
136331	fine linen,
136332	white
136333	clean,
136334	
136335	From
136336	
136337	his mouth
136338	
136339	extends
136340	sword,
136341	a sharp
136342	so that
136343	with
136344	
136345	it he can strike
136346	
136347	the nations.
136348	
136349	
136350	He will rule them
136351	
136352	with
136353	rod,
136354	an iron
136355	
136356	
136357	and he stomps
136358	
136359	the winepress
136360	
136361	
136362	
136363	of the furious
136364	
136365	wrath
136366	
136367	of God,
136368	
136369	the All-Powerful.
136370	
136371	He has
136372	on
136373	
136374	his clothing
136375	
136376	and on
136377	
136378	his thigh:
136379	
136380	a name
136381	written
136382	“King
136383	of kings
136384	
136385	and Lord
136386	of lords.”
136387	
136388	Then I saw
136389	one
136390	angel
136391	standing
136392	in
136393	
136394	the sun,
136395	
136396	and he shouted
136397	in
136398	voice
136399	a loud
136400	
136401	to all
136402	
136403	the birds
136404	
136405	flying
136406	
136407	high in the sky:
136408	“Come,
136409	gather around
136410	for
136411	
136412	banquet
136413	
136414	the great
136415	
136416	of God,
136417	to
136418	eat
136419	your fill of the flesh
136420	of kings,
136421	
136422	the flesh
136423	of generals,
136424	
136425	the flesh
136426	of powerful people,
136427	
136428	the flesh
136429	of horses
136430	
136431	
136432	and those who ride them,
136433	
136434	
136435	
136436	and the flesh
136437	of all people,
136438	free
136439	both
136440	
136441	and slave,
136442	
136443	and small
136444	
136445	and great!”
136446	
136447	Then I saw
136448	
136449	the beast
136450	
136451	
136452	and the kings
136453	
136454	of the earth
136455	
136456	
136457	and their armies
136458	
136459	assembled
136460	to do
136461	
136462	battle
136463	with
136464	
136465	the one who rode
136466	
136467	
136468	the horse
136469	
136470	and with
136471	
136472	his army.
136473	
136474	
136475	was seized,
136476	
136477	Now the beast
136478	
136479	and along with him
136480	
136481	
136482	the false prophet
136483	
136484	who had performed
136485	
136486	the signs
136487	on
136488	
136489	his behalf – signs by
136490	which
136491	he deceived
136492	
136493	those who had received
136494	
136495	the mark
136496	
136497	of the beast
136498	
136499	
136500	and those who worshiped
136501	
136502	his image.
136503	
136504	alive
136505	of them were thrown
136506	
136507	Both
136508	into
136509	
136510	the lake
136511	
136512	of fire
136513	
136514	burning
136515	with
136516	sulfur.
136517	
136518	
136519	The others
136520	were killed
136521	by
136522	
136523	the sword
136524	
136525	of the one who rode
136526	
136527	
136528	the horse,
136529	
136530	that extended
136531	from
136532	
136533	the mouth
136534	
136535	
136536	and all
136537	
136538	the birds
136539	gorged
136540	themselves with
136541	
136542	their flesh.
136543	
136544	
136545	Then I saw
136546	an angel
136547	descending
136548	from
136549	
136550	heaven,
136551	holding
136552	
136553	the key
136554	
136555	to the abyss
136556	
136557	chain.
136558	and a huge
136559	in
136560	
136561	his hand
136562	
136563	
136564	He seized
136565	
136566	the dragon –
136567	
136568	serpent,
136569	
136570	the ancient
136571	who
136572	is
136573	the devil
136574	
136575	
136576	and Satan –
136577	
136578	and tied him
136579	
136580	up for a thousand
136581	years.
136582	
136583	The angel then threw him
136584	
136585	into
136586	
136587	the abyss
136588	
136589	and locked
136590	
136591	and sealed
136592	
136593	
136594	it so that
136595	he could not
136596	deceive
136597	
136598	
136599	the nations
136600	until
136601	were finished.
136602	
136603	the one thousand
136604	years
136605	(After
136606	
136607	these things he must
136608	be released
136609	
136610	for a brief period
136611	of time.)
136612	
136613	Then I saw
136614	thrones
136615	
136616	and seated
136617	on them
136618	
136619	
136620	authority to judge.
136621	were those who had been given
136622	
136623	
136624	
136625	I also saw the souls
136626	of those who had
136627	been beheaded
136628	because of
136629	
136630	the testimony
136631	about Jesus
136632	
136633	and because of
136634	
136635	the word
136636	
136637	of God.
136638	
136639	These
136640	had not
136641	worshiped
136642	
136643	the beast
136644	or
136645	
136646	his image
136647	
136648	and
136649	had refused
136650	to receive
136651	
136652	his mark
136653	on
136654	
136655	their forehead
136656	
136657	
136658	
136659	or hand.
136660	
136661	
136662	They came to life
136663	
136664	and reigned
136665	with
136666	
136667	Christ
136668	for a thousand
136669	years.
136670	
136671	(The rest
136672	
136673	of the dead
136674	did not
136675	come to life
136676	until
136677	were finished.)
136678	
136679	the thousand
136680	years
136681	
136682	
136683	resurrection.
136684	
136685	This is the first
136686	Blessed
136687	
136688	and holy
136689	
136690	is the one who takes
136691	part
136692	in
136693	
136694	resurrection.
136695	
136696	the first
136697	
136698	
136699	
136700	The second
136701	death
136702	no
136703	has
136704	power
136705	over them, but
136706	they will be
136707	priests
136708	
136709	of God
136710	
136711	
136712	and of Christ,
136713	
136714	and they will reign
136715	with him
136716	
136717	
136718	for a thousand
136719	years.
136720	
136721	Now when
136722	are finished,
136723	
136724	the thousand
136725	years
136726	will be released
136727	
136728	Satan
136729	from
136730	
136731	his prison
136732	
136733	
136734	and will go out
136735	to deceive
136736	
136737	the nations
136738	
136739	at
136740	
136741	the four
136742	corners
136743	
136744	of the earth,
136745	
136746	Gog
136747	
136748	and Magog,
136749	to bring
136750	them together
136751	for
136752	
136753	the battle.
136754	They are
136755	
136756	as numerous
136757	
136758	as
136759	
136760	the grains of sand
136761	
136762	in the sea.
136763	
136764	They went up
136765	on
136766	
136767	the broad plain
136768	
136769	of the earth
136770	
136771	and encircled
136772	
136773	the camp
136774	
136775	of the saints
136776	
136777	
136778	city,
136779	
136780	and the beloved
136781	
136782	came down
136783	but fire
136784	from
136785	
136786	heaven
136787	
136788	and devoured
136789	them completely.
136790	
136791	
136792	And the devil
136793	
136794	who deceived them
136795	
136796	was thrown
136797	into
136798	
136799	the lake
136800	
136801	of fire
136802	
136803	and sulfur,
136804	where
136805	
136806	
136807	the beast
136808	
136809	
136810	and the false prophet
136811	
136812	are too, and they will be tormented
136813	there day
136814	
136815	and night
136816	
136817	
136818	forever
136819	
136820	and ever.
136821	
136822	Then I saw
136823	throne
136824	a large
136825	white
136826	
136827	
136828	and the one who was seated
136829	on it;
136830	
136831	
136832	from
136833	
136834	his presence,
136835	fled
136836	
136837	the earth
136838	
136839	
136840	and the heaven
136841	
136842	place
136843	and no
136844	was found for them.
136845	
136846	
136847	And I saw
136848	
136849	the dead,
136850	
136851	the great
136852	
136853	
136854	and the small,
136855	standing
136856	before
136857	
136858	the throne.
136859	
136860	Then books
136861	were opened,
136862	
136863	and another
136864	book
136865	was opened –
136866	
136867	
136868	
136869	the book of life.
136870	
136871	were judged
136872	
136873	So the dead
136874	by
136875	
136876	what was written
136877	in
136878	
136879	the books,
136880	according to
136881	
136882	their deeds.
136883	
136884	
136885	gave up
136886	
136887	The sea
136888	
136889	the dead
136890	
136891	that were in it,
136892	
136893	
136894	
136895	and Death
136896	
136897	
136898	and Hades
136899	gave up
136900	
136901	the dead
136902	
136903	that were in them,
136904	
136905	
136906	was judged
136907	and each one
136908	according to
136909	
136910	his deeds.
136911	
136912	
136913	
136914	Then Death
136915	
136916	
136917	and Hades
136918	were thrown
136919	into
136920	
136921	the lake
136922	
136923	of fire.
136924	
136925	
136926	death –
136927	
136928	the second
136929	This is
136930	
136931	the lake
136932	
136933	of fire.
136934	
136935	If
136936	anyone’s
136937	name was not
136938	found
136939	in
136940	
136941	the book
136942	
136943	of life,
136944	written
136945	that person was thrown
136946	into
136947	
136948	the lake
136949	
136950	of fire.
136951	
136952	Then I saw
136953	heaven
136954	a new
136955	
136956	earth,
136957	and a new
136958	
136959	for
136960	the first
136961	heaven
136962	
136963	
136964	
136965	and earth
136966	had ceased to exist,
136967	
136968	
136969	and the sea
136970	no
136971	existed
136972	more.
136973	
136974	
136975	city –
136976	
136977	the holy
136978	Jerusalem –
136979	the new
136980	And I saw
136981	descending
136982	out of
136983	
136984	heaven
136985	from
136986	
136987	God,
136988	made ready
136989	like
136990	a bride
136991	adorned
136992	
136993	for her husband.
136994	
136995	
136996	And I heard
136997	voice
136998	a loud
136999	from
137000	
137001	the throne
137002	saying:
137003	“Look!
137004	
137005	The residence
137006	
137007	of God
137008	is among
137009	
137010	human beings.
137011	
137012	He will live
137013	among them,
137014	
137015	
137016	
137017	his people,
137018	
137019	and they will be
137020	
137021	
137022	
137023	and God himself
137024	with them.
137025	
137026	will be
137027	
137028	
137029	
137030	He will wipe away
137031	every

137033	from
137034	
137035	their eyes,
137036	
137037	
137038	
137039	and death
137040	not
137041	will
137042	any more –
137043	or
137044	mourning,
137045	or
137046	crying,
137047	or
137048	pain,

137051	
137052	
137053	
137054	for the former things
137055	have ceased to exist.”
137056	
137057	said:
137058	
137059	And the one seated
137060	on
137061	
137062	the throne
137063	“Look!
137064	new!”
137065	I am making
137066	all things
137067	
137068	to me, “Write
137069	Then he said
137070	
137071	
137072	
137073	it down, because these words
137074	reliable
137075	
137076	and true.”
137077	are
137078	
137079	He also said to me,
137080	
137081	“It is done!
137082	
137083	I am
137084	
137085	the Alpha
137086	
137087	
137088	and the Omega,
137089	
137090	the beginning
137091	
137092	
137093	and the end.
137094	
137095	
137096	To the one who is thirsty
137097	I will give
137098	from
137099	
137100	the spring
137101	
137102	water
137103	
137104	of the water of life.
137105	free of charge
137106	
137107	The one who conquers
137108	will inherit
137109	
137110	
137111	these things, and I will be
137112	
137113	his God
137114	
137115	
137116	and he will be
137117	
137118	my son.
137119	
137120	But
137121	as for the cowards,
137122	
137123	unbelievers,
137124	
137125	detestable persons,
137126	
137127	murderers,
137128	
137129	the sexually immoral,
137130	
137131	and those who practice magic spells,
137132	
137133	idol worshipers,
137134	
137135	and all
137136	
137137	those who lie,
137138	
137139	
137140	
137141	their place will be in
137142	
137143	the lake
137144	
137145	that burns
137146	with fire
137147	
137148	and sulfur.
137149	That
137150	is
137151	
137152	death.”
137153	
137154	the second
137155	
137156	came
137157	Then one
137158	
137159	
137160	of the seven
137161	angels
137162	
137163	who had
137164	
137165	the seven
137166	bowls
137167	
137168	full
137169	
137170	of the seven
137171	plagues
137172	
137173	final
137174	
137175	and spoke
137176	to me,
137177	
137178	saying,
137179	“Come,
137180	I will show you
137181	
137182	
137183	the bride,
137184	
137185	the wife
137186	
137187	of the Lamb!”
137188	
137189	So he took me
137190	
137191	away in
137192	the Spirit
137193	to
137194	mountain
137195	a huge,

137561	the Lamb’s

137564	
137565	the river
137566	of the water
137567	of life –
137568	water as clear
137569	
137570	as crystal –
137571	pouring out

137578	
137579	and of the Lamb,
137580	flowing down

137583	of the city’s main street.
137584	
137585	
137586	
137587	of the river
137588	
137589	
137590	On each side
137591	is the tree
137592	of life
137593	producing
137594	kinds of fruit,
137595	twelve
137596	every
137597	month
137598	
137599	yielding
137600	
137601	its fruit
137602	
137603	
137604	
137605	leaves
137606	
137607	of the year. Its
137608	are for
137609	the healing
137610	
137611	of the nations.
137612	
137613	any
137614	curse,
137615	And there will no
137616	be
137617	longer
137618	
137619	
137620	and the throne
137621	
137622	of God
137623	
137624	
137625	and the Lamb
137626	in
137627	
137628	will be
137629	
137630	
137631	the city. His servants
137632	
137633	will worship him,
137634	
137635	
137636	and they will see
137637	
137638	his face,
137639	
137640	
137641	
137642	and his name
137643	
137644	will be on
137645	
137646	their foreheads.
137647	
137648	
137649	Night
137650	no
137651	will be
137652	more,
137653	
137654	and they will not
137655	and they will
137656	need
137657	the light
137658	of a lamp
137659	
137660	or the light
137661	of the sun,
137662	
137663	because the Lord
137664	
137665	God
137666	will shine
137667	on them,
137668	
137669	
137670	reign
137671	
137672	
137673	forever
137674	
137675	and ever.
137676	
137677	Then the angel said to me,
137678	
137679	
137680	
137681	“These words
137682	are reliable
137683	
137684	and true.
137685	
137686	
137687	The Lord,
137688	
137689	the God
137690	
137691	of the spirits
137692	
137693	of the prophets,
137694	has sent
137695	
137696	his angel
137697	
137698	to show
137699	
137700	his servants
137701	
137702	what
137703	must
137704	happen
137705	
137706	soon.”
137707	
137708	(Look!
137709	I am coming
137710	soon!
137711	Blessed
137712	
137713	is the one who keeps
137714	
137715	the words
137716	
137717	of the prophecy
137718	
137719	expressed in this book.)
137720	
137721	I,
137722	John,
137723	
137724	am the one who heard
137725	
137726	and saw
137727	
137728	
137729	these things, and when
137730	I heard
137731	
137732	and saw
137733	them, I threw
137734	myself down to worship
137735	at
137736	
137737	the feet
137738	
137739	of the angel
137740	
137741	who was showing them to me.
